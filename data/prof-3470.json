            "review_content": "\nDr. Humphries made this the worst course I have taken at Columbia--ever.  The readings were interesting, but the syllabus was cluttered and readings almost never related to one another.  Dr. Humphries was a horror.  She fostered a decidedly hostile environment in the classroom.  Stay away!  I got an A in the class but getting through each 2 hour seminar was treacherous.\nWorkload:\n10+ reading assignments each week, which often overlapped and taught no new information.  7 2 page diary entries not graded.  1 presentation not graded.  3 Vital essays--essays based on videos.  The videos were home videos Dr. Humphries recorded of other lectures, including one video of a professor reading word-for-word her academic essay that we had already read.  1 research paper on a topic of your choice (10 pgs) worth 50% of your grade.\n"
