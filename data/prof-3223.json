Grad students expect the level of leadership that this class demands so I'm mainly writing this for any undergrads accepted in the future: Its a lot of work and thinking. You will do some of your best work in this class since you are required to design your own research theory and plan and carry it out. If you listen and learn, you will become a better interviewer and learn from your mistakes.  If interviewing people is going to be important for your future scholarship, take this very time consuming class with this Extraordinary professor. \nWorkload:\nLots of reading, Listening to interviews (time consuming), two of your own interviews, transcribing an interview, annotation (analysis) of a portion of your interview.  \n"
