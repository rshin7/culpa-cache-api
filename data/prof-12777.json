We spent the first day learning each other's names and we ended up really good friends by the end of the semester thank to her. She picks out field trips that are relevant to our class material. She is really kind and always happy to see students at her office hours. Professor Legutko is also very competent, I learned a lot from her. \nWorkload:\nVery reasonable- weekly responses,standard midterm and final with two papers. The second paper was a creative project of our choice- very nice of her.\n"
