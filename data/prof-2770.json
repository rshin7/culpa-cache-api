            "review_content": "\nNorden is an extremely caring professor, if not the nicest professor in the department. His lectures are well-organized and clear, and you can learn a lot simply from his readings.  It's a great class to take if you're interested in the quantitative aspect of management and consulting case-studies.  He is also willing to write recommendations for you since he makes a point of getting to know you during a conference during the semester.  I highly recommend any class with him.\nWorkload:\nManageable. Problem sets, readings, a case consulting presentation that accounts for a huge bulk of the grade, midterm, final.  Very straightforward from class lectures and generous grading.\n"
