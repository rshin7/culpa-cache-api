            "review_content": "\nMr. Azab is a kind and helpful instructor. He always gave us a lot of extra time outside of class if we needed it, and was invested in our success. I'm really glad I decided to take French 1101 with him, even though the time was horrible (MWF 6:10-7:25). He's really good at teaching grammar and pronunciation, which I appreciated, but I still have a lot of trouble with speaking, even though we're not supposed to speak any English in class. I hope that I can continue to study French with him in the future.\nWorkload:\n30 minutes or less a night, except when there are tests coming up. Four tests, four compositions, a mid-term oral presentation, and one 3-hour final exam.\n"
