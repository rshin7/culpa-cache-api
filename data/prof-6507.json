Each class she would bring in a slide show of different artists work that related to the project that day. These slideshows were so fascinating and were more informative than a lot of my art history lectures. The different exercises we did throughout the course were fun, innovative, and most importantly effective in making us become better painters. I highly recommend that anyone remotely interested in studying the visual arts take Allison's class. It's so worth it!\nWorkload:\nThere was no work outside of studio time, which was absolutely fantastic!\n"
