            "review_content": "\nProf. Postlewate is a great teacher, she's friendly, funny and engaging. This class is participation based, but it's not daunting. The class breakup is very reasonable and it's really easy to do well. She makes herself really available for help if needed. We use voice thread a lot to practice our French speaking skills and engage the vocabulary in different ways. We also have 4 debates (you only participate in one for your grade, though) about things like marriage equality, the French vs. American school system, freedom of speech and privacy and I forget the last one. We watch one film, La faute \u00c3\u00a0 Fidel!, though I'm not sure if it changes with each class. Overall this class was great, and it's the perfect amount of work. The grade breakdown makes it relatively easy to do well if you try. She's also really understanding if you have to turn in something late, just be honest.\nWorkload:\n20% participation, 40% compositions (4, 2-4page papers & there are revisions so you can get the best grade possible), 20% for the debate, 10% for weekly journal entries and I can't remember what the other 10% is for... I think the voice thread. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI can't believe Postlewate doesn't get a gold nugget. She always encourages participation and she's really funny. In general, this class is really cool, but mostly, I just really like her.  She's must be the kindest professor I've met, especially since she goes to incredible measures to help you do as well as possible.  Even if I come out of this class with a not-fantastic grade, I'd still say she's wonderful because she does truly anything that she can fairly do to teach you and give you the best experience possible.  All in all, really cool lady, pretty cool class.  What I will say is, don't mistake her for having low standards for giving easy tests.  She wants you to learn so her tests are pretty difficult.  She also expects you to take your time and put in an effort when you write her a papers, though you get two drafts (the first one counts for part of the grade).  If you want a French class for an easy A, I wouldn't take this.  It's a real class, and a good one.  \nWorkload:\nOften light, sometimes medium reading (because it's in French), periodic reading/homework responses, one group presentation (she was very lax about this, I thought), a midterm (relatively tough), two short papers, and a take home final.  \n"

I was nervous about learning grammar in french, but she does a very good job of explaining grammatical concepts without switching into english. \nTalking in her class wasn't an intimidating experience. She's extremely friendly and wants everyone to talk. We read a murder mystery and a satire in class and for homework, which lead to some funny french discussions. \nThe point is, Postlewate rocks. And, for what it's worth, she also has an amazing sense of style as well. =]\nWorkload:\nEasy midterm, final, four quizzes that are easy if you study, three essays with a revision for a higher grade\n"

            "review_content": "\nAt the beginning the material is somewhat boring, starting with some cumbersome 7th century texts, but the course moves very quickly into more modern and interesting territory. Studying the early development of French in France provides a foundation for analyzing later linguistic developments in the areas that France colonized. You also look at issues of language politics in education and government.  By the end I loved the course. \n(Note: If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t study Latin, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be scared away by the half-Latin half-texts in the beginning. I just read the translations and everything worked out fine in the end. You move past this quickly.)\nProfessor Postlewate is awesome. She is very approachable during class and during office hours. \n\nWorkload:\nLots of reading that you should, for the most part, keep up with even if you just skim. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine to miss a few, but one day everyone in my class hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read and she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pleased. \nClass discussion is very crucial, but you can definitely get by with a basic understanding and a willingness to discuss. \n One in-depth presentation on language history in a francophone country of your choice, along with a 5-page paper. Take home midterm, another 5 page paper, and a take home final. \nNot bad overall. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in French and history, it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be difficult. \n\n"

The conversations were great and the readings were really useful. It is a great mix of literature and history. To give you an idea of just how understanding she is she allowed us to rewrite a paper and she boosted our grades. She makes out of class appointments and is very encouraging. It is great. \nI would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to read but also be given a historical context for the readings. \nProf. Postlewate rocks!!! \nWorkload:\n2 five-page papers, 1 eight-page paper, and 1 final. Readings every week. Very manageable. \n"

To make it even better, her French is flawless, so she knows what she is talking about. This course was a great review of French grammar, and I even learned a few new things. Writing compositions in French was not always fun, but she's very flexible with the deadlines. However, don't always expect papers to be returned promptly; while sometimes she'll have them back to you within hours, most of the time it will be a week or two, after which you will have to do revisions on the paper. However, if she does not return a paper to you until the day the second draft is due, you will have an extra week or so to hand it in. Overall, I highly recommend Professor Postlewate. If you're interested in improving your writing in French, this is definitely the class for you.\nWorkload:\nMany workbook exercises for each class, but she posts the answers online so you can correct them beforehand. Six compositions, 2-4 pages each, final grade is the average grade of the first and second drafts. Four quizzes and a final. \n"

Reacting is the kind of class that the more you do for it, the more you get out of it.

She is extremely knowledgeable and is a great professor. Take this class!!!\nWorkload:\nNot bad at all.

Professor Postlewate makes, as cliched as it sounds, history come alive. Although readings are (with the exception of perhaps one) all in French, as is the class, but surprisingly nothing seems dry when she teaches it. Cannot reccomend this teacher enough. A must for anyone who says they don't like history (and can speak French). She is also extremely understanding and accomodating (for example, she put off our papers another week when she thought we didn't have enough time), and is very easily approachable. Again, a wonderful professor to have.\nWorkload:\nGrade was based on a midterm (15%), a non-research paper  (15%), a research paper on a topic of our choice (20%), a final from the last half of the semester (25%), and participation/class attendance (25%)\n"
