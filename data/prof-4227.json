Its a wastage of time attending her lecture.\nIts better to study by yourself from book as her lectures does not contain anything new.\nWhen you ask her some doubt, you will find that doubt is still doubt.\nMoreover, she is very harsh to the students, in short not at all student friendly. She even does not listen to the student's problems. Her grading is also very strict. I will suggest not to take this course under her. \n. \n"
