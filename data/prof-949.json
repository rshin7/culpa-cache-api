Class is not too difficult. Professor is very nice when it comes to responding to questions via email or during class and takes the time to hold review sessions during the weekends or on Fridays.\nWorkload:\nStudy hard for the tests - no trick questins but definitely need to know a lot of detail to write good essays and know the answers for fill ins.\n"
