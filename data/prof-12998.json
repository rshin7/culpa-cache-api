She's very approachable, understanding and overall an extremely sweet person. Her readings are all interesting which makes it easier when writing the papers. Her feedback is always precise and clear so take advantage of her office hours!! \nI have grown so much as a writer, I HIGLY recommend taking UW with Emma!\nWorkload:\nSame as any UW class, 3 papers and the final paper.\n"
