The class topic itself is deceptively simple\u2014it grows increasingly complicated but Prof. Landman does a great job of layering on top of previous classes, recapping what we learned last class before introducing the next steps. I found the class, especially tree drawing, to be super fun, like figuring out puzzles, and the squib project was a fun way to apply our learned skills to \"real problems\". It's mandatory for all linguistic majors anyway, so you have to take it, but if you have an interest in language and how we form sentences, I'd recommend the class! \nWorkload:\nManageable\nPrimer readings for class, 5 Homeworks (some collaborative), 2 exams, final project (Squib) and presentation\n\n"
