            "review_content": "\nHiking is a perfect mixture of a fun activity and minimal time commitment.  Karl offers 4 hikes, of which you choose 3 to attend.  The hikes start on Sunday morning at 8 AM and, though the syllabus says that they end at 5 PM, the class was often over by 2 or 3 PM.  Take the class in the fall: the scenery and weather are great in October and November.  In terms of physical effort, the hikes range from moderate to strenuous (Bear Mountain); the hardest part of the class is the \"short\" 5-mile run you do before signing up for the class.  Other than that, I had no complaints.  Karl is a good guy: he even prepares Argentinian tea for the class on the last hike.  Sure, it was an acquired taste, but the thought was certainly appreciated.\nWorkload:\nYou sacrifice your Sunday, but only thrice.  After that, you're home free.\n"
