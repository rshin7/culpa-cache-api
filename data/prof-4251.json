He was a pretty easy grader (at least from my experiences), but he still gives great comments on the essays. Expect him to lead the discussion and to examine the works in a couple of different ways.\nWorkload:\nA little less than average amount of reading, a midterm and final (both include short answers and an essay or two), 2 papers (5 pages each), the final is cumulative\n"
