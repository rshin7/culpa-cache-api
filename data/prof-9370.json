            "review_content": "\nThis course is easy, easy, easy. The lectures are pretty interesting and relatively basic, meaning that if you happen watch or check the news, you'll understand the course. Cronin is a nice guy and a funny lecturer - the kind of teacher that you want at 9 in the morning. Dianne is also the TA you want. She's a nice TA and she's a really easy grader.\nSkim as much of the reading that you can, but don't stress about it too much. Focus on the beginning material (the foundations of American foreign policy) and the section on \"security policy:\" security policy was the focus of the take-home final this semester but it could change to something like economic policy next term.\nWorkload:\nsimple midterm, take-home final, \"decision-making simulation\" with two 2-page papers on topics like the war in afghanistan and israel/palestine, weekly discussion. Hastedt and Forsythe are the important books to read.\n"
