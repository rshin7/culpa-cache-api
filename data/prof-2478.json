Barry, though at the front of the political theory field, is old and boring, droning on about tangential issues for 2 straight hours. It was the worst part of my week all semester -- I had to waste my time and money listening to him mutter about something or the other. Horrible.\nWorkload:\nA moderate amount of reading you won't do because there's no reason to. Grading is based soley on a 25 pg paper at the end, which has no foundation in any of the readings. He doesn't take attendence either, so you will be very, very tempted just to skip. Also, one response paper you defend to the class (although he probably won't let you get two words in).\n"
