Certain amount of grouchiness you will have to deal with, but a personality quirk which becomes rather endearing after a bit, another of which is going off on tangents about Germanic linguistic structures, especially the 19th century variety, but those are - admittedly - fascinating nuggets. \nA non-native speaker of German, if that makes a difference. \nWorkload:\nTypical: class participation and attendance, daily assignments, a test every two weeks, short essays. \n"
