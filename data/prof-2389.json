Really good in every possible way, though sometimes the discussions went a bit haywire when people didn't do the reading and started to talk excessively about their personal experiences. Most of the time everything was great. \nWorkload:\nReading: very heavy, but you can skim for most of it, since most of the reading wasn't really covered in depth in class anyway, which is unfortunate, because it was usually fantastic!). 5-7 pg midterm paper and 10-12 page final paper on your choice. All very interesting and fun (as fun as assignments go). Definitely ask him for help and go to his office hours if you can: it really helps!\n"
