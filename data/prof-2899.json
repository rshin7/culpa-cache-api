Not only were we encouraged to throw modeling clay on the first day of class but as long as you were serious, you could do what ever the hell you wanted to do.  Lisi is really generous with her feedback and helped me understand things about three dimensional forms that I wasn't getting.\nThe class was a lot more work than I expected though - so if you do it, be prepared to work at least 5 or more hours outside of class.\nWorkload:\na lot\n"
