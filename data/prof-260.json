As the semester wore on, though, I started to see a sick sort of Dalton-worshiping in the halls of Barnard.  No one saw the hypocrisy in that they were unquestioningly following the words of a man who preaches questioning our sole existence. If nothing else, this class made me embarrassed by my swooning Barnard peers and the mindlessness with which they took in his words.  \nHe blatantly discouraged students from following their dreams by handing out papers and advice pitted against certain professions.  His closemindedness towards professions in law, business and government make it all the more obvious that he himself could use a little truth-\npursued indoctrination.  \n"

There is always a line after class of students that want to hug him for such an inspiring lecture. It gets to be a little much. \nEspecially for a man, who although he is very kind and intelligent, only expresses the most biased perspective on any issue. He stifles creative thought. I did gain a general understanding of Plato, Aristotle, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which I believe is very important, especially for Barnard students who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take Columbia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core. His lectures are enjoyable enough but they are all the same and I often found myself looking at the clock. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you not to take the class, but I would not necessarily recommend it. Maybe I have a bitter taste in my mouth because I did exceptionally well on the midterm, but not as well on the final. He removes points for unspecific reasons. I found that my friends who memorized the 8 pages of answers they prepared before the test that simply regurgitates his thoughts did better than those who went into the test prepared, although not memorized. So if you can memorize I would do it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6he wants to hear his words of wisdom mindlessly repeated back to him.\n"

The first few classes were very interesting and inspiring, but it became very repetitive and I stopped going after the midterm. The class is centered around the theme of idealism vs. realism, which I found to be too simplistic (and he is also heavily biased towards the idealists).

Accessibility and his 'do no harm' principle are his most powerful attributes. \nSome people have to realize that college is not about memorizing facts, historical events etc. College is about making you a better person, in order to be able to legitimately BECOME PART of history in a  unique, admirable Way.\nThankfully, Dalton has realized that, and helps us in the most efficient and virtuous way. There was not even one lecture when i left without experiencing a 'catharsis'. This person has the unique ability to wash away all your malevolence by instiling benevolence and the 'do no harm' rule in your minds and souls. \nIf there is anyone who realizes the value of all the above,  just take his class.\nIts too bad this 'agent of benevolence' is leaving us next year.\nI know this sounds cliche, but i love him.\nWorkload:\nReadings which dont need to be done.

When you email him with comments/questions, he emails you right back with a lengthy, well thought out response, and even commented on my great performance on the midterm (as in, he remembered who i was - impressive for a CU prof). He loves answering questions and talking to students after class about the material, philosophy, or your life. He's become a great friend and I truly recommend taking this class, due to the inspiring nature of Dalton.\nThe readings are standard: Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli - all texts I had read before - but he illuminates them with clarity and joy and excitement. His politics are right on -\nthe only professor Ive had who addresses the war we are in and the outrageous atrocities of the Bush Administration - thank god someone is talking about it. \nAfter every class I walk out feeling refreshed and excited about life - I'm not kidding!

Rather, he knows exactly the power he has and he's happy to exert it; hence the students who gleefully - in their words - worship at the Dennis Dalton altar. It's totally unfair of him to run the class the way he does because it deprives the students of the education they expect the course to provide. And, as others have mentioned, his \"pursuit of truth\" stuff is all talk. He tells students (basically word-for-word) what they must answer for questions on the midterm and final.

I felt revitalized knowing that \"making the world a better place\" is not merely a whimsical fantasy but a palpable possibility already actualized by peace activists in other communities.  In a world ripping at the seams with exploitation and degradation, this course was nothing short of a beacon of hope. Through engaging class discussions and fascinating student presentations, you will learn that another type of world is indeed possible and harmonious coexistence is achievable. Honestly, I was practically moved to tears when this course was over. I am frustrated that a course that teaches people to find inner and outer peace is not part of Columbia\u00c2\u2019s Core.

He's a passionate, extremely knowledgable professor, but spends more time railing against George Bush and the war in Iraq or extolling Mahatma Gandhi than actually teaching the course.  He's also an extremely picky grader; the previous reviews are right in saying that he expects you to recite the packet to him.  But not only that, you had better know every detail in the packet because he nickel-and-dimes you into much lower grades with small deductions for every missed minor detail on the exams.  And if you're a preprofessional student, don't expect him to be sympathetic to your need for good grades when grading your exams.  He grades everyone's exams extremely hard and spends signficant class time urging students to spend a few years working for Teach for America rather than attending medical or law school.  The bottom line: Dalton is great if you're a political liberal who is against all wars and doesn't care too much about grades.

Judging by the final grades of those that did the optional stuff and those that didnt, they arent optional. Everyone (10+ people) that I knew that only took the final got a C in this class, with the exception of one student who got a B-. If you are looking for an easy grade this is not it. Yes the class is easy, very easy. It seems like a cake class until you get your final grade back and you are sitting on the worst grade you have ever gotten at Columbia. I have two critical thoughts on the class: Either the grades were based on whether or not you did the optional work (where those people that did had their work graded much easier), or they were graded on how much of what he spoon-fed you you regurgitated back up on the final. Columbia is about enabling students to think for themselves and formulate their own opinions on the texts that are read. This class was exactly the opposite of that ideal. If you think for yourself you are penalized. Finally, I would not argue that he's a nice guy in class. I am weary, however, of how much he really cares about his students. I think it is a show, and I think that the emails that he reads in class are a show. I think they are written by him in an attempt by him to make students feel that he is in touch with them. Also, it is very ironic how those emails read at the beginning of class act as a perfect transition from the previous class to the later class discussion.\nWorkload:\nWorkload is a joke, however grading is extreme.

I can see why someone would say that he does not see other points of view, but if you stay for the discussion sections or email/meet him, you'll see that he has thought about the opposing views. He's passionate about idealism but he's also been educated about realism and reformism. He's an incredibly caring, understanding, and thoughtful professor. If you feel that you're open to lectures that will have a good focus and will allow you to understand the major tenets of political theory, I encourage you to take this class. I don't think it's for everyone though-it may not question the opposing views as much as you would like. Still, he's one of the best professors I've had. I loved this course and learned so much. Visit him on office hours. And he's great about responding to emails, even right before an exam. \nWorkload:\nMidterm and a final. The midterm is optional.

What is most painful is watching first-years lap up his anti-intellectual garbage for \"wisdom.\" In fact, those who will attack this review are simply following Dalton's lead: only ONE interpretation can be heard; all others must be squashed out before they can balloon into malignant tumors. That said, it is without hesitation that I do not recommend taking this mind-numbing farce.\nWorkload:\n1 Midterm (optional), 1 Final (to which Dalton came 1 hour late).\n"

If you are really interested in the topic, Dalton is an extremely enthusiastic guy who brings current events in politics to compare to the ancient philosophers and politicians studied in class. Although an idealist himself, he does a good job of showing the other side of the arguments as well. However, if you are just looking for a good grade while doing the least amount of work possible, this is also the class to take. you never have to show up for class or do any of the readings, and you can still ace the class. You can choose to make the final count as 100% of your grade by skipping the midterm. The great thing is that he gives you the final (and midterm if you choose to take it) a week or two before the test date. You're probably saying to yourself that this is too good to be true but it really isnt.  I didnt go to class for the last 2 months and if I dont get an A, I only have myself to blame. All the answers to the final are in the packet he gives out at the beginning of the year. Another good thing, is that the reading list uses a lot of the same books from CC, so you could knock out 2 birds with one stone.\nWorkload:\nBottom Line: this is a facelift for your GPA, and if you wanna learn a lot as well, this is also your type of class. The truth is, I don't see a reason not to take Daulton. Where else can five hours of studying get you a probable A and 3 credits?\n"

            "review_content": "\nCRITICAL REVIEW OF DALTON: I hate to use caps lock but I wanted to get people's attention away from all the praise of Dalton and actually offer some criticism. Dalton is a charismatic lecturer and very open to his students. However, this can only take the class so far. He is all flash but not much substance. You get only the basics of the authors you read which I suppose is fine for an intro class. However, for Columbia students this is redundant after spending so much time on this stuff in CC. Its frustrating to have taken a challenging class like CC but then take two steps back with Dalton. This problem is worsened because Dalton doesn't want you to think on your own. He only wants you to use on the midterm and final exactly what he said in class. Therefore, you have to forget the more advanced stuff you learned already in CC and concentrate on functioning like a parrot. I don't want this review to seem overly critical. Dalton's charisma compensates for the lack of content to an extent. He makes every effort to be available to students. However, the reviews I read seemed to be so in love with the guy that they ignored how high school the class is. I don't recommend you take the class but I do recommend that you sit in on it once ( to hear him speak, not for what he has to say.) Also, I was slightly disappointed by one other aspect of the class. Dalton leads you to believe he grades the midterms, finals and papers himself which I thought was an awesome sacrifice for a lecture class. There are no TA's ever in class, he never mentioned them or gave us an opportunity to contact them. He never referred to how the TA's would grade the midterms but only himself. However, I found out later that there are TA's that do all that stuff. This is no big deal. I do not expect a professor to worry about that stuff and Dalton certainly deals with students in other ways (responds to e-mails himself and leads discussion sections himself). Nevertheless, I did feel slightly misled.\nWorkload:\nMedium workload. Mainly focus on his lectures and outlines and know them perfectly because thats what he wants to hear.\n"

He, like Plato, wants everyone to find his or her arete and sometimes makes a crack at the large amount of people who pursue a career in law. Still, it is not surprising seeing the large amount of students who take him (so many that he needed a bigger classroom). I plan on taking Political Theory II. Also, he is very approachable.

If you want to sit through interminable lectures of ultra-liberal drivel, then by all means, take this course. The lectures and reading have nothing to do with the midterm or final. They're just rote memorization. His style is engaging for the first two lectures, when you think he's whipping you into an educational frenzy- but they don't stop. He keeps yelling and going off topic. He literally talked for 10 minutes one day about how all the girls in the class should buy this book that was a guided tour of the vagina. I don't see how this teaches us political theory. He also has this ridiculous theory that he will push down your throat about how all idealists and all realists are the same. I seriously doubt that Plato read ancient Chinese philosophy, but he claims that this is true. HOW? THE GREEKS DIDN'T HAVE TRANSCONTINENTAL TRAVEL! He also claims that he is objective and fair when dealing with the realists and the idealists, but he compared Machiavelli to Hitler. I would strongly recommend against this course for anyone who thinks independently and has a low tolerance for demogoguery.\nWorkload:\nYou don't have to do anything except memorize and regurgitate for the optional midterm and the final.

Student questions are far and few between, and he usually dismisses them with comments like \"sure, it's important to consider all issues, but the message I want this class to present is ...\" He constantly emphasizes the \"pursuit of truth,\" which is exemplified nicely in the readings and his anecdotes, but I'm not so sure the students have that opportunity to pursue truth given the manner the texts are taught with one interpretation in mind and how exams are graded for using certain buzzwords.
