He obviously knows the material, uses no notes but misses nothing, knows how to steer the class towards where he wants the class to be and knows how to improvise when it doesn't go as planned.\nAccessibility: surprisingly accessible after class, in OH. Quickly responds to emails. That said, he kind of expects you to ask the TAs course-related questions.\nGeneral: most importantly, Gulati enjoys the interaction with the students. He truly cares about the students personal opinions (or at least acts like he does really well). He enjoys teaching and it's both fun and demanding being in his class!\nIf you want to stay on top of your game in this class you have to do the reading before class. If you do that and revisit the material while learning for the pop quizzes, an A is very doable.\nWorkload:\nMidterm & Final\n7 pop quizzes\nPSETS that are very shallowly checked\n"

The math content of the course is very small; anyone with a passing familiarity with algebra should be fine. In fact, if you know calculus, you are going to be frustrated by how naive the math in principles is. But overall, if you read the book, attend recitations, and attend class, you should absorb most of the material.\nLecture itself is amazing; Gulati is a great teacher. He teaches the material with enthusiasm and clarity. The only drawback to lecture is it's time -- he perennially schedules the class at 8:40 am. \nYou can only do well in this class if you attend lecture. A fair portion of your grade is unannounced quizzes at 8:40 am sharp. In addition, Gulati's coverage of the material diverges from the text from time to time, so in class notes are a necessity. Do not take this class if you are not going to attend lecture and pay attention; Gulati will chastise students for cell phone use or sleeping and makes everyone answer questions.

He seemingly goes into the material at a much greater depth than the other professors teaching Principles.  If you are looking for a fantastic experience learning a lot about the basics of Econ, Gulati is your best bet.  If you just want to get through Principles as quickly and painlessly as possible, another teacher might be a better option.\nWorkload:\nThe workload is pretty high.

He taught microeconomics very well, and did an OK job at macroeconomics. At the end of the class, you will have be able to read the WSJ or NYTimes and understand what's happening economically in the world, which is very empowering. As an engineer, I can tell you that the knowledge gained in this class made me feel practically intelligent. You don't often see that in science classes where applications of the complicated yet mind-blowingly clever things you study are often esoteric.\nHe is sometimes merciless and arrogant, but it shouldn't affect you most of the time - just don't sleep/text in class or do something stupid on tests and you will not have to ever deal with him personally. He also isn't very responsive to students. You can't really talk with him or ask him doubts since he's always really busy with his FIFA career - that's what the TAs are for.\nTests and grading are the biggest drawback of this course. Gulati's class is harder than the other Intro Econ classes. Period.\n14% of your grade is determined by stupid in-class pop quizzes using the devices of the devil - iClickers. You have to answer 6 questions on topics he may not have covered yet with only 30 seconds for each. This was a really ineffective way to get everyone to attend lecture and read the textbook. It made class very stressful though since I often didn't have time to read the textbook before class.\nThe midterm was hard. He definitely should have given us more time. Problems on his sample tests were harder than stuff covered in class or problem sets. The final was slightly easier because it reused some questions from the sample finals. It was still hard though. If you can get above 80% in the midterm and final with 5/6 on most of the quizzes, you should be able to pull off an A.\nThe best way to study for this class is to make summarized notes when you read the chapter the first time (so you don't have to read it again - because it's impossible to read all 27 or so chapters before the final) and then read your class notes and these summaries before exams. Gulati generally gives out 4 practice tests before the midterm and final. Do these - they will help you immensely.\nTake this class for Principles of Economics! Gulati is definitely harder than the other professors, but you will learn so much more and actually enjoy the subject.\nWorkload:\n3 problem sets (6%)\n8 quizzes (lowest dropped) (14%)\n1 midterm (30%)\n1 final (50%)\n"

Half of the class is spent by him telling stories or asking hypothetical questions that never seem to have an answer and only leave you more confused.  He will call on 20 people to give an answer to one of these questions and waste a lot of your time in the process.  If only half of that time was spent on actually teaching the material the tests might have not been so stressful.  Gulati leaves large amounts of the material for you to learn on your own or attend recitation session and hope for the TA to fill in the gaps (mine was terrible and never did).  His tests were difficult and confusing and usually covered a lot of material in depth that was never mentioned in class or merely glossed over.  If you plan on taking this course be prepared to read the textbook and struggle through some painful exams.

            "review_content": "\nFirst, I would like to say that although CULPA reviews are generally useful in picking classes and professors, their objectivity is severely compromised by response bias. People who did really well and especially people who did even moderately poorly are more likely to post on culpa, reporting that Gulati's arrogance is boundless or that his class is unreasonably hard.  I honestly think the best way for you to determine whether to take Musatti or Gulati is to sit in on each of their classes. \nThat being said, Gulati is probably the most entertaining, engaging, motivating professor I have had thus far.  It's a miracle at all that he is able to teach with such a busy schedule, but he also goes to great lengths to ensure we learn economics, or at the very least become invested in his class.  Whether that's by hosting faculty lunches, making sure we focus in class, or hosting review sessions, Gulati makes it easy for anyone who diligently reads and outlines the chapters, attends and understands lectures, and learns the exam format to succeed. I had no knowledge of economics going into the class and I ended up getting an A because I kept up with the readings, and asked questions when I needed help. If I can do it, anyone else can too. True, Gulati is harder than Musatti but his class isn't impossible, and the experience of his class is well worth that extra effort, in my opinion.\nIf for some reason you choose not to take Gulati, at least try to sit in on his first and last lectures. Some real eye-opening shit.\nWorkload:\nLook at other posts.\n"

I found Gulati to be an enlightening and engaging professor, but don't get me wrong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I'm not suddenly becoming an econ major because of this class. In my view, Gulati is the ideal lecturer for a class of 200 people, as his class has a ton of student participation and he's hilarious. This is the kind of class you take for the ideal Columbia lecture experience, not because you're going for a generic lecture class that is an easy A.\nIn addition to his captivating lecture style (which is almost entirely him writing on a blackboard instead of recycling old, bland PowerPoints), what distinguishes Gulati from other lecturers that I've had is how much he actually cares about teaching. As he said when he took me and 9 other students to lunch at the faculty house, he loves to teach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I totally believe it, because it shows. He wants the class to show up. He wants us to do the reading. He wants us to listen and have fun. And he wants us to learn. Gulati seems to do his best to improve his course from year to year, sometimes asking for student feedback about the course. Honestly, the fact that he cares that we are paying attention rather than sleeping or texting motivates me to work harder in the class. If the teacher is invested in the class, I'll be more invested in the class, and that's what happened here. This is a point that I think many CULPA reviews have neglected.\nShop for a good TA in this class. You can go to whichever section you choose. I had Raph Hubbard, and he was awesome.\nIt's also worth noting that we had Musatti sub for Gulati for one lecture, so I have some way to compare the two. Basically, Musatti's lecture was organized, but pretty much straight from the textbook. I was significantly less engaged in her class than in Gulati's. Musatti just isn't charismatic like Gulati is, though she's definitely a solid option for a more traditional and straightforward lecturer. Like I said, Gulati is the guy you take for the experience. And chill out about his arrogance, it's part of the Gulati experience, and it's pretty entertaining. If you can't stand him for whatever reason, just switch to Musatti.\nOne last thing, it is possible to do very well in this class, even if you have no econ experience going in. It's just a matter of reading and studying hard before each exam.\ntl;dr version: this is the one lecture class in my time at Columbia that I didn't once check my phone once during class, and I never missed a class. Take from that what you will.\nWorkload:\n-3 Short Problem Sets (2% each)\n-8 quizzes (1 dropped) (2% each)\n-1 midterm (30%)\n-1 final (50%)\nIf you keep up with the readings, it's about two 25-page chapters of the textbook per week, which can take a long or short amount of time depending on whether or not you take notes, have econ experience, etc.\nDo all of the practice exams before each midterm and final! For sure the best way to study.\n"

The lectures themselves always contain references to current events and, having never taken an economics course before, I felt much more informed about how the world works than I did before I took this class.\nGulati holds review sessions for his exams but he definitely isn't as accessible as most of the other professors I've had, partly because he spends a lot of time travelling because of his involvement in soccer. However, he isn't the most responsive to questions even right after class - before exams, for example, he'll only help you with one or two multiple choice questions that you have problems with and as for the rest, you'll have to figure them out on your own. But if there's a question or topic that a significant number of people have issues with, he will go over it. His TAs also hold office hours every week so you can always get help then if you need it. The good part is that if you do the required readings before each class, the lectures tend to clarify uncertainties you have regarding the course material. I honestly didn't find the course painfully difficult; the exams were pretty accessible.

We had Musatti substitute for one lecture, and this made me regret not shopping her class after sitting in on Gulati's first class. To be honest, I was set on Gulati's class no matter what because of what everyone else was saying about him, but I definitely should have also checked out Musatti to see which teaching style fit better for me. Musatti's lecture was clear, concise, and fun. She does have a slight accent, but it wasn't too hard to understand her - if anything, it's endearing. Back to Gulati - he's not bad and I do enjoy his lectures. Sometimes he seems to go on a tangent and I can't really follow his line of thinking - I find it more difficult to see the bigger picture with Gulati. I would just advise you to inconvenience yourself a little at the beginning of the semester by sitting in on both professors and see for yourself whom you like better because I just took the first advise I came across and ran with it and now realized that I missed a better option for me.\nBasic point: Gulati is overrated - Musatti is underrated; Gulati is a good speaker - Musatti is a good teacher. \nWorkload:\n3 problem sets\n8 pop in-class quizzes\n1 midterm\n1 final\n"

Yes, there were some cool lectures, and Gulati made me laugh quite a lot. \nGulati also inspired me to study very intensely. I read the book cover to cover, and if you asked me what's in chapter 9 part 5, I'd probably still be able to tell you. I literally did what was expected\u00e2\u20ac\u201dread the entire textbook in less than 12 weeks. I also summarized what I read and studied that for exams. By this point, his lectures were quite boring, since I'd know where he was going with them. I went to lecture only to follow his \"style\" in order to better prepare myself for the battles ahead.\nUnfortunately, Gulati's assessments, combined with classmates' clearly disproportionate backgrounds in the material, mixed into a recipe for a GPA bunkerbuster. If MPC+MPS=1, know that Gulati=GPA+bunkerbuster.\nAm I bitter that I got a bad grade I most certainly don't deserve for the amount I learned this semester? Yes. Does it help that I didn't take AP macro/micro in HS years ago or whatever? No. Should I be penalized for the above two answers? No. \nThat sums it up, folks. Don't let your pride get ahead of yourselves, and don't think that you'll become best buddies with Gulati. There was this one ass-kisser, who always piped up confidently, hands raised, and gave pretty sharp answers, but it was obvious Gulati wasn't gonna play ball with him for too long. The only plus side to this class is the several laughs you'll get because Gulati is a funny guy. And the self-entitled gleeful feeling of better-than-thou crowd mentality that is prevalent at Columbia, which I've bought out of.\nSee, I'm willing to laugh about one grade with a future interviewer, giving them the lowdown on that professor one time.

How dare any of you dare speak high of him, for the excrements of cows dare flow out of your mouths when you say he is awesome or exceeded your expectations.

Mentioning his name post-annus primeris (after my first school year, Gulati-worshippers) makes me want to regurgitate. Students boast, but his lectures are pathetic. He thinks his word is higher than God, and if you happen to doze off he will yell at you and make you feel as tiny as his children size briefs. His lectures are mediocre and nothing on his heavily-weighted exams will appear on the exams. Mostly you will hear him talk about his amazing life and his luxurious amenities, and oh yeah, actually learn economics. His exams, now, well, oh no \"godly\" professor can ever succeed in this ridiculous university without having exams as random and poorly graded by his brainless TAs. Exams will receive failing grades if they did not abide by his holy word, and many will suffer. Seriously, his TAs are terrible. Not only are they stupid and cover nothing of any practical use, but they just take the time to praise the golden calf and talk about how cool he is, and act condescending. Everyone whom I have met who has spoken to HIM has said that he is cocky, condescending, and just downright awful. Still, during class where you learn nothing you will see the slime balls swarm like locusts around his holy presence to ask him questions.\n I actually dozed off one day and had a dream that all the students in section had lined up and were taking turns to lick his ass, all while being covered in feces and yelling \"OH MY GOD, I CAN FINALLY DIE HAPPILY. OH MY GOD, HIS HOLY PRESENCE HAS LET ME LICK HIS ARSE.\" I was then awaken by him slapping my desk, and then called by him to approach his holy throne. He began yelling at me, telling me that I had been sleeping for many classes. I objected his holy word, and he responded by telling me that I was stupid for arguing in such a childlike manner. I was so humiliated and deeply repulsed by his attitude and felt like fainting, and this was only heightened when he made fun of some poor soul who gave the wrong answer and made him feel stupid. I wanted to tear for the poor soul, but quickly left only to hear him yell at me. I ran like a chicken. \nAll in all, this man is so vile, and you will hate his class. Save yourself and take the crazy swearing, hand-gesturing Italian lady Catarina Mussati, even though she sucks. Do not be taken a fool by all these comments of praise, as this man's fame in front of Columbia students is equivalent to the Kim family in North Korea of the Kardashians in America.

After reading through a lot of his CULPA reviews, I questioned whether or not he would be the lecturer people make him out to be -- he is.\nEXAMS: I did not find the exams as hard as I was expecting them to be. Perhaps this is just because knowing my lack of abilities in the area prepared me to expect the worst. They are certainly very difficult, and though I haven't taken any other equivalent here to actually compare them with, I imagine that they are much harder than the exams for other Principles classes. That said, they are very generously curved (for the midterm, the top three brackets were of the A variety, I think that was like 75%+). \nGulati provides a lot of past exams for practice for both the midterm and final (at least five). I would highly recommend doing all these for studying, it's much better than rereading every chapter of the book. However, he really only posts them online like a week before the exam so you really don't have a lot of time to work with them, especially if you have other exams going on. Also, I found the actual exams easier than the practice exams. But maybe that's just because I was more prepared for the actual.\nPERSONALITY: I personally did not find Gulati incredibly arrogant (he always talks about the guest lecturers he gets in his Global Economy class and how they're better than him, essentially), nor did I think he was especially harsh or rude in class. If you're wrong when answering a question he'll call you out on it. Most of his questions you should be able to answer if you've done the reading, so I see no problem there. He's entertaining and I found him to be very caring. A professor like him probably doesn't have to teach an intro econ class, but he does because he loves it. He also has a series of lunches for ten students each to talk and he seemed genuinely interested in each of us. He truly cares about undergrad education, and it really shows through.\nTA/LAB: My TA was nice but not particularly interesting. He was pretty boring, actually, but I felt bad about not going and there is some material covered in lab that's not covered in lecture. \nThat said, I think the question has always been whether one should take the harder but more captivating class and get probably a slightly lower grade even while putting in more work, or just take the easier, but much more boring class.\nI think the answer is the former, but it depends. I wouldn't trade the experience in for a higher grade, though the amount of work and time I put in would surely have garnered me a higher grade in a different section. If you are a prospective econ major, or taking the class for fun, to truly learn something enriching, take Gulati. If you are an engineer who needs to take this class because it's required, and you really don't want to learn the material or put in the extra time or effort, take a different section. If you go to a few of his lectures and think he's not for you, switch sections.\nDefinitely going to try and take another class with him before I graduate.\nWorkload:\n7.5% for 3 problem sets -- these aren't bad or too long, but they are so spread apart (2 before midterm, 1 after) that they are not good practice for the exams at all\n12.5% for 7 clicker pop quizzes, you can drop one -- these are stressful because they're timed and the clicker program works kind of strangely so you don't know exactly how much time you have left. most of them come at the end of the semester\n30% midterm -- microeconomics\n50% final -- macroeconomics\ngenerally a chapter of reading for each class -- I always did the reading so I can't tell you if lectures are hard to follow if you don't ... but it will prepare you a lot for exams.\n"

            "review_content": "\nLeaving all opinions of Gulati's personality aside, I am divided whether or not to recommend this class. I entered this class with the same dilemma most all face when choosing a Principles professor: dry and easy or interesting and more difficult? I choose the later because I thought of myself as the type of student that would not be able to self-motivate myself under a boring professor. Therefore, even though I knew Gulati's section would be harder, I thought I would still perform better than with an easier professor who was utterly dry. \nI am still not sure if that was the right decision to get the best results in terms of maximizing grade, amount of learning while minimizing level of effort. Unlike a previous reviewer, reading the textbook is an absolute essential to mastering the material. I don't know if he/she already had a level of econ before, but as someone who has never touched the subject before, I couldn't imagine being able to get through the class without ever reading the textbook. Sure, by the last 1/3 of the semester, I started to just skim the chapter feverishly in the half hour before class, but that procrastination showed in my quiz grades (which I consistently got 50% on). \nLectures were interesting enough that I was only tempted to fall asleep once (upon coming off an all-nighter), but I must admit myself lost if I did not read the chapter beforehand. With the number of times he has been reviewed, it becomes almost needless to say that Gulati is able to engage with the material in a level that I would not have gotten with another professor.\nAs to the exams, I think that they were somewhat fair...in the end, your grade is based on the curve so I don't think the level of difficulty of the exams really matters. However, I do think that the exams plays heavily in favor of those who naturally are more engaged in econ (in terms of current affairs). Unfortunately, I knew no econ whatsoever going into the course. Some questions were on material I doubted were ever mentioned during the course ('guy with the red wagon' really? I was difficult to even find that answer on google). I stayed fairly on top of all the material and attended all the recitations so I don't think that I would've encountered something completely foreign unless it had never been mentioned before. The grading is rather harsh but there are so many to grade, and again, the curve balances that stuff out. \nI guess I would advise that you try to get into Gulati's section and then try him out a couple times. If you don't think his lecturing style is all that or you think he's too arrogant, then quickly get out of there. Also, if you can tolerate dry material and digest the textbook all by yourself, perhaps it would be in your best interest to go with another professor. If you already know econ or keep up with econ in the news, then stick with Gulati.\nWorkload:\nfinal: 50%. midterm: 30%. quizzes: 10%. problem sets: 10%. I personally found the problem sets to be very easy, and the quizzes to be very hard (just the concept of the i-clicker and countdown timer stressed me out a lot). I think the final was graded more leniently than the midterm. I got an A-, for the record. I think the amount of effort I put in though would've gotten me an easy A with another professor. * sigh *\n"

Here are my comments: \n-I agree that his ego can seem a bit inflated at times, and he is definitely uniformly condescending in class. If he calls on you or your raise your hand and say something wrong, he will call you out on it. Because he does this to everyone though, it doesn't seem particularly mean. It probably incentivizes you to pay attention and do your work.\n-Problem sets and test questions can be a bit vague at times. This is more or less the nature of Principles of Economics I believe; you have to rely on simplified explanations for everything, and thus things get ambiguous and muddled if you think about them too much. Some of the questions are also just flat out worded poorly. For example, my TA couldn't tell me what the answers to a few quiz questions were.\n-He is a great lecturer, and though I hate to admit it, I appreciate his punctuality and insistence on pop quizzes. These traits foster incredible levels of class attendance and lend the class a good amount of energy which is augmented by Gulati's anecdotes and humor. \n-The class is run very well. Problem sets are collected and returned on time, grades are posted promptly, and he gives the full gamut of statistical parameters with regards to the midterm results. (e.g. mean, SD, range, how many students received 90 and up and what that raw score curves to, etc.)\nWorkload:\nNot too bad. There is about a chapter of reading every class that goes pretty quickly, along with a problem set that takes about 40 minutes every other week.\nThe first midterm is fine as long as you study. The final was bafflingly hard, but statistics were not released...so maybe it was just me being stupid.\n"

It ultimately depends on your learning style, but if you don't do well in a tense, large-classroom environment, take another Professor for econ. \nGrading was wildly inconsistent and inexplicable.

Seriously, if I hear one more laudatory review that places this man on a pedestal, I will shoot myself.\nOkay, so Gulati's lectures were okay, but they were far from being so amazing or invigorating or breathtaking or any other adjective of praise. There were also points in his lectures where he was not clear or thorough. What people need to do is rub their eyes and remove the blindness they have towards fairly judging this man that they lack through seeing him as an impressive soccer manager who can get them soccer tickets and fancy dinners. In terms of Gulati himself, I actually had the chance to go to one of these dinners and I was so repulsed by this man's ego and lack of modesty. Just the way he spoke and behaved were a testament to how much the brownosing and praise apparent in many of these reviews had made this man actually believe that he is above Columbia and on a pedestal of excellence and honor. I honestly do think that his lectures could have been much more to the point and they could have consisted more of topics that would appear in his obnoxious examinations. Unfortunately I feel that this man had his head much too far up his ass to actually take any critique to heart. His pomp is his greatest fault...\nNow the exams, oh the exams, oh my god I can barely escape the trauma they gave me. They consisted of random and unfair questions that were never covered within the bindings of the textbook or his lectures and were just about as random as asking what is the capital of Myanmar or what were the countries in OPEC in 1988. No one cares. Just the fact that he chose to ask us how many countries were in whatever organization or what was the name of the leader of some fiscal organization proved how cocky this man was that he didn't precisely go through his exams before administering them and check that they were fair and void of horrid questions like these.\nAll in all this man is so pompous, so conceited and so self-centered that I was surprised he did not bring a wine glass to class to collect his flatulence and smell his own ripped farts. Please people, forget the leader of whatever unknown soccer organization, and think of how deserving this man is as a highly rated professor.\nWorkload:\nTons of reading which you must do because his lectures are not all that.

He is clear, confident, and interested, a rare combination in intro classes. He knows his material ridiculously well, and doesn't have trouble answering questions about all variety of topics. He decorates the mundane aspects of introductory economics with interesting stories and significance, and doesn't just teach you concepts, but compels you to engage in critical thinking. He's an economist at heart, and in his class, you will be, too.\nQUIZZES: Gotta buy a clicker to take his quizzes, which are based on lectures and readings. Just stay up to date with the reading, which isn't too hard. They can have tricky questions, but the curve balances them out anyway.\nTESTS: Gulati gives you previous midterms and finals to go over before each test. Make sure to go over all your lecture notes, know all the terms, and go over these practice tests. In my experience in two Gulati classes, your results on the practice tests directly reflected your results on the real thing. Get an A on the practice test, and you can get an A on the real test.\n\nWorkload:\nHOMEWORK: Readings for each lecture from the textbook, which are worth doing. Occasional problem sets that are simple when working with others and utilizing the textbook.

I got an A-, and while I was aiming higher and probably would've gotten it with another teacher, I wouldn't trade my experience in Gulati's Principles for any other class. Absolutely inspiring, he demonstrates what's exciting and interesting about economics. If you're willing to put forth the work, getting in the A range is actually not difficult, given the number of people in the class who bump up the curve.

Basically, he has one of the best teaching skills of Professor at Columbia.\nHaving said that, though, I have to say that his lectures and the book are too biased towards free market capitalism. Government intervention is looked at as \"simply against economics.\" Topics like fair trade, planned economies, etc. are simply not covered. There are plenty of articles regarding the Asian fair trade literature that I have read in my Political science class, but in his class all of that literature is just \"against economics.\" Even if he disagrees with fair trade and planned economies, I feel that he has the responsibility to cover the subjects anyway in an introductory course. \nWorkload:\n5 pop quizzes (a pain), 5 problem sets; 1 of each dropped at end. 1 Midterm, graciously curved. 1 final.\n"

Lectures are always worth staying for because he makes the material relevant and funny. Much better than the alternative. Also, be sure to sign up for the lunch/dinner sessions with him, coming prepared with questions is also good. Since the class is so big, to get to know him will take a lot of extra effort outside of class, but is not impossible. \nHowever, because he doesn't always cover all the material in the lectures in sufficient depth, most of the learning will be done independently or with your TA. So choose your TA wisely i.e. go to a few TA sessions and pick the best one. I found Ben North to be a good TA if kinda arrogant and condescending. You will want a TA that knows the material very well and teaches in a clear manner rather than one who is a nice person. \nThe mid-term and final exams will rely heavily on multiple choice, so you need to know everything. Doing the past exams will help a lot since the questions are usually recycled. The final exam will have short essay type questions, which means you need to  know and explain concepts instead of simply regurgitating facts and formulae. \nNote that the large class size will not help with a curve because a lot of students will already know the material. Some guy got 97% on the mid-term and before the final was bragging about how he was going to beat his mid-term score. It will take a lot of work to get an A. \nWorkload:\n6 in-class quizzes, 5 of which count, so don't miss any classes. 5 problem sets, which aren't that had. 1 mid-term and 1 final. \n"

With that being said, I think overall he did an excellent job of covering a ton of material and making it accessible and understandable. The text book is also very good and can fill in holes Gulati leaves. Although he sometimes seems a bit harsh during class, Gulati is very nice, and sets up a ton of lunch/dinner sessions so he can get to know his students -- he learns many names by the end of the semester. He also definitely cares about his studetns and about economics and current events and does a pretty amazing job of combining wit and economics to create a class unlike any other I have taken. His class isn't always easy, but it's worth taking!\nWorkload:\nNot terrible. There are 5 problem sets, of varying difficulty, but none are terrible and they aren't graded harshly. There were 5 pop quizzes which made sure that you were keeping up with the material. Then there were a midterm and final, both of which required you to know a large amount of material, but both of which were fair (he gives like 4 practice tests for each, and there are no big surprises). A ton of material is covered in this class, so learning all of it is pretty tough, but it's interesting stuff so it's not too bad, and as I said, Gulati makes it interesting for sure.\n"

And stalk Sunil every chance you get, because he is the man.\nWorkload:\nWorkload is not too bad, problem sets every week/every other week which can be tricky at first but get easier as the semester goes on and the TAs get lazy.  Plus they are more for your own understanding than your grade, as they're worth next to nothing.  Midterm is not that hard, Final is a bitch but the curve is pretty good.\n"

This man might appear a bit cocky at first sight, but he is the nicest person ever and knows his stuff very well..  I never took econ in my life and now I'm in love with econ, partially because of my family, but a huge part has to do with Gulati.  His lectures are interesting and interactive, some stuff might be a bit boring and sleep-inducing, but for the most part, he tries hard and makes sure everyone's awake(sometimes with flying chalk).  Sure his midterm is a little picky, but if you studied the book well, you can't do that bad; I got a A- on that.  However, even if I got a not so good grade on the midterm, I will still not regret taking Gulati's class.  He's a small man that speaks volumes.  He has been to many places and knows a lot about economics and the world.  His last lecture about income distrubution exemplifies his benevolence and his charisma... I will definitely be taking more classes from him and try to know him better.. On a side note: he loves soccer and that makes up for every flaw he has, not that he really does.\nWorkload:\nBiweeklyish PSets: a hour each ; one midterm: decent; final: ?\n"

Sunil Gulati, former commisioner of Major League Soccer and an accomplished economist, makes what I think is an interesting subject phenomenonally fascinating and engaging.  He is hilarious, and will make jokes even in the most drudged of lectures.  He manages to involve most people out of a class of 300, something that I imagine is unique to large lectures.  Personally I never went to lab sections because the book and professor were so good that I was confident I knew what was going on.  Gulati was responsive to emails and questions and really knows his stuff.  There was only one annoying aspect of his class--sometimes he would spend half an hour engaging the audience in a question, such as \"if tariffs on imports are so inefficient, then why do we [the United States] have them?\" Then, after rejecting every answer he hears, Gulati will end the class or move on to something completely different.  Why will he never answer the question, or at least make some comment on it?  It seemed to be a big waste of time for me.  Thats what the lab sections are for, not lectures.  Overall though, this class was my utmost favorite and now I'm seriously considering minoring in economics.  So take this class and nominate Gulati for a teaching award.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets, midterm that you either ace or fail, and final.\n"

Gulati has a great sense of humor (although I do remember things like the other review described happening, right down to the \"Achoo!\") and the class almost never drags until the end with some of the macro stuff. As for Global Econ, it's the first time they're offering the class, and I only took it because of him. So far it seems to be pretty good, run very much like the Principles class except no discussions. (Which, BTW, were utterly useless in Principles.) He can take any subject and relate it to econ. He also encourages class discussion, but doesn't really require it. Overall, he's probably the only professor I've had here that I'd recommend to anyone else.
