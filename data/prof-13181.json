Her classes are simply brilliant and the way she teaches Lit Hum is not only passionating but also very modern. She covers intersectionality, feminism, social class and sexuality in all of her classes and allows each student to participate to the conversation. If you are looking for a more than competent lit hum professor that will make you LOVE the core, she is the right choice! \nWorkload:\n2 essays every semester. \n"
