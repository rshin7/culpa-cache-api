Rebecca was great, even the times when she made me cry. She's not easy and she's not a very nice person, but she definitely knows how to teach.\nWorkload:\nThere was about an hour and a half of work for this class a night. Not hard work, but just long.\n"

            "review_content": "\nOverall, a very easy class. If you speak Russian well and are into talking about ambiguous poetry, this is a great class to take.  The sylabus exposes you to Russian poets through their work as well as their personal biography, which Rebbecca provides every class in oral form. I reccommend this class to all my russian comrades- easy A.\nWorkload:\nOne-two poems to read for every class, three 3-5 page HNADWRITTEN papers, a ten-minute oral presentation at the end of the semester which took me ten minutes to prepare.  Honestly, I've never taken a class with such a small workload.\n"
