I don't think MM has had an original idea in the last 6 months -- based on her silly questions and blank stares until SOMEONE said SOMETHING, ANYTHING in section, she might not have had ANY ideas in the last 6 months. Her comments on our paper proposals were singularly unhelpful (in my case, she reworded the same criticism of my project that I had already expressed). She displayed less insight and understanding of the readings than we did, and most of us didn't read. Sections were often more confusing than enlightening -- each hour spent in her attendance-required discussion section is a lost hour. Eventually, most of us read, watched the sun set, thought about all the places we'd rather be, came 10, 15, 20, 40 minutes late and wished we'd skipped altogether.\nTo be charitable: it must be the case that MM is good at something. Everyone is. In MM's case, whatever it is has nothing to do with comparative politics, might have nothing to do with politics at all, and has no place leading a discussion section for an otherwise OK class. \n\nWorkload:\nFor the intro class, midterm, final and paper -- but it's sitting through section that's the real work.\n"
