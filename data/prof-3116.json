He makes sure that all the assignment problems are covered by the time you take the midterm and outlines the sections nicely during recitation. He's great in office hours and very approachable; take him if you can.\nWorkload:\n5 quizzes in recitation throughout the duration of the course\n"

Dan The Man was very effective in teaching complex concepts by putting them into layman\u00c2\u2019s terms that I could understand, I would pray to God that you get Dan as your TA.\n"
