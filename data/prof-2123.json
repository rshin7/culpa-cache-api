            "review_content": "\nProf. Yarnall did a very good job considering this was one of the first seminars he has taught at Columbia.  He is knowledgeable about the readings and very open to his students, including and esp. any personal experiences/opinions which might be relevant to the subject matter.  Our class had a great dynamic, although sometimes it resemebled more of a group therapy session than a college seminar.  He has a tendency to go on long tangents, usually delivered in monologue form for minutes on end but I think as he gets more teaching experience he will grow out of it.  His specialty is Buddhism, so be prepared to hear a lot about it.  (This isn't too much of a drawback, it provides a welcome relief from some of the more dry required readings).  Overall, great prof, great class!\nWorkload:\n100-200 pages of reading per week, courseworks posting every week, 10 page final paper.  You can get away with not doing all the reading, but you will want to do it because class discussions are fairly lively and you will get more out of the class in general.\n"
