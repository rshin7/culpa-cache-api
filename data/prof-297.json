His organization makes reviewing your notebook so much easier and it ultimately helps with the exams. He extended this course by half-hour each lecture to make time for recitation, which allowed people to come on either day depending on their progress with the homework.\nThe exams are straightforward and fair. They are also very interesting because once you do them, you feel like you've learned something so deep! If you screw up the midterm, no worries, because depending on your performance on the final, he will omit the midterm as one of his ways he formulates the grades. \nAll in all, any class Prof. Blaer teaches will be a class on my schedule! Since I'm now a grad student, I may not have a chance to have him anymore... so I spread my word of advice - if you have the chance to - take any of his courses!!\nWorkload:\n 4-5 problems per week, one midterm (may be omitted from grade), one final\n"

I've come to realize that the highest praise I can give a professor is that they make me feel like I'm back with one of my undergrad professors, and he fits that description to a T. Both in class and in his office hours it feels like I'm sitting with my undergrad advisor or one of the many other excellent professors I had in undergrad.\nExcellent professor, very approachable (3 hours of office hours a week, split over two days, and is happy to sit and explain things to you), and he seems like he wants you to succeed and isn't just looking to jam everyone into a curve. His recitation sessions are also very useful and honestly unless you're easily knocking out the problems on your own, I think you're foolish not to stay for them.\nA+\nWorkload:\n1 problem set a week, 1 midterm, 1 final\nIf you bomb the midterm and then do well on the final he won't count the midterm.\n"

He is one of the few lecturers who have mastered the fine art of being detailed and thorough while still being clear and concise.\nBlaer goes over every concept he holds you responsible for in his lectures. As other reviews have mentioned, he gives all his lectures from memory and does a much better job than most other professors who have their notes in front of them. His delivery is smooth and his pace is well measured. All his points are well connected and tend to reinforce each other. He presents a healthy mix of proofs and applications, so you not only understand the concepts but also know how to use them to solve problems.\nIn the first portion of the class, he covered all the basic classical mechanics topics from the Newtonian perspective i.e. projectile motion, momentum and angular momentum conservation, energy conservation and oscillations. In the second portion of the class, he introduced calculus of variations and langrangian mechanics, which is essentially an alternative to newtonian mechanics. He also spent a good amount of time on the two-body problem where he went over Kepler's orbits among other things. \nWorkload:\n10 problem sets or so every week, which were graded and handed back to us a week after we turned them in.\n1 midterm and 1 final, which were very fair. They tend to be application based problems, so if you review all the problems he did in class and assigned for hw, you should be fine. On top of all that, he curves to an A-!!\n"

He genuinely cares about his students and puts in much more time and effort for this class than he is required to, by teaching two recitation sections and grading all of the midterms and finals himself.  On top of that, he seems to know everything there is to know about every detail of classical mechanics and how it relates to other areas of physics, is full of interesting anecdotes about the physicists after whom the theorems we use are named, and even goes as far as to discuss the philosophical implications of each of the approaches we cover, all of which make the class much more interesting than simply reading a textbook.  On top of all that, he's always in a good mood; jolly,if you will, like santa clause.  He'll make your heart melt with his gentle, soothing explanations of the Euler-Lagrange Equations while keeping you on your toes by yelling a few carefully chosen terms with tremendous fervor.  I suppose it's something you must experience for yourself  to really appreciate.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets, but he'll typically cover (meaning give detailed solutions to) 3 of the 6 to 8 problems in the recitation sections.  If you were really lazy you could go to both of the recitations and ask him to cover different problems at each one.  Midterm is very fair, as I'm sure the final will be too.  He explains beforehand what topic(s) each problem on the exam will cover and encourages you not to memorize formulas because the ones you will need are provided.\n"

Prof. Blaer can make any and everything clear to anyone.\nThe problem set problems are well chosen so that you don't have to spend hours trying to find your way through pages of algebra.  He runs recitation sections personally, which means that even the problems were thoroughly explained.\nWhat more can I say?  He cares about his students learning the material; he teaches without notes (an incredible feat, considering the messy algebra that he goes through); he can and does explain everything.

            "review_content": "\nAlan Blaer is without question the greatest professor I have ever had in either my academic career, undergrad or postbacc.  He has a great sense of humor, and his lectures are absolutely crystal clear and fun.  Although there are numerous factors that I can't identify, I'd say that Professor Blaer does three things which make his teaching great:\n1.  He includes many of the rigorous concepts (unit vectors, the cross product and line integral -- though he never actually used the latter term in class) behind the material that other professors gloss over.  Other professors think that including such things will confuse students but don't realize that they are necessary for students' understanding.  Moreover, Professor Blaer has the talent to present such concepts so that they are absolutely clear to students.  The result is that every idea Professor Blaer presents is well-defined -- no ambiguity.\n2.  During the first few minutes of every class, Professor Blaer runs through (almost) all of the material we covered in the previous lecture, or at least everything that is a prerequisite to understand the current lecture.  He always begins this with his famous phrase \"You will recall . . .\"  The result is that many fewer students are lost due to missing or forgetting the material of the previous lecture.\n3.  He takes the different problems that are given in the book, classifies them into a handful of categories, and he shows you the method to solve each category of problem.  Therefore, for every problem that was thrown at us, we could identify its type and the method needed to solve it.  The result was that the process of problem-solving, which is often a crap shoot even in science classes, became systematic.\nThere were 2 midterms and a final.  All were certainly fair tests.  In the pre-exam review session, Professor Blaer does tell you the *type* of questions that will show up on the exam and the method of solving that type.  However, I'd say that the actual exam problems are significantly harder that the ones in the review session.  Therefore, substantial studying is still required, even with the review session.\nIf you have the opportunity to take *any* class with Professor Blaer, do not miss this opportunity.  Professor Blaer will make you love physics and love him, even if you have no initial interest in the subject.  Professor Blaer sets a very high standard for teaching that, unfortunately, other professors do not live up to.\nWorkload:\nProblem Sets (15%), 2 midterms (each 25%), Final (35%)\n"

Sure enough, you'll come back repentant and wishing you had never acted like little physics prodigies.

Also goofy-funny.  Lectures from memory.  Very compulsive when it comes to Physics (likes to stay after class and look over the notes he has left on the board).  His compulsiveness can be mistaken for arrogance, but it's really dedication.  Links past and current topics very well.  Prefers variables to numbers (unless numbers make more sense, e.g. circuits), which helps because it works to avoid losing track of the physics in a series of calculations.  Answers questions well and completely.\nThat said, he takes his sweet time doing all these wonderful things.  For every one outstanding student at Columbia there are at least two or three who are not as gifted but try to make up for it through hard work.  A Blaer class helps the latter, but not to the detriment of the great student, who just gets bumped up to an A+.\nThe curve is very high, with the median representing the cut-off between a B+ and an A-.  Close to half the class gets some sort of an A letter grade, which is ridiculous.\nOverall, if you want to understand and even enjoy Physics, learn how to approach problems efficiently, and have the grade to match, then Blaer is your man.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets (~3 hrs/wk), 2 Midterms, Final.

He defines all his terms clearly and backs up all of his explanations with helpful examples.   He's also extremely understanding of student concerns and easy to approach. The textbook is awful, but even he encourages you to ignore it sometimes.  If you're planning to take physics and see his name listed next to a course, do anything you can to get into it--you will love the decision forever.\nWorkload:\nModerate--11 weekly problem sets, 2 midterms, final.  Very fair grading.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThe man is incredible. He does not use any notes and yet his lectures flow flawlessly. I do not remember him making any mistakes while working out even the messiest of examples. It's actually quite scary how organized he is without any notes. It's as if he memorizes the lecture before teaching it. His teaching style is incredible as well because you actually look forward to coming to class and sitting in it for 2 and a half hours (Although we did get 2 5 minute breaks). The notes you take in that class can substitute a textbook (That's why the textbook is just recommended). The homeworks are hard but he makes the material so interesting that you want to spend the 15 hours every two weeks trying to get all the problems. The tests are fairly easy and he is a lenient grader with the average being an A-/B+. Although, don't expect your tests back too soon. It usually takes him about a month or so to grade the midterms, and even longer to grade the finals. (We got ! our fall grades in the middle of February!) The bottom line is that he is the BEST professor I have ever had and his class was my favorite of all the classes I have ever taken (And I'm not even a physics major)\nWorkload:\nHe'll make you earn the 4.5 points but it's definitely worth it\n"
