            "review_content": "\nHeidi maybe a good prof of grammar, but she is by no means a decent pronouncer of french. One must understand that to speak a language perfectly, pronunciation is an immensely crucial part. I would even go so far as to say that one's pronunciation is the final line between native speakers and experienced second-language french speakers. In a class such as Intermediate I, students are making or trying to make such a leap and her below-par pronunciation is stopping us from learning the correct ways of pronouncing french, or even for some, preserving their own ways of pronouncing french. Heidi, as I elaborated, does not seem to possess at all the gift of pronouncing french correctly, let alone perfectly. She struggles to enunciate from the very first class. Some of the classmates in my class spoke \"better\" french than she did. She also enjoys asking us to translate from English directly, which prevents from acquiring \"thinking in the French mindset\" which is detrimental to mastering a foreign language. \nI can tell that she is a nice lady, but she is also somewhat hard to approach, as she puts on this big smile tous les jours and it is hard to tell if she actually likes you or not. \nDo not venture to take this class just because she has a silver nugget. I have been there. \nWorkload:\ndecent, like every other french class \n"

            "review_content": "\nWhat does it take to get a gold star on this thing and why does Heidi not have one?!! Heidi is without a doubt the best professor I have ever had and a true gem of the French department at Columbia. If you have any interest in actually learning the French language from someone who is knowledgeable (read: encyclopedia of French grammar), passionate and pretty much the nicest person around, you should take her class!! She is extremely organized, definitely the fastest grader of all time, and very methodical. You can't help but improve in her class. 1202 with her is also an amazing class because it combines grammar and literature. Luckily for you she is incredible at both! So basically the point of this review is to say that you are crazy if you don't try to take a class with this professor because she is THE BEST. \nWorkload:\nLike all language courses here it is consistent throughout the semester. I would say between 4-5 r\u00c3\u00a9dactions (with revisions for a higher grade...soo do it!), quizzes on the concepts, 5 exams, 1 final and daily homework of varying length depending on the day. \n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Holst-Knudson is amazing! She really helped me improve my French, making me feel very comfortable going into Advanced Grammar and Comp. Although she does have an American accent, she makes sure to pronounce everything very clearly and accurately. She's a fair grader, and although there is a lot of homework, it's not busy work. She lets you know what to expect, and is passionate about the class. (especially the lit component) She cares about her students, which is definately a plus. She's one of the best professors I've had here! (Why doesn't she have a gold star??!?) Also, she's probably the fastest grader I've ever seen! It's not uncommon to take a quiz and see the grade by the time you get back to your room. I would definately highly recommend her. She's the best!\nWorkload:\nFive tests, five essays, a few quizzes and a final. Not that bad for a language class.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI agree with the other comments, including the one about her american accent, but I'd add a few points. \nFirst, the class itself is about learning grammar/usage to improve your reading and writing.  It can seem tedious when you're wading through the details, and there's  basically no reason to take this class unless you want to speak French at a high level one day.  After the semester ended though, I realized most of what we learned was actually pretty basic and my french had improved tremendously.\nAs for Heidi, she's a virtuoso in the classroom, unfailingly poised and engaging.  She's also cool and aloof, I don't remember a spontaneous emotion all semester.  I was annoyed by the performative aspect of her teaching, but I guess that's just her style.  As others have said, Heidi is great at explaining grammar rules and gives some of the most detailed corrections to papers I've seen.  She also posts loads of extra reading material and worksheets online, in case you want extra practice.  \nYou read a lot of literature in this class and Heidi goes even deeper by encouraging close readings and giving time to large scale themes.  This made the essays more bearable and helped class discussion along, but as the semester wore on I started to feel we were spending too much time and attention on unnecessary abstractions.  I love French literature but I don't think anyone benefited from the tortuous interpretations she dragged us through in the last part of the course, which I suspect had more to do with her ego than with us learning anything.\nGrousing aside, Heidi is the best French instructor I've had outside of France.  I didn't like her as a person and still thought she was a very good teacher, that says a lot.    \nWorkload:\nFour essays, webposts before most classes, grammar quizzes, midterm, final, class participation.  Grading was fair, not generous not harsh. \n"

Encyclopedic knowledge of the language's rules, instant recall of grammatical rules, current events, is connected to the french culture, and I hear she even does translations of french books. Very, very fair, allows corrections and amends grades w/ them. Very attentive, makes sure each student understands the who, what and whys. To top it all off, one of the most infectious and energizingly positive attitudes I've ever encountered. \n\nWorkload:\nmoderate. She does a good job of supplanting it with in class discussion, but it can seem a bit much, but well worth it. Frequent quizzes, every 2/3 weeks or so, but great great readings. A teacher for both those who are confident/experienced and just beginning.\n"

However, it turned out that we read real literature and my french writing definitly improved. Heidi is a wonderful teacher as well as incredibly nice, understanding, and energetic. She is one of those rare teachers who actually focuses on whether or not her students learn, rather than grades. She encourages in-depth discussions of the texts that involve the whole class and  makes sure everyone really understands, even if it means changing the syllabus to spend more time on a particular topic. If you have the chance, definitly take a class with her.\nWorkload:\nModerate reading (some essays and 2 short novels), every other week there is a 2-3 page composition with a chance to revise after she returns it with corrections, a few short grammar quizzes, midterm and final. \n"

            "review_content": "\nBeing a bit snobbish I was at first turned-off by her American accent. However, it was impossible not to transcend this minor qualm. Each week we would have a discussion about a particular film watched in class. Discussions forced participants to compose in French abstract conceptions about camera work and cinematic symbolism. This is quite an exceptional challenge for an intermediate conversation course. Heidi is extremely well-read and our conversations became sufficiently complex to merit this a great class.  Many people take this course to get an easy 2 points, and Heidi's only flaw was allowing these people to remain in the class for the full term; their lack of interest debased a fine course with a wonderfully brilliant teacher. \nWorkload:\nweekly posts on films viewed in class; one day of leading a class discussion based on one of the films viewed; no final anything!\n"

She spends a lot of time reviewing your writing and telling you exactly what it is that could make it better, and also if a point of question comes up in class always makes a point to go over it or find out the answer after class and e-mail it.  She is fair about grading, about re-testing, and work.  The class itself is a good class for those who are interested in french; some classes can be pretty boring as they are only reviewing grammar worksheets or talking about books (which is difficult to stay awake for if you haven't read the books; but most of the readings are worth doing if you enjoy french).  This is a great class if you care about improving your French; Heidi definitely helps with that a lot \nWorkload:\nreading a couple essays, grammar worksheets every week or so (easy if you have a good grasp of french grammar already, like ap or ib french), 5 compositions (though in our class one was dropped), a couple tests, have to read two books in french. A couple postings on readings - all in all fairly graded and not too bad if you're willing ot take the time to read in french. \n"
