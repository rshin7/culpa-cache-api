Showing to class for individual's showings are required but attendance is very lenient. I don't even remember for going half the time, but I got a good grade in the end! This is a course focusing on developing your solo choreography, which will be your last assignment. Assignments are not difficult at all - creating shapes based on images, transition from one shape into another based on a rubric, dance solo with music. It's a fun course with lots of flexibility! \nKarla is so sweet and understanding! \n\nWorkload:\nBarely any! Present your assignments, attend 2 performances, and perform your final dance solo, and you'll easily get an A! \n"

She's nuts\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlike, she'll insult you and expect you to agree with her\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut she's a damn good teacher and you will improve in her class. She'll make you very strong and really help you learn how to dance from your center\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou might want make time to stretch after class because she doesn't do much deep stretching (yoga at the beginning of class so does not count).  \nBe warned that she grades kind of irrationally. I missed four classes (for personal reasons that) in the middle of the semester, and I didn't make any of them up, but she liked me enough that she gave me an A. Likewise, I know people who never missed/made up every single class they missed who received B's. \nWorkload:\nShowing up to class; attending two professional dance performances and seeing the Dance Dept show.\n"

You improve a lot with your technique. \nThe only problem is that all of the dance majors stock up on Ballet and Modern classes  4-6 and because it is a seminar class, Karla can't give everyone an A. \nWhile I have dance training, I am not a dance major and I would be out of my comfort zone in a higher level of modern. I worked very hard and improved a lot, but only got a B. \nIt seemed unfair to me that people who were clearly better than Modern 4 would be the ones getting the As. It seems equivalent to an Native speaker taking an Intermediate level language class. After working my ass off in my Econ classes, it just seemed unfair that Dance would bring down my GPA. \nSo, keep that in mind. \nWorkload:\nnon existent\n"

You start with yoga and then work on a lot of technique-building center and acroos the floor excersises. Its not a class you take for fun-- theres no combinations really and you gotta work hard. You do improve a lot with her help but she is a litte intimidating at times. Also,shes not a very fair grader-- so watch out it might not be an asset to your GPA....and you cant pass/fail the class. Otherwise, thoroughly enjoyable class.\nWorkload:\njust coem in and dance but  you gotta work hard when in class. \n"

However, she really cares for her students.  If you take this class, your technique will improve.  She often spends too much time on exercises in the center, and this leaves little time for combinations at the end.  This serves to help with technique, so take this class if you want to improve.\nWorkload:\nn/a\n"

We begin each class with yoga-dance in silence, followed by warm-up.  The thing about her warm up is, she's slow.  But slow in a deliberate way, realizing that no matter how experienced/inexperienced you are you will get something out of the movement.  It's the fundamentals of modern dance, Karla-style.  She doesn't leave very much time to go across the floor, but I always leave sweaty and satisfied.\nWorkload:\nit's a dance class . . . \n"

Dance teachers are often either too laid back, offering little  feed back to their students or they are extremely harsh, making it difficult for the students to see past their negative comments, but Karla balances these two extremes very well.  She is firm in her teaching and constantly stresses the importance of a strong technique, but she also knows when to encourage her students and let them know how much they are improving.  I strongly recommend that you take a class with Karla, you will definitely leave her class as a stronger dancer. \n"

In her class, we learned alot about body placement and technique, while still doing a good amount of interesting choreography and across the floor work.  Though the classes can be a bit of a mix of ability levels, everyone sees dramatic improvement by the end of the semester.\nWorkload:\nClasses run an hour and a half, twice a week.\n"
