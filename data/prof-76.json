I'll admit the only reason I took the class was because I read most of the plays already being a drama-dork, and being lazy, signed up for the class to do less work. 'Twas an easy A.\nWorkload:\n2 papers, 1 midterm, 1 final. 2 off-campus theatre productions. Optional sections. Couple of recommended critical essays which she rarely discussed. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not wasting my time writing an in depth review of this class, this is just meant to serve as a warning to any future students because I feel they deserve some insight into this course before signing up and getting stuck with it. This is probably the worst course I have ever taken in anything. Ever. In four years. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even really a course, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s getting together twice a week to listen to the self-deluded, proto-feminist interpretations of Jean Howard. This was one of the single most maddening experiences of my life. Jean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are sexist at times, racist at others, and highly inappropriate for a classroom setting. Let me be clear about something: I love Shakespeare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work. I was raised on it as a child, both my parents have taught Shakespeare in their careers; I have performed his works since I was a child. While Jean Howard is no doubt accomplished in the scholarly realm she is sadly not able to grasp the humanity of the work, and it makes for a pathetic semester. You basically sit in class and listen to her read the plays, or orchestrate students to read them aloud. Seems like a waste of time if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d read it on your own like you were supposed to. There is no deep insight offered, there is no examination of context or of the poetry of the language, no character analysis. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything beyond Jean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tepid analysis of how it relates to her specific interest in, some would say unhealthy obsession with, all things sex. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an example, verbatim: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She poured poison into his ear. Ear=orifice. Orifice=vagina. She was reversing the normative gender roles and sexually assaulting him.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mind=blown. The depth of her analysis! The nuance! The psychological probing for universal truth or why the works have lasted 400 years! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing how she can reduce it all to so simple a binary! (Sarcasm.) Everything in Jean Howard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s class is representative of the vagina. EVERYTHING. \nNow, all that aside, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not a good teacher. When confronted she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incapable of engaging in a conversation about the work beyond her prepared remarks. She throws temper tantrums (and I mean at the level of a child) whenever anyone comes in even one minute late. She pounds her little fists on the podium and screams at the student. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly comical. If you want people to show up on time give them a reason to. Beyond that she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even use the English language properly. I feel like I can move past all the other failings of this course, but to be paying as much as we are to be here it is inexcusable that a professor would confuse invoked with evoked, and, worse than that, misuse the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliterally\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 CONSTANTLY. Yes, she is one of those people who use the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliterally\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 when what they are describing didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t literally occur at all. Such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will literally boil your blood.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Did you ever wonder why the dictionary now has an entry for the word \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcliterally\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 defining it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use as sometimes meaning not literal? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because people like Jean Howard kick and scream until they get to the front of the rat race and then rewrite the texts to conform to their own personal failings. You should take that as a metaphor for this course. \nYou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been warned.\n\nWorkload:\nWorkload is easy enough. Read one play per week, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think about it. One midterm where you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expected to regurgitate what Howard said and then again on a final twice as long. There are two papers, five and ten pages. Make no mistake: avoid originality at all costs. Howard wants you to write from her wacky feminist point of view. I did and I got an A on each, but other students didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fair so well and there were many complaints. Oh, and her comments will make you think she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d given it to her five year old to read. The course work isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the hard part. The hard part is sitting in class and listening to her droll commentary in her highly pretentious manner. Also listening to the other students is tough and will make you contemplate whether or not it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even worth teaching Shakespeare to people. It's sort of amazing how much time slows down when you're having to listen to some girl with a west coast valley accent give her self-absorbed interpretation of what Macbeth means. Someone should get a petition going to have Nasa look into this. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a choice quote:\n\"Like, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it, why isn't he afraid of hell..?\"\nBecause he's living in it dear, because he's living in it.\n\n"

She has a really strong passion for what she teaches and it's good because she knows all the information back and forth.  The TA's were pretty weak but that changes.  Anyway, the course is exactly what you think it is: you read amazing plays by Shakespeare and then go into them with more depth, learn about the background and context, examine key passages, etc. but not in such a way like in other english classes where you dissect comma usage as a metaphor for the author's personal struggles, but rather you discuss really important broad issues and learn their importance in the play.  Very rewarding, there was some grumbling about it being boring among other students but if you have even a fraction of the passion for the material as she does, you will be well rewarded.\nWorkload:\n3 5-page essays, midterm and final, the essays are graded pretty hard but the midterm and final are very straighforward if you study\n"

I spent time and effort on the first paper, and the TA hated it;  I wrote the second one in two hours the day before it was due, and Howard loved it.  This is NOT A HARD CLASS,   it's a class where you have to play by the instructor's rules.  With a few notable exceptions, Howard expected certain, mostly predictable interpretations of the plays, and she wasn't discreet either about them or about the passages she thought were important.\nAlmost everyone else seems to love Howard and to have loved this class - I wish I could see it, but I don't.  I genuinely hated this class that I haven't hated anything I've taken in six semesters at Columbia - especially in the English department, where I've mostly had fantastic, challenging, and rewarding experiences.\nI'm sure all the positive reviews are going to outweigh this one, but I figured it was worth another opinion.\n"

Suffice it to say that some of Prof. Howard's insights struck me as incredibly pat and cliched, but it was always an enjoyable class. She definitely didn't ruin Shakespeare for me. \nWorkload:\nTwo 5-6 page papers, which always get graded fairly stringently. In-class midterm and final which is deliberately structured to not allow you enough time. The good part is that whatever passages she quotes are ones that she's emphasized in class.

I want to second the warning from the other review of this class. \nBeware Howard mentions nothing that one couldn't pick up in spark/cliff notes. In fact, spark notes are far more comprehensive, they mention the language. Howard lectures are dedicated almost exclusively to the plot. And it really isn\u00c2\u2019t an absurd or radical notion to want to look at language in Shakespeare!!

If you are a) an English major, b) not a freshman, c) possessed of even a spark of intelligence, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  Brilliant as Professor Howard may be, I've not heard her express a single thought that I couldn't have picked up from one of Harold Bloom's collections of critical essays on Shakespeare.  Her readings of the play, which are tailored to a huge lecture class of what seems primarily to be brown-nosers, are reductive and repetitive.  I went to half of the classes, spent my time in the ones that I did go to either reading other texts or trying not to stab my classmates in the eye with a pencil, and aced the midterm on recollections from high school.  If you've never studied Shakespeare (or, frankly, the English language), this class might not be so bad.  However, even if all you've ever read is Hamlet - or if, by chance, you want to preserve your appreciation for Shakespeare, stay away.  She also has a really obnoxious policy on locking the door and kicking out people who are 30 seconds late, as well as a wardrobe composed entirely of earth tones.\nWorkload:\nNot too much, but who cares.

Professor Howard is a fantastic seminar leader, weaving seemingly random students' comments into a coherent discussion of the works.
