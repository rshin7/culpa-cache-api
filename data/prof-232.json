            "review_content": "\nBy the end of the first semester, O'Meally's section of Lit Hum had a reputation for being the easy workload section. We were never held accountable for reading the books (**no in-class quizzes**), got free pointers on our papers before turning them in again for a grade, and had no real pressure to participate in class at all.\nTo be honest, though, I felt a little gyped in the whole scheme of what I thought I was going to get out of Lit Hum because going to class and \"discussing\" the books didn't really give me any more perspective on them than I got from just reading them by myself. Class \"discussion\" consisted mainly of monologues by O'Meally on (sometimes pointless) background information for the books we read--only every 30 minutes or so would he remember to look up and say, \"Oh, does anyone have anything to add?\" The only time we really got to voice our opinions was on the days when people presented papers and we got to give them pointers, an exercise that would sometimes veer off into the direction of fascinating and valuable discussion but which was usually soon cut off by O'Meally taking control of things again.\nHe was always available and happy to talk to students during office hours, and going to office hours proved to be a *gold mine*. If you wanted help or ideas for a paper, you could literally say five words about what you were trying to do and he would launch into a half-hour musing on it, basically giving you every idea you could ever need. He also always went to great lengths to find resources that could help me, from digging through books in his office to calling his Biblical scholar friend to ask what he knew about what I was trying to argue in my paper.\nO'Meally readily admits that he has little to no expertise in the area of the books we dealt with in Lit Hum, so I felt like I didn't really get much insight from him. He is extremely smart, though, and you can tell that he LOVES to muse about literature and deep ideas, but that musing was often at the expense of us getting to hear each other's ideas and perspectives, which I felt was the most important part.\nBeware that his grading on papers may be a bit harsher than he leads you to believe by the way he praises everybody's papers in class.\nWorkload:\n- Short, easy passage analyses for passages of your choice, turned in for each book\n- 2 papers (midterm and final), presented to the class *not for a grade*, then turned in again for a grade\n- *NO* midterm exam\n- Final exam\n"

He's always smiling, quite well-dressed, and excited about teaching, about learning, and about the things he holds most dear (as far as I can tell, literature and music).  \nThe man founded the Jazz Studies department (the academic one, not the performance-oriented one) at Columbia, so if you're into music, snag a class with him, and talk to him.\nI will admit that we spent a bit too much time going over peers' papers in LitHum. However, LitHum was one of the best classes I've taken so far precisely because the time we spent critiquing each other's papers, I'm pretty sure, helped us open up and engage more in discussion, which is what the class is all about.\nYou have to really listen to what he says when he lectures, because he talks a lot and thought it is mostly very precise and interesting discourse, it can be tiring.\nGo to his office hours;  he's smart, really helpful with paper revisions, and a great conversationalist.  He has lots to talk about, especially (again) if you're into music.\nWorkload:\nNo midterm, 2 short papers, 2 long papers and a final.  The ideas behind the shorter papers can be extended into the longer papers, so less thesis-stressing.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThe course itself was great; the syllabus is varied yet relevant. The fact that this course is taught by Professor O'Meally makes it even better. One gets the immediate impression that he cares deeply about academic work. Scribbling notes with a furrowed brow when students participated (fairly infrequently), I could listen to O'Meally talk all day. Very insightful and with a great collection of anecdotes. \nOnly got feedback on one of the two papers written for the course. It was (for me) surprisingly laudatory but not especially in-depth. \nLectures intermittently included screenings of documentary or film clips which nicely complemented O'Meally's lectures. I didn't feel as though they were ever a cop-out or waste of class time, even in a small lecture course. \nWorkload:\nMidterm paper: 4 - 5 pages, a manifesto of 'What is the Harlem Renaissance?'\nFinal project: 12 - 14 pages, on a topic of your choice\nWeekly responses: two paragraphs; these weren't instituted until a month before the end of the term. I can imagine that future incarnations of this course will include weekly responses from the outset.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI just saw that American Humor is being offered again next semester and immediately opened up CULPA so that I could caution everyone NOT TO TAKE THIS AWFUL, AWFUL CLASS.\nWhen I was signing up for seminars last fall, I saw that O'Meally had a few bad reviews. Even so, I figured that a class called \"American Humor\" had to be fun enough that I could stand if the professor was a little full of himself. I was completely wrong. To begin, the syllabus is awful. Instead of reading well-known American humorists like, say, Kurt Vonnegut, Philip Roth, David Sedaris, or anyone else the phrase \"American humor\" might bring to mind, O'Meally has you read things like \"Invisible Man\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich, needless to say, is not a very funny book\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand a random novel by Mary Gordon. He was also totally unaware that some of the books he assigned this semester were out of print, making it near impossible for us to find them. O'Meally didn't send us the syllabus until the week after classes had begun (our first session was canceled because he was abroad, which shows just how little he cares about teaching), meaning that by the time we all found out how bad the syllabus was, it was too late to drop this seminar and add a new class.\nThe actual class itself is unbearably, excruciatingly boring. O'Meally begins each session by rambling for about half an hour, name-dropping and talking about Ralph Ellison, who he's done a lot of work on. He then has three or four students \"present\" two- to three-page papers they've written about that day's reading, mainly so that he can get out of teaching for the rest of our class time. We've never discussed any of the big overarching themes O'Meally named in this course's description\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinstead, we spend class nitpicking each other's work and trying not to roll our eyes too loudly. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have class from 6-8pm on Thursdays, which might be the worst possible two-hour block. Either way, I can't imagine that things would be much better even if we met in the afternoon.\nI'm so angry that one of the last courses I'll ever take at Columbia is such an utter waste. The one nice thing about this travesty is that it's barely any work\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou can contribute to discussion without doing the reading, since discussion is about other students' papers instead of the \"humor\" books themselves. Even so, spare yourself the agony of American Humor. It is without exaggeration the worst class I've taken in my four years here\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven worse than Critical Reading, Critical Writing. And Critical Reading, Critical Writing was BAD.\nWorkload:\nVery little, but it's still not worth it.\n"

He read the books along with us, and added himself into our discussions as though he were another student, although he did bring in a lot of literary criticism to introduce us to each text.  He was very personable -- our whole class fell in love with him.  It was pretty apparent he wasn't used to dealing with freshmen, but he soon got used to us and was nothing but encouraging.  His grading was usually pretty fair (although a little harsher than he made it seem it would be), and he would give good comments on essays.  Overall a good experience, although not necessarily the most in-depth lit hum class.  Oh, and he doesn't believe in tests, so there's NO MIDTERM, and he counts the final as little as possible.\nWorkload:\nTwo short (2-3pp) not-graded essays per semester to present to class, a midterm essay and a final essay (~4-5 pp), final exam (worth only 15%), NO MIDTERM!!\n"

First of all, he is too famous and too self-involved to be teaching undergraduates, because he clearly does not have time for them.  When asked when his office hours were, he replied that he wasn't sure and to please call his off-campus assistant to inquire.  He treated the class like his baby, though not in a good way:  I think for him setting up the reading list was his major accomplishment.  He thought he had come up with the canon on American humor, apparantly.  The class was dominated by several people who thought O'Meally cared about what they had to say, and he did nothing to stop that.   Also, the atmosphere was very unpleasant in that everyone was trying to one-up one another so no one would agree.  O'Meally himself could be very harsh for no reason.  All in all, I suggest avoiding this class and Professor O'Meally until he comes down to earth and realizes he isn't Toni Morrison.  \nWorkload:\n2 short papers, final 15 pager.\n"

If you do the reading, whether the class gets to it or not (and O'Meally will), listen to the songs and listen to what he has to share, there should be no end to the discussion on  our American culture, and the wayJazz dynamics reflect and inform it.

O'Meally is definitely a lecturer-discussion leader, and he blends the role well, for he knows that students are not empty vessels that he must \"fill\" with his \"knowledge.\" We're not robots dude. And O'Meally isn't the only brain in the classroom. I enjoyed the class because of the diversity of the points of view, and how well O'Meally guides students in the process of learning. Now, that's what higher learning is about: figuring out what you think and finding the answers.

Most of the time (really. most of the time), he'd play us a song he liked, and rather than explaining any of the musical elements of it, or even what it had to d with anything, he'd sit there and snap along, occasionally making a face as a player hit a high note. Don't get me wrong, he has great taste in music, and there could be worse ways to spend a morning, but come on. Our assignments were either fun but marginally relevant books (for instance, Louis Armstrong's autobiography) or pretentious essays in which someone uses every cliche about art to describe jazz (\"jazz reflects life, jazz reflects the personal life of the musician, etc.) Still, it's pretty pointless to do most of the reading, since he never gets around to talking about it (remember--the snapping), and the weekly reading respones are ungraded chances for you to become your own jazz scholar (\"jazz is life, etc\"). So, take it cause it's fun, but don't expect anything more than some fun listening and hyterical b.s-ing about art. Oh yeah, it's also easy as hell. \nWorkload:\nWeekly ungraded one page reading responses. The ta's barely read them, so i found it fun to make them really bad. and a 15 page final paper pretty much on anything you want.

Just look at the huge line every week waiting for his office hours. Prof. O'Meally can fill your ears for hours in his office, eager to discuss anything class-related or personal. If you're trying to come up with a paper topic, he can rattle off several names of texts to consult that are not mindlessly recommended but spot-on useful. This class has a fairly diverse syllabus, with authors ranging from the Harlem renaissance to Henry James and Faulkner. Some people may be disappointed that there is no direct emphasis on contemporary humor and comedic forms, but these topics are welcomed in the class discussion. Prof. O'Meally has a lot to say about the authors covered but generally keeps his remarks brief and lets the class run itself. And unlike many of his peers' anecdotes, O'Meally's are relevant to the material and above all interesting. Seminar atmosphere very laid-back: a class you'll look forward to coming to, whether you're passionate about the week's readings or just want to hang out for two hours .\nWorkload:\nSome fairly long novels and theoretical texts.
