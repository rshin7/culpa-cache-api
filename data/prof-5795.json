The class meets twice a week and Peggy remembers which muscle groups she worked out the class before and gives you a real whole-body workout by week's end. At the beginning of the semester, I had really weak core muscles and felt very sore after class. Peggy was very patient when correcting my form and made sure that I stuck to her workout plan. By the end of the semester, I had lost a lot of flab and gained much muscle\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven my parents commented and they usually don't notice when I change my physical changes (e.g. dying my hair from black to red didn't register on their radar). I have taken Pilates at studios in the city and found none that are as comprehensive and effective as this one. I highly highly recommend taking this class!\nWorkload:\n50 minutes of cardio and weight-training (taught through a Pilates lens), twice a week\n"
