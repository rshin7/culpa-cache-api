            "review_content": "\nRaquel is maybe the most interesting/bizarre/outlandishly inappropriate professor I have ever had. My Spanish really didn't improve but I learned a lot about prostitution, drug use, cannibalism, abortion, foreign aid, gay marriage and domestic violence. Her class consists of a 10 minute homework/grammar lesson and then the rest is mainly conversations in Spanish about the above topics. \nShe grades incredibly harshly but this has nothing to do with your final grade. I got mostly 60s and 70s on the essays, an 88 on the midterm and then an A in the class. Either she grades on a massive curve, or she just doesn't pay attention to numbers at all. \nI would say the key to getting on her good side is pretending like you really care. You should meet with her to discuss essays and participate like mad in class. She really is a nice person, but she is different. Definitely not your typical professor.\n\nWorkload:\nDaily home works in the workbook that you don't really need to do. 2 articles a week, highlighted and underlined. 3 essays on terrible films, graded insanely harshly. Difficult midterm and final. Not a lot of work but not an easy class.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nIf you want to know why half of these reviews worship Raquel while the other half demonize her, read on.\nRaquel does not fuck around. She wants you to do the work she assigns you, and frankly, there's not much outside of class.  Yes, she requires you to write in class essays, but I honestly don't think they really matter for your grade, regardless of what she says.  I know a girl in my class who was AWFUL at Spanish and failed every single one of those essays yet she got a B or B+ in the class because she tried during class and made it clear that she wanted to improve her Spanish.\nIf you genuinely want to get better at Spanish and have fun at the same time, this class is for you.  Everyone in our class got substantially better at Spanish because of Raquel, whether they were good or bad at Spanish to begin with.  I love Raquel and really hope she is still teaching here because not only was she an amazing teacher, but she made me question the way I think about everything, from language to social issues.  She is willing to talk about drugs or sex or whatever will interest the class and that makes it a lot of fun.\nWhile I (and everyone else in my class) loved the time we spent with Raquel, I can understand why some people don't agree with her tactics.  She does make it seem like half your grade is based on how you perform on the in-class movie essays, but I have evidence they don't, as long as you are working to improve each time.  She will also start a fight with you in Spanish and cause you to get extremely frustrated that you can't say what you want to say, while she has the entire Spanish vocabulary at her disposal.  My guess is that the students who reviewed her badly made it clear to her that they didn't want to be in her class, or that they were looking for an easy A, and she wasn't having that.  And I respect her for that.  There are definitely language teachers at Columbia who don't really push their students.\nBottom line: If you genuinely want to improve your Spanish and are willing to try during class, you want to be in Raquel's class.  She is a riot and will care about you if you care about her class.  Also, she may try to scare you out of being in her class on the first day; this is her way of weeding out the lazy students.\nBUT If you are just trying to finish the language requirement and don't really care about your level of proficiency, maybe try another instructor.\nWorkload:\nweekly assignments-- super short and easy, sometimes you hand them in, sometimes you don't (I don't think she actually checks them beyond making sure you did them). \nfour in-class essays-- graded harshly but are really there to improve your written Spanish so don't worry too much (and ask for the formula she wants before the first one!! it's very specific). \nmidterm and final-- both fair but challenging. like I said, in the end she'll make your grade whatever she wants to (based on your effort) and that will guarantee a better grade than your test grades would dictate.\n"

            "review_content": "\nDon't trust the previous reviews which try to soften the criticism of Raquel's classroom. \nHere's one of many reasons to avoid the class: \nYou are assigned four written compositions during the semester, which are written in class (Craig-Florez assigned them as homework). You have to write these compositions after watching a Spanish foreign film at home (Craig-Florez played the films in class). \nThe craziest part is that your grade on these compositions depends not only on the correctness of your grammar and spelling, but also on whether Raquel thinks your thesis is sound! Your thesis MUST tie together three things: the title of the film, a major theme of the film, and the ending of the film. No exceptions. That's complicated enough to come up with, let alone to write in Spanish, and to write during class! After the first composition, the average grade on them was between 50 and 60%. And if that wasn't frustrating enough, when our class asked for Raquel to give an example of a good thesis, she refused!\nIf someone had told me that I was basically taking a film studies class in Spanish, I would have reconsidered staying in Raquel's class.\nWorkload:\n4 movies and compositions. You must bring in two Spanish articles each week, underlining verbs and connecting words (you can skip these for a week and turn in four the next week). Each class she will give homework assignments in the red Gente book (the one without answers in the back). 10 minute class presentation (if you do it without reading any notes, you get an A-). 3 minute oral exam. Midterm and Final Exams written by the department.\n"

            "review_content": "\nRaquel is pretty crazy, but I liked her.\nIF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET INTO A SPANISH SECTION AND SHE IS THE TEACHER, DO NOT DROP IT BECAUSE OF ANY OTHER CULPA REVIEWS.\nShe definitely has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153favorites\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of some sort\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but getting on her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good side\u00e2\u20ac\u009d basically just involves enjoying her class.  This includes doing the homework, participating in class, submitting to her completely bizarre system wholeheartedly, and enjoying the language.\nMany previous reviewers have mentioned this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bizarre system\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as well, but not elaborated much.  A typical day of class can generally be expected to include: 95 seconds of reviewing homework during the very beginning of class (sometimes she finishes going over it before I can even find mine), paired conversation prompted by questions on little bits of paper, grammar lessons using either Paris Hilton, PrezBo, various drugs, sex, and Adderall as nouns, conversation based on current events, and other random things.\nI was never totally sure of what was going on because although class always seemed to be busily filled with work, we covered an amazingly tiny amount of material (this is due to the department rather than Raquel). The class was also strange because the very few things we \u00e2\u20ac\u0153learned\u00e2\u20ac\u009d were all obscure grammar lessons that nearly no one uses in real-life conversation.  At the same time, however, Raquel highly discourages learning new vocabulary as a way to improve one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s language prowess.  Instead, she encourages using the Spanish you already know to convey your thoughts, or to even change your thoughts to suit what you CAN say.\nI placed into this class as a freshman, and my Spanish was decent enough to have probably exempted from my requirement.  I was lucky to squeeze into a Spanish Intermediate II section, though, so I just decided to give it a try.  I stuck with her, so apparently I enjoyed it?  Raquel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s craziness aside, my confidence with speaking Spanish, my enjoyment of the language, and my ability to speak practically have all improved dramatically.  Take the jump.\nAlso, you have to be in the very middle to upper range of the exemption test results for her to accept you.  She rejected a fair number of people the first day because they just made it into Int II.  Also, she is terrifying the first day and half the people left.  Then the next class she was suddenly fun and hilarious.\nWorkload:\nUngraded homework (10 minutes), ungraded biweekly articles you have to find (takes 5 minutes), four movies with written compositions that are graded as much on the quality of your logical reasoning as on the quality of your Spanish (VERY FRUSTRATING; I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have been able to satisfy her on these in English because she took issue with my thought process rather than my Spanish, but it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really affect your grade).\n"

She always comes to class with a bright smile on her face and with juicy gossip and news stories from around the world. Though she is an excellent professor, she is also extremely dogmatic and critical of other people's opinions. If she disagrees with something you say, she will hound you relentlessly about it. I understand that she expects only the best from her students and that she is trying to combat the laziness with which people approach her class, but the standards that she will hold you to are entirely harsh. Her demeanor in class does not reflect the severity of her grading system nor her attitude towards you, your work, or your effort. If you tell her you forgot your book at home, she will tell you \"it's ok, it doesn't matter, whatever\" and smile, and then mercilessly punish you later for your lack of preparedness in class. Maybe I'm being a little hyperbolic, but sometimes it truly seems as if she's teaching just to get a kick out of humiliating her students. \nWorkload:\nA little bit above average...short written composition due each class, two newspaper articles marked up for verbs and connectors every other class and usually 3-7 exercises in Gente Practica. Every few weeks there is a movie to watch and a more formal in-class composition to write, in addition to a sort-of practice composition to be done at home. Midterm. Final. \n"

She is a bit eccentric and has some wierd rules, but her eccentric ways and rules only help you in the end.  Her teaching style is a bit scattered but you get used to it.  She does throw people out of the class for yawning and stretching but she only does it because she knows it's catching and pretty soon the whole class will be yawning if she doesn't outlaw it.  You will have to work in pairs for the whole class, there is no individual work in here class but it does help with your conversational skills.  I recommend the class only if you aren't a stickler for details bacuase she really doesn't have a structured class.\nWorkload:\nMidterm, final, no quizzes.

True she is eccentric, strict, and sometimes temperamental, but she is a fantastic person and a great person. She helped me whenever I needed it after class or in her office hours. As long as you are not rude and try to participate in her class she will love you and respect you. I know people warned you about yawning, which is entirely true, this semester she kicked two people out of class for yawning...and ONE OF THEM WAS ME. She talked to me after class the next day an explained how it wasn't because she thought I was rude or anything, it just has to do with class atmosphere and apparently (she didn't say this) it's really rude in Spain (where she's from) to yawn. \nAnyway, despite all of that she is SO HELPFUL, she goes over quizes with me, gets excited when any of her students do well, and she goes the extra mile to help me prepare for tests...she even printed out some helpful hints she had on studying for foreign language tests for me. \nShe is the nicest lady, always greeting her students with enthusiasm and a huge SMILE. I know she is slightly out there at times, but if you just go with the flow I'm sure you will be entertained and enjoy her class just like I did. \nIt was a 9 am class, but I was excited to go to it (almost) every day! \nWorkload:\nA fair amount. quizes every two weeks, 3 movies/compositions, midterm, final, daily homework assignments from workbook that we don't turn in.

The daily oral exercises are good-intentioned, I suppose, but essentially useless. You can have a 97 quiz average, but if you yawn or stretch or turn your page too loudly during a test (true story) she'll dock your participation grade and call you an inconsiderate student. It's not worth fighting with her either, because she'll just tell you to switch sections of you have that much of a problem.\nShe broke her hand three-quarters of the way through the semester, and when the grad student who finished the semester came, he was basically appalled by how little people had grasped the material Raquel had 'taught.'\nBasically, if you're not looking to have to fight for the grade you deserve, steer clear.\nWorkload:\nNot bad, 5-10 workbook exercises a night, seven or so quizzes, four films, a midterm and a final.\n"

She does not make it a point to help her students even when they express serious interest in getting help. She, many times, shews them away once class ended. Once, she told a student in the staircase of Hamilton, \"Go ask your classmates. Don't bother me with your questions.\"\n2. She creates an unhealthy atmosphere not conducive to learning. This is because she harps on the students for doing regular things, like coughing, yawning, or stretching. And I am not lying. You can ask anyone who took her class. She has kicked people out for stretching! And the person I witnessed she kicked out he stretched once! She even got mad at a kid for \"raising his hand too many times.\" Her punishments for students make them feel timid and therefore less apt to try to learn since they feel like she will punish them for trying. She is absolutely illogical and confusing.\nWorkload:\nDecent workload. An hour or two of homework a night. It actually was not too bad.

She in unable to convey the basic concepts of elementary Spanish in a clear and direct manner. She just whizzes from one chapter to another and you better sleep with your textbook and prepare to teach yourself.\nAbsences: You are only allowed to have 3 unexcused absences throughout the entire semester, for a class that meets everyday of the week, and the only way to get an absence excused is with a written note, not an email or phone call. It has to be a written note. \nHomework: Homework is gone over at the beginning of each class and Raquel sits there, with her pen and attendance book, calling on students at random. If you don't have the homework she makes a little mark in her book and she is not subtle in doing this either.\nStretching/Yawning: If you stretch or yawn in Raquel\u00c2\u2019s class then she may/will kick you out. One freshman this semester was kicked out a few times for this and while it seems ridiculous, as yawning is not a reflection upon Raquel or her class, Raquel will not hesitate to lash out at you with a remark like: \"This is my work and I don't come to your work and yawn do I? If you want to do that then go to your room.\"\nClass Exercises: Even though the class was only Elementary Spanish 1 you could not speak any English at all. You are expected to learn the vocabulary outside of class and most of the class time is spent working in groups on exercises that Raquel speeds through, one after the other, never really explaining anything. She passes out more paper and spends more time talking about sex and other nonsense than she actually teaches.\nOverall: While Raquel is not a mean person, her class was unbearable. Most of the time you are subjected to her mood swing of the day and you never know what to expect from her. She holds your grade above your head and makes it known if you are one of her favorites or not. As long as she has the most control, is the funniest, the loudest, and the most shocking then everything is alright. If you dare to EVER challenge her then your life will be miserable.\nI WOULD NOT RECOMMEND RAQUEL AS A TEACHER, AT LEAST NOT AT THE ELEMENTARY SPANISH I LEVEL. SHE IS TEMPERMENTAL, UNPROFESSIONAL, AND HER CLASS IS A PAIN TO GET THROUGH ON MOST DAYS.\nWorkload:\nThe class meets everyday of the week with homework assigned for each night, including the weekends. Three compositions, quizzes on each chapter covered (7), lab manuals for each chapter due the day of the quiz (7), a midterm exam, oral final exam, and written final exam.\n"

Two semesters are compressed into one \u00c2\u2013 all frills (vocabulary lessons, games etc) have been removed.  Essentially this is Spanish at its most straightforward.  Little emphasis is put on vocabulary or Spanish culture.  Heavy emphasis is put on the grammatical concepts, speaking, and listening skills.  The pace of the class is very fast -- we covered about two chapters a week.  If you have no previous Spanish experience, this class may not be the best fit.  For those who have studied spanish (or latin), and want a fast-paced yet thorough review, this class is a good option -- especially because it only meets 3 days a week (and fridays aren't one of them).\nYou will be teaching the grammatical concepts to yourself outside of class.  Class-time is for practicing those concepts.  Much of the work in done in pairs and Raquel is simply there to correct you.  Don't expect Raquel to teach you the fine points of Spanish grammar -- while she will do her best to clarify things if asked, all of the learning will come from reading the book (it's a fairly good book, although the content can be scattered around).\nDon\u00c2\u2019t be scared away in the first week.  Raquel can seem very intimidating and her teaching style comes across as very narrow minded: \"don't ask me how to say a word in Spanish, just choose a different word.\"  This is simply to shrink the class down, and weed out the people who won\u00c2\u2019t be able to keep up.  Our class had only 9 or 10 people, and it was wonderful.  If you have a choice, take the later section.  Because it's after the working day ends, you'll get to meet some ridiculously interesting people.\nRaquel is fun, but slightly eccentric (she has many interesting conspiracy theories).

            "review_content": "\nSpanish was one of my favorite classes this past semester, in no small part because of Raquel.  While it is true that she expects you to memorize most of the finer points of Spanish grammar and new vocabulary words on your own at home, she makes sure that you use the grammar and vocab. in  in-class exercises, thus ensuring loads of class participation.    The class is interactive, and Raquel does not object to digressions in the conversation, so long as they are in Spanish.  I found this method of learning Spanish far more interesting than sitting in the class room and being lectured at about grammar rules.\nWorkload:\nThree (fairly easy) in-class essays on some interesting Spanish films, a midterm, final, lots of quizzes, and LOADS of homework in the workbook-- although it all starts to feel less overwhelming once you get into the rhythem of the work.\n"

            "review_content": "\nWell, I don't agree with those students who say that she is an awful teacher.  I will admit that she is not the greatest Spanish teacher in the world, but she is one of the best in the Columbia Spanish Department.  Sadly, I have found that Columbia is greatly lacking in the Spanish Department on a whole and you are not going to find your foreign language experience here all that stimulating.  Do not cast off Raquel as a poor teacher; she has some very positive points about her teaching style.  She encourages/forces Spanish conversation in class which helps a tremendous amount (and can admittedly be a struggle for those who have trouble listening).  Also, she is a very nice, interesting, and funny professor who makes what could otherwise be an unbearable experience actually fun.  She can explain rules, and exceptions, much more clearly than other professors that I have had.  She really doesn't seem to care about grades at all and rather just wants to make sure that you understand her language and culture.\nWorkload:\nLots of workbook exercises, lots of quizzes, lots of listening, lots of compositions.  This class is overall lots of work.  If you do it all, no matter how well you do it, you are guaranteed to get a decent grade.  She says her grades conform to a strict percentage layout set by the department, but trust me, she just gives you what she thinks you deserve.\n"

Don't mind the comments of the first year students taking Spanish 101 with her either b/c they are still fascinated with the idea of being here at Columbia. \nI'm a Spanish major and had to take this class, her section and although I received an A, I still regret it. She was VERY rude to students who didn't agree with what she was \"explaining.\" Half of the time she was asking us how to pronounce words in English. Didn't care how much we learned. I am a senior with bad experiences with professors, but she is the worst (quality wise) that i've had in my four years. So DON'T. \nWorkload:\nShe was more interested in the details of the homework and it being late, than in what she gave for homework. \n"

You are expected to teach yourself and the beginning of the semester goes quickly. I had taken one semester before and found the pace of the class to be perfect for me. The beginning was review and the rest of the semester went at a slower pace. Raquel is very nice and I enjoyed the class but some students complained because we were expected to learn from the hw and the book (not from Raquel). In class we reviewed the hw and did numerous activities using what we had already learned but Raquel doesn't lecture. I struggle greatly with languages and I still managed to keep up just fine. I'd take a class from Raquel again.\nWorkload:\nQuizzes every few weeks (she drops the lowest grade), midterm, final, 2 reviews in spanish of spanish movies (even easier than it sounds), one final project that she doesn't really grade, daily HW not picked up but reviewed in class\n"

            "review_content": "\nRaquel seems very intent upon  using repetition as a method of  teaching concepts. This should be  taken as either a suggestion or a  warning depending on the individual.  For me, it didn't help as much as I  would have liked because the  repetitive exercises centered around  grammatical structure, which didn't  seem to need as much attention as  vocabulary building. As a result,  problems occured on her tests  because she tends to use a lot of  unfamiliar vocabulary in subjective  situations which makes thourough,  and even correct answers difficult to  produce at times. However, she is  enthusiastic, so the class, however  helpful or not, is never a snoozfest.\nWorkload:\nHomework is about average for a  1201 level course and really only  takes as much time as you feel you  need to put into it to grasp the  material. The tests are either easy or  difficult depending on whether you're  there for an easy A, or because you  just got out of 1102.\n"
