            "review_content": "\nThough she slowly figured out what teaching a class entails, her dry, teenager-like sardonic approach to the course left our class literally crying from frustration and complaining about her methods frequently outside of class (and in a cathartic couple of minutes when she asked for criticism, inside of class too).  Was this assignment supposed to be 50 pages?  3?  It was never really clear.\nShe wouldn't specify what her assignments entailed, and rarely responded to emails, so the disparity in what people turned in was always drastic.  She always exuded a calm snarky confidence, think Meryl in Devil Wears Prada, though when she is dealing with upset students it becomes unnerving and inappropriate.  Once, she even remarked that the general bewilderment and anxiety seemed to be a \"theme of the class.\"  She never articulated what was expected of us, or her exact grading system.  She would assign large creative projects, and then only provide enough time for a couple people in the class to present the fruits of their tedious labor.  \nAnd though she occasionally dished out little directing tips, her methods were far from didactic.  She would dismiss scenes as \"Gap ads\" or \"like watching two people with Asbergers,\" with the actors in the room.\nUnless you enjoy stressful pain, do not take a class with Alice.\nWorkload:\nLots of random painstaking assignments that you'll never really know if you did well on or not until you see your grade on SSOL.\n"
