            "review_content": "\nThis class began with Professor Hall seeming kind of timid and awkward, but after the first few moments of the first class, you realize that he really cares about the class discussions and wants you to participate. When people do the reading, and especially when you do the reading, the class is the most engaging.  But on off days, it can be grueling.\nThe subject matter is really interesting for the most part, but there are readings and posts on Courseworks for every class so it can be a bit dense.\nAll in all, Hall is a young guy, and sometimes really funny in a nerdy kind of way. He has to assert himself as a young teacher, though, or at least that's my opinion, so the workload is surprisingly vast and he's not the easiest grader. I took it to fulfill my Ethics and Values requirement assuming that I would get an easy A and it's sort of an interesting sounding class, but it ended up taking up a lot of my time, and I'm not positive that I'm going to get an A...which is fine. Definitely worth it if you're interested in the subject though.\nWorkload:\nreadings and posts for every class (sometimes he'll announce a lecture outside of class relating to the class and if you go and post about it, it counts for 3 posts. Definitely take advantage of those opportunities even if you only go for a little-and post about the little information you go)\n2 papers (2nd one counts more than the 1st)\nmidterm and final\n(He gives you questions that you prepare the answers for and then only 5/10 are on the test. Do it in a group!!!)\n"
