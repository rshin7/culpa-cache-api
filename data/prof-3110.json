            "review_content": "\nIf you get Carlos, count yourself lucky.  Not only is he funny, easy going and an adept teacher moreover, he likes his students and understands we work hard.  That's the pc way of saying he doesn't kill you with busy work.  Great class to actually practice speaking.  He won't make fun of miserable accents or look down at you as you fumble the conjugations outloud for the first time.  If your first year left you feeling like a spanish retard, this is a great class to review the grammar and get comfortable using it.  I highly recommend him.\nWorkload:\nIt really depends on how well you learned grammar.  The class itself is just review.  If you learned well, it is easy.  If not, you will have to discipline yourself to study hard because the class goes through a chapter a week.  Not a lot of homework but if you didn't study, it'll catch up with you on the tests. \n"
