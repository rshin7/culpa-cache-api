            "review_content": "\njI'll cut down the redundancy and agree that most of the previous reviewers for Rosenberg have hit the nail on the head regarding his teaching style in class. But seriously - how many other professors will you encounter have such a deep understanding and appreciation of the classics, arts, and literature? After all, you're being taught by the dude who wrote John Ruskin's biography and turned his analysis of Tennyson's \"Idylls of the Kings\" into something akin to a religious text. Yeah, he repeats himself from time to time. Yeah, he does pick and choose favorites (and in my experience, he seems to favor the ladies more - I guess chivalry ain't dead in Rosenberg's turf). Yeah, he doesn't like it when people don't do the reading (but thankfully, he never gave our class pop quizzes. But if you are one of the fortunate freshman to have been placed in his section, I urge you to give Rosenberg a chance. He'll definitely challenge, if not change, your perspective from the Iliad to the Bible.\nGradewise - I felt he was very generous with my final grade. I ****ing flipped out when I got my first midterm back (somewhere in the B+ range, which nearly gave this pre-med a heart attack). But as the semester dragged on, I appreciated more and more his \"fluid\" grading style. A lot of Lit Hum teachers will tell their classes that this midterm/paper/quiz/final/etc is worth a certain percentage of your grade, which in my opinion, can actually stress out and discourage a student even more especially if they have done poorly on any one of the assignments. But because Rosenberg (much to the class's chagrin) always said \"I don't know how much each assignment is worth,\" we basically tried our best on everything, from those random pain-in-the-rear pop timed writes to our first (and last) take-home paper of the year. And I feel that in the end, he evaluates your work and your progress as a whole. So if you happen to be that student who struggles with writing (or just don't give a rat's ass about Diomedes or Pericles or Harpagus), yet you consistently participate in class and try to follow his instructions on the timed writes, you'll be on your knees singing Hallelujah once your final grade comes out (right in the middle of your other finals :) haha).\nAs much as I enjoyed Rosenberg's class and teaching style, what I didn't appreciate was the fact that he didn't prepare us AT ALL for the IDs portion of the final exam. What I recommend is highlighting and marking any important quote (aka. quotes and passages that Rosenberg specifically discusses in class) so that you'll at least have something to review for come finals. Also, talk to your friends in other classes - chances are, their more \"normal\" Lit Hum teachers will have provided practice passage IDs that you can look at/borrow/test yourself to prepare for the final. Rosenberg's midterm, after all, didn't contain any IDs. \nSo I apologize for this long review - it turned out to be a little redundant, I'm afraid. But if you are that frightened and uncertain freshman who turned to CULPA as soon as you found out your Lit Hum instructor was JDR, I do hope I've assuaged your concerns, if only a little. Good luck! \nWorkload:\nStandard Lit Hum reading. For our class, he threw in extra books of the Bible (portions of Exodus and Romans that honestly didn't take long to read). Keep up with the readings - he gave us a pop timed write at least once every week or so. \nMidterm: 3 essay questions (no IDs)\n1 big essay at the end of the semester (make sure you do well on this one!)\nStandard Lit Hum final (no clue how he grades it)\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Rosenberg is an old school literature professor. Think \"stereotypical Ivy League\".  While some of what he says/emphasizes is a little trite/repetitive (he often repeats himself from class to class to class...), other points that he has about the texts are extremely insightful.  He whips through the required readings at the speed of light, so be prepared.  \nIf you want to do well in the class, be sure to dominate the discussions of the books early in the semester; later on, Rosenberg will primarily rely on those people who contributed to class discussions a lot in the beginning of the semester. One of Rosenberg's pet peeves is people not reading the assigned readings. If you didn't read the book, either skip class, Sparknote, or just sit/take notes/be quiet, because if he catches you, he will not hesitate to harshly reprimand you in front of the class. If he catches any one person in the class who has not read the book, he'll start pop quizzes. (and will institute them for the rest of the semester faithfully, which is annoying) \n\nWorkload:\nWorkload is reading heavy, but differs from book to book. Don't get behind on the readings, because if you do, you'll have a hard time playing catch up with the amount of reading that he expects you to get done. Good news is that Prof. Rosenberg does not assign as many essays as most other Lit Hum profs do. \nPer semester: 1 in-class essay, 1 in-class midterm (3 essay questions), 1 six-page paper (take home). Easy A as long as you keep up with the readings and participate in class to some degree.\n"

            "review_content": "\n       Professor Rosenberg is a good -- not great --  teacher. As many of you may have noticed, the end of the semester tends to bring a certain nostalgia, which I think many of the reviewers under me may have been suffering from. Professor Rosenberg is most assuredly brilliant, and his incredibly insightful comments counted quite a bit towards my enjoyment of the class. But at 9 in the morning, his slow and somewhat monotonic speech did not help my 4-hours-of-sleep induced somnolence. He is, however, *extremely* nice, and probably the sharpest 83 year old I have ever met. He is also a no-bullshit kind of guy -- if you give him one of those vague, I-haven't-read-the-book-so-I'm-just-gonna-make-some-shit-up answers, he will shoot you down for it, just like you deserve.\n       Another (previously mentioned) issue with his class is that the essay and test questions tend to be extremely simple. He would ask the kind of questions that were apparent from the second you read the book (\"What is the significance of blindness in Oedipus Rex?\"). While this may sound like a good thing (simple equals easy, after all), It actually made things more difficult, because you find yourself struggling to give a meaningful answer when the obvious (and clearly oft-repeated) one is looming so large. \n       The trick to doing well in Professor Rosenberg's class is to show him early on -- via class participation -- that you are a smart and intelligent person who deserved to get into Columbia. If you do, he will respect you for it, and that will reflect in your grades. If you don't, well, you will probably be on here 3 months later writing a review like the May 2005 one. \nWorkload:\nNumber of essays vary, usually 1-3, but they are all graded very easily. The midterm and final are essentially just in-class essays with a few identifications thrown in. The pop-quizzes suck but if you actually do the reading, then you should be fine. Speaking of which: do the reading. Seriously. Rosenberg will hunt you down if you don't.\n"

Even people who seem awe-struck by him try to warn you that certain current Columbians are a terrible match with JDR. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no question of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153professor ability.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d John D. Rosenberg is one of the great minds of the last century. The match between JDR and you is what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at issue here. You got into Hogwarts and\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthough the odds were 57 to 1 against you\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey assigned you to Albus Dumbledore himself. Infinitely experienced, quiet, faint British accent from BA and MA at Cambridge, deadpan wit, so brilliant he can be a little frightening. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Harry Potter, your life is about to change. But if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re like the poor soul in the May 2005 review below who writes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153definitly,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153essey\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in trouble. Unless you have already had a superb education at an elite secondary school\u00e2\u20ac\u201drun! Trying to follow JDR you'll only be confused and bored. JDR is 82 or 83. He has taught Lit Hum nearly 50 years. Columbia used to be as proud to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exclusive\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as it now is to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inclusive.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  For the first 30 years, JDR could assume his students had an education which is now given only by elite institutions. Notice the remarks about his digressions or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ramblings\u00e2\u20ac\u009d below? They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the main point of the lectures. Others work on only one piece of the puzzle. JDR shows you how all the pieces are related in one big picture.  Discussing Dante, he might abruptly show you the connections to painting or sculpture, using Raphael or Donatello.  JDR can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t guess that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just thinking, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d we get to Ninja turtles?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be confused, then bored. I can't prove it, but I hear that if you ever tell your advisor that a professor's vocabulary and references are so hard to follow, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re dreaming of dropping out of Columbia, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll transfer you fast to some very bright 25 year old grad student who starts the class, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What you know about Dante? I know all about Dante!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall asleep and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll free up a seat for someone whose life can be transformed by JDR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lectures; as mine was. In every course after this a specialist will show you one piece of the puzzle. Only a John D. Rosenberg can show you the whole picture. Go see him in the office, and try out all your ideas. If he says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I like it, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never heard anybody say that. Good job\u00e2\u20ac\u009d --you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve struck gold!

He is very nice and considerate, which is sometimes a hinderance to the class.

He talks extremely slowly and asks very basic questions on texts that could be explored much further. The workload is fair but his grading is sometimes difficult to understand.

He welcomed our class of freshmen with genuine warmth, compassion, and humor, providing invaluable insight into every single text we read. Having taught at Columbia for over 40 years, it was inspiring that he still approached the texts with such enthusiasm, and never once felt the need to boost his ego by belittling his students, as is often the case with very accomplished professors. I also found it particularly remarkable that he never once rambled, despite being very advanced in his years. Every word seemed carefully thought out and aptly selected, which is a rarity in professors. He is the standard to which I hold all subsequent core instructors. He made me want to get out of bed for our 9 AM class every single day.\nWorkload:\nLight.

Very deliberate and soft-spoken with this quiet manner and affectionate treatment of each poem.

I still can't tell if his drawl was British or Southern.  I'm sure most students were afraid to ask questions so as not to appear uninformed or waste his time, but he'll happily field any question in class and even more so in his generous office hours.  He really wants you to interact more or ask more detailed questions in class and office hours.  Meeting with him will definitely help your participation and probably your grade.  The only time he showed some frustration or disappointment was when we couldn't pick up the Hamlet and Shakespearean references in Tennyson.  He dryly said, \"Well, kiddies, it's from Hamlet.\"  But in all fairness, I guess we deserved that.\nWorkload:\nTwo short essays each comparing/contrasting an earlier draft of a poem with its final revision by the poet.

For the term paper, he DOES NOT want some research dissertation with myriad sources; he basically wants a longer close reading of one or two poems, so you're basically doing the same thing as the first two essays.  I don't know what the other grades were like, but as long as you use textual support from the poem in question and have a vision of the poem's sentiment, you'll probably get an A.  Most of the readings are small, except for things like Wordsworth's \"Preludes\" or Tennyson's \"In Memoriam\" which are over a hundred pages each and he expects you to have fully read them by class.\n"

He's also a stickler for grammar and spelling, which stinks because most of his asignments are in-class. When I met with him to discuss my papers he was very unhelpful.

            "review_content": "\nRosenberg does read much of his lectures off stacks of yellowing looseleaf, but my God, I want to get my hands on them and send them to a publisher. I loved this class. I walked in every day and for a glorious hour and fifteen minutes let that mellifluous and undefinable accent stoke my interest in Victorian literature and in the sheer joy of language. Rosenberg's relish for language comes out in his obsessive close readings, in those lectures which ought to be published essays, and in his constant asides which betray an incredible wealth of knowledge and a droll, understated sense of humor. The class covers essays, social criticism, and poetry, rather than the usual novels, and very quickly does away with the widely accepted view of all Victorians as repressed hypocrites. (With that out of the way, they become much more interesting.) One downside to the class: Rosenberg relies almost entirely on office hours to get to know his students, so go or he won't know you from The Lady of Shalott. But even if you don't get chummy with him (and I didn't get the chance, since I had a class during his office hours), the Victorian Imagination is a marvelous, intellectually stimulating, enjoyable experience. \nWorkload:\nFor all: reading assignments that vary from a few poems to forty pages of dense essay (be sure to check the length of each assignment), final exam comprising four short essays on various authors and works. For undergrads: one 3-5 page paper comparing two drafts of a Tennyson poem, one 10-15 page term paper on any work or piece of a work. For graduate students: term paper only, with the option of relating it to your field of study. \n"

A Jewish Santa Claus complete with the slight belly. His beautiful monotone voice is a cross between genteel southern and an affected british accent. This is the kind of college professor portrayed in movies. Super nice. Super well-read. Super insight. The sort that recites sonnets in class to make a point. Expects class discussions but rude people will sleep. Arrive on time out of respect to the man. \nWorkload:\n1 in class paper. 1 midterm. 1 take home essay. 1 final. 3 pop quizes - easy read the book, and expect it on Dante and Lear. I would say fair grader - leaning toward easy. The grandpa rule - the older they are the easier they grade. If you read anything it has to be Lear, or at least watch the movie. I would suggest reading Lear, Inferno, parts of Aeneid, parts of Montaigne, Pride and Prejudice, and Crime and Punishment. He is an english professor so he expects good grammar and good writing. \n"

The syllabus is engaging, and Prof Rosenberg, although he can be overly slow and laid-back at times, is pleasant to listen to. His lectures vary in quality, but he always manages to adequately communicate the important points in the reading, particularly when closely analyzing texts. Furthermore, his sense of humor and aesthetic perceptiveness make each class very enjoyable, even if it may not be tremendously stimulating.\nWorkload:\n1 short paper, 1 final 10-15 page paper, and a final.\n"

But within a few weeks I found that it was my favorite class- he ruthlessly emphasizes close reading and spends entire class sessions on a few verses of Tennyson or a paragraph of Ruskin. I learned transferrable skills: what English major doesn't need to close read, while in other English classes I just learned broad thematic and forgettable material about American national identity or imperialism or whatever. It can be slow though, there is little class participation and unless you hit up his office hours he won't know your name. Full of genuine insights and sardonic little comments. I love this class...once I gutted through the first few weeks. \nWorkload:\nLots of reading, although you can get away with not doing it. One five page paper and a final ten page paper. Lucky me ; )\n"
