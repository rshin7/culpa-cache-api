She's extremely personable and understanding of the things that come up in a student's life.  Her lectures are interesting and does a wonderful job of transcending chronology to draw connectinos between styles done hundreds of years apart and she incorporates students' opinions and ideas so it's not just an hour and a half of her voice.\nWorkload:\n2 5 page papers, one short presentation on reading to the class, reading is manageable though not easy, midterm and final\n"
