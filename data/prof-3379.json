She is always available to for the students and seems generally interested in helping them improve in their ability to write.  She is very friendly.  She is always willing to read a student's work and to comment on it before it is handed in.  She is not an easy grader.  You have to work for a good grade.  I had to revise each paper over and over again before I received decent grades on them.\nWorkload:\nIt's the usual UWriting load.  She pushes back deadlines if the class seems to be struggling with the essays.  She also allows rewrites.  Some of the readings aren't that interesting but they're bearable.\n"
