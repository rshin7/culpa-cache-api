But be warned, his grading is very stringent and stingy. So be prepared to work hard for your A if that's your aim.\nOtherwise, if you're thinking of improving your writing, I would most  certainly recommend this class to all.\n"

The class basically consists of reading various articles and discussing them in class. You write the standard four essays, and two of your essays get workshopped in class (people read the essays at home and then give you comments in class). That's really all there is to it. Great guy, smart, no complaints whatsoever.\nWorkload:\nPretty light. Just the four main essays. A few \"exercises\" that you write on some of the articles (ungraded).\n"

His greatest flaw is controlling cnversation in class, sometimes, my own fault included, conversation could easily get sidetraked. But for a UW teacher, and the horrors i have heard from my friends, Antoly is one of the few at the top of a short list of goo UW proffesors. Feel lucky if you get him\nWorkload:\nThe normal UW workload, reading and writing, with about 3 to 4 big papers making up most of the grade\n"

He's approachable, fair, and insightful.\nIf you see him on your schedule list, take him.\nWorkload:\nWhat the department mandates: two 1500-2000 word essays and a 2500-3000 word research paper, plus a 1200-1500 word retrospective essay that was cancelled because of the TA strike\nhe can tell when you're bsing and when you really worked on the paper, and will grade accordingly. even though its just a freshman writing class, even if you're a future english major its still work, but as long as you do it you should be all right.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nAnatoly is most definitely a grad student--he comes in dressed in a sort of bomber jacket and jeans--but he does know his stuff.  Really mellow, speaks sort of slowly, and has a slightly annoying habit of letting his voice drop towards the end of his sentences.  But he will really push you to be a good writer if you take his suggestions.  Extremely helpful and prompt, always returned papers very quickly.  The main problem in this class was that we had some engineers who would complain in class about the fact that they have to take a writing class.  Anatoly stuck with it and kept class discussions pretty focused despite the interruptions.  Overall, a good teacher to have for your writing requirement.\nWorkload:\nThree 1500 word papers, and one larger 2500 word paper.  In the first half of the semester we also had 600-word ungraded exercises on each piece we read which was time-consuming.  No midterm, no final.\n"
