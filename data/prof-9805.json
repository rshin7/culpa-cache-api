This class is as much about Islamic Law as it is about the Western Orientalist system, and you will leave class blown away every week. Your perception of the world will change entirely. \nHe is also extremely available and kind to his students. And incredibly funny!\nWorkload:\nDo the readings (around 100 pages a week, sometimes more or less) they're interesting, weekly response, end paper, easy end exam.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Hallaq's class was a pleasure.  Instead of trying to teach Indian texts, which are outside his speciality, he taught only Islamic texts, which gave an appreciated focus to the class.  Just imagine a professor talking about Indian epics when they've never studied a word of Sanskrit.\nIn class discussions, he struck me as the most intellectually honest professor I've met at Columbia.  He is himself from a Christian family, but is obviously very invested in the subject of Islamic law, and he did not sidestep, evade, or otherwise shut down students who came to the class with an anti-Islamic or atheist position.  Some discussions began with comments like, \"Do you think the Quranic injunctions against non-Muslims are barbaric and untenable in the modern world?\" Hallaq's responses always had a definite ideological underpinning, but he was respectful of students and engaged with their often difficult questions in a way that impressed me.  We were fortunate to have some genuine ideological diversity in the class, and the professor's moderation of the class discussions made it one of my two favorite classes so far at Columbia.\nMy only significant issue with the class was the length of some of the readings.  I was ready to do a lot of reading for the seminar, but on two different weeks we were assigned 500ish-page medieval Islamic scientific treatises (the Muqaddimah and Travels of ibn Batutta).  These were murderous reads.  I would have preferred to have read selections or have the books read over two weeks.\nIf you take the class, expect an intense workload.  Professor Hallaq is strict about deadlines and will read and critically evaluate everything you write for the class.  He sent a number of weekly responses back to students as being inadequate.  It's definitely worth it, but don't take the class if you're going to be overworked that semester and can't devote serious effort to the readings and essays.\nWorkload:\n200-500 pages of reading per week with a two page response, with each student presenting a weekly reading once in the semester and sending an 800-1000 page response.  Two 2500-word essays.  Responses will be critically evaluated.\n"

            "review_content": "\nBefore taking this class I was under the impression that it is super hard, but it was not. Prof. Hallaq is such a great Professor. So organized, knowledgeable, funny, and not intimidating. He was very friendly and ready to answer any questions. The class make-up was interesting. Not as many Muslims as an earlier review indicated, but there were definitely a lot of  JTS kids. I precisely remember one kid who always asked questions very offensive to Muslim Americans in particular, but who gives a flying fig newton? Very great class. Grading of the final paper was very easy. I got an A and my friend got an A+-- we never read or did anything besides the presentation \nWorkload:\nAbout a 100 pages of reading a week. Sometimes he randomly calls on people to summarize the reading. I was never called on Presentation, really easy particularly if you have some idea about your reading \nFinal paper easily graded, I wrote about something random. I don't think it even related to Shar'ia law for the most part. haha\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nLike the review below said, Hallaq is excellent. Very engaging, very funny. However, it did bother me somewhat that the class (Central Questions in Islamic Law) wasn't tightly structured, but of course, that's a matter of personal preference. He does have a very clear narrative for the class, which sometimes could become overwhelming. Nonetheless, he's a very cool guy, and obviously, super knowledgeable and passionate about the subject\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand full of funny stories and tidbits of information. As for the class make-up, it was largely a good group; there were bearly any people who were terribly annoying.\nWorkload:\nVery light\n-Weekly readings (100+ pages a week) but you really don't have to do them\n-A five minute presentation which literally takes 5 minutes to compose and then give as he stares out a window\n-A 5,000 word paper that was pretty easily graded despite the threat that only 30% of the class would receive A's.\nI'd recommend.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf Hallaq is great. Super smart, super engaging, he's a great professor and a funny guy. \nCentral Questions to Islamic Law is a good choice with not too much work. Weekly readings, one 5 min presentation on a reading and a big old research paper at the end. You can write about whatever you want which is nice. Though beware, he tends to call on people randomly to summarize readings...fear of his disapproval is enough encouragement for most to read, but many get away with not. \nClass draws an interesting crowd. About half Muslims, a quarter JTS, and a smattering of other interested parties. He loves engaged students and gets off on class participation. No prior knowledge of the subject matter is necessary, despite what one might think. He does offer suggestions for background reading for the uptight. \n\nWorkload:\nWeekly readings\n1 five min presentation\n25 page research paper at the end\nno exams\n"
