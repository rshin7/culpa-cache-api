            "review_content": "\nChris ran this phys-ed class just as I was hoping it would be run: under the philosophy that \"you can make of this what you will--you can choose how much you want to get out of this experience.\" The only rules were that you should show up no more than 5 minutes late to class and you couldn't miss more than 6 classes in total. But other than that, Chris was smart, friendly, approachable, and willing to give fitness advice if you asked for it... but totally didn't dictate what you had to do. I found that I actually ended up doing more than I originally thought I would, just because it wasn't compulsory. You feel better about exercising when you can determine for yourself how hard you want to push yourself--it comes so much easier when you're not doing it because you feel forced but because you are taking pride in setting your own pace and goals for yourself. \nWorkload:\nhitting the gym for about 45 minutes twice a week\n"
