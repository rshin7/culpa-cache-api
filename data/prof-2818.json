            "review_content": "\nProfessor Alland is retired, but he comes back every spring to teach this course.  The course is on Fridays because every other week is a field trip to a museum or site in the city.  He is enthusiastic and knowledgable about the topic and respects his students' opinions.  Class discussions are based on readings, which you can skim.  Overall the course is not a lot of work since readings are only assigned for every other week (no readings for field trip weeks).  There is a 20-page open-ended final paper.  I would definitely recommend this class.\n"
