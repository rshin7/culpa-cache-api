            "review_content": "\nThe course is interesting, and Prof Feldman really enjoys the material espcially cnsidering that his advisor at MIT was the man who wrote the book you use. He is not the most exciting of lecturers, but he does cover the material in a effecient and clean manor. Prof Feldman is always ready to help, and seems to enjoy students coming to office hours to talk about P vs NP or the Red Sox, its your choice. He is a solid proffesor and I would recommend him if you are going to take computability.\nWorkload:\n6 problem sets, worth a lot. 3 quizes worth less. And a Final not worth as much as the problem sets. Get good grades of the p sets and you will be solid.\n"
