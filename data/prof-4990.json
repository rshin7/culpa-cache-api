            "review_content": "\nMichael is a genuinely nice professor who wants to challenge his students. He facilitates great discussions and knows an insane amount of literary theory, which is one of the perspectives he brings to his teaching. We often looked at the texts from really peculiar and not immediately obvious angles, but this made the course more stimulating. He's also very funny. That said, he has a tendency to focus on close reading to the exclusion of any discussion of overall theme or meaning, so if you're more interested in discussing the symbolism or context, he may not be the best choice for you. However, he helps you to hone your skills for this method of analyzing the literature, so the exposure he gives you to close reading techniques can be valuable. All in all, a great guy and professor. Note that he is very big on organization, punctuality, etc. Absolutely no extensions or late work accepted.\nWorkload:\nStandard LitHum syllabus with none of the optional supplementary readings. Around ten CW postings of 300-600 words. Three papers - the first is four pages, the second two are five pages each. Midterm mimics the final and prepares you well for it. Final is the standard departmental final for LitHum.\n"
