Professor Cautis is indeed soft-spoken, but I sat in the back of the classroom for most of the semester and was able to hear him clearly. He does only go off examples, but I found his explanations of the thought processes behind calculus before delving into those lent me a much stronger understanding of the material than I had previously been taught. Some of the examples are obviously developed to lengthen the class time, as we often would get out ten or even twenty minutes late, but this is more of a testament of Cautis's ability to get to the point of each lecture rather than ramble on.\nAs a new professor, he obviously has flaws in being stuck in that distant didactic lecture style, but he showed an obvious passion for mathematics and often showed it through the way he talked about the concepts. Also, his style was very appropriate for calculus, though still in the rough, especially at the beginning of the semester, when his lectures seemed more muddled, but he improved over the semester. \nThe two midterms were relatively easy. The final, however, was a bit harder, and I'm guessing it was extraordinarily curved from the difference between my semester grade and what I got on it.\nI went to lectures usually to listen to the first twenty or thirty minutes before they got too dry, then after that I would do something else and then pay attention again to copy down his very clear notes. It is also of note that some of his examples were also on midterms and the final.\nWorkload:\n1 problem set of ~10 problems/week that took at most an hour or two.\n"

He goes over many examples with the class and is always willing for in-class discussion and explains well questions that people have.   He's approachable and friendly outside of class.  The material gets progressively harder throughout the semester (on a grander scale than most classes), such that the first third may seem easy, the second moderate, and the last, pretty impossible.  But the whole class works that way, so the curve is good...although the class is curved around a C\nWorkload:\nweekly homework assignments, mix of even and odd problems; 2 midterms; final worth 50%\n"

He throws the material at you and expects you to understand. When students ask him questions in class, he does not explain so that we can understand. His exams are mostly theoretical stuff and he gives no practice exam before the midterm....Takes him forever to respond to you via email.
