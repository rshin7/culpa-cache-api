She is very animated and keeps Art History fun and energetic even though some of the material can be pretty dry. Works great with students, but big on punctuality so do not be late to class. This was one of my favorite classes and she is definitely the professor to take for art hum. \nThe class is a lot of memorization and not intensive with daily homework, just need to study for exams.\nWorkload:\nSummer Session:\n1 Paper 5-6 pages long\n2 Midterms and 1 Final\n"
