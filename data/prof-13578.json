The dude is so passionate about pop music and its history, super understanding and kind, an enthusiastic grader and comment-er, and plays such good music in class. Everyone in my class loved different kinds of music, from classical to jazz to Top 40 pop, and Aidan made sure to foster everyone's contributions. The syllabus is amazing and I would recommend reading everything on it even if you're not in the class. Also, read one of his books if you get the chance \u2014 he's a good writer and a great researcher.\nWorkload:\nLight, with semi-optional \"exercises\" and tons of support for the four essays. \n"
