            "review_content": "\nCris Beam is a passionate, personable, unorthodox professor who's is also on-target with her readings and writing exercises. My afternoons were always brightened by her humor, and she always allows a break during class. Though she is unusually empathetic to students' needs, she isn't unconditionally supportive--she will provide constructive criticism and admit her own biases and weaknesses in her points of view. She does offer her own experiences as a writer, which I think are helpful, rather than annoying, as the previous review suggests. \nShe is a progressive thinker who offers perspectives that are refreshingly different from the often stuffy Columbia atmosphere\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgiving voice to queer, gender, \"the other.\"\nProfessor Beam is also totally energetic and works hard to keep up class morale. She will use diagrams, systems, tricks to help approach the writing process strategically\u00e2\u20ac\u201dright brain+left brain. My only issues with the class is her kindness allows for long, labyrinthine elaborations from hyped-up students; I'd rather hear more of her comments and feedback, especially more line edits in the papers. \nAll in all, a professor who is an example of what professors of the future can be.\nWorkload:\nmanageable weekly readings and sometimes reading responses, one midterm paper (draft and final), one final paper (draft and final).\n"

            "review_content": "\nReally nice, picks good readings.  She isn't vain, so to speak, but she does talk about herself and her own writing... A LOT.  It can be kind of irritating, but she is much better than some of the other teachers in the department.  And she actually cares about the students... so, if you are looking for a class in the creative writing department, you could do much worse, and probably not much better.\nWorkload:\nquite a bit -- one of the only classes I've taken that you actually have to do outside reading for... but it's not bad stuff, and it's helpful.  plus you do writing exercises and peer reviews, and two final projects that you are essentially working on throughout the semester.\n"

She is a prof that strongly believes in her craft, and it shows in her excellent and inclusive style of teaching. She gives her students a lot of respect, is always interested in what they have to say, and gives constructive criticism that is immensely helpful. It is because of her that I am becoming a writing major.\nWorkload:\nWeekly readings, which are always interesting, 4 papers  that go through several stages of drafts. No midterm or final. Very manageable workload, even moreso because it's always interesting reading.\n"
