            "review_content": "\nDo not let the title fool you. The class could have, and should have been interesting, but Mr. Friedson made the class boring, and almost unberable. To begin, he makes interesting material, like discussions on race, dry and overly complex. Then, he bases essays on overly substantial reference to texts and outside research. Basically, you can save your opinion for someone who cares....because he doesn't. He wants hard facts. The final exam left room for a more open-ended response, but in general he naturally prefers student to give cut and dry answers, not use the texts to support their own view. If you like to think for yourself, this is not the class for you. \nWorkload:\nMedium to light reading loads. Midterm, Final (5-7 pages), Research paper (10-12 pages), and short autobiographical responses for homework (4-5). All assignments are out of class writings.  \n"
