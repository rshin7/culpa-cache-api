            "review_content": "\nJang is a very nice guy who says some very funny things with no intention of bieng funny. I personally really liked him because he does fulfill what university writing is trying to show us, which is the need to edit. That said, he grades fairly harshly, given that I had to edit multiple times to get A's, but he is not harsh to the point where it's discouraging.\nHe says some fairly random things and scrawls random books on the board which no one really understands why sometimes, but he's still a pretty good professor. His instructions are clear, and even though he talks quietly, most of us understand and hear all of his instructions. Jang is a great professor who will respond to emails promptly and is willing to give help on essays. I really enjoyed his class, partly because of the people in my class but also due to him. \nWorkload:\nLens Essay , Conversation Essay, Research Essay, and Retrospective essay, group presentation\nwill boost up grade 1/3 on each essay if written exercises are not bs, can also take down 1/3 of a grade if you don't do it. bs = no grade boost\nwill boost overall grade 1/3 based on class participation can take down or do nothing. but is fairly generous with the boosts\n"
