The best part about this class is that we study history through a wide range of materials: the lecture discusses the events, the readings include contemporary documents, the movies offer unique interpretations, and the discussions analyze important philosophies of the period. Each part of the class has its function. Philosophies and ideologies are a focus of this class as well as the historical events. We have discussed liberalism, romanticism, socialism, nationalism, fascism, and many other contemporary philosophies relevant to the events. We include readings that are often the origins of these philosophies, which help us understand these complex ideas greatly. The class also does not fail to differentiate the By taking this course I have learned much more than historical events alone. \nThere are, however, a few downsides to this course. The grade is not curved at all so it's a bit hard to figure out how you are doing in the class. The quality of the discussion sections vary greatly according to the TA you get. My discussion section was pretty dry for the most part, even if I've enjoyed reading the materials. \nFinal grade of the commentator: A\nWorkload:\nWeekly readings, about 50 pages.\nThree books/novels: Christmas Carol, Communist Manifesto, After the Wall\nOne 6-8 pages paper\nMid-term and Final (both with study guides)\n"

While this wasn't a particular area of history that I enjoy, I learned an incredible amount throughout the semester and really felt like I got to see a unique perspective that was thoughtfully laid out. I came to every class and took copious notes, largely due to how much I learned at each lecture. However, the feelings I took away were mostly negative, due to Professor Tiersten. I am not the type of student to complain simply because of a bad grade, if the grade is explained logically and reasonably. Yet her grading was strangely harsh and completely devoid of logical comments. I had always had a good opinion of her in class, she had always seemed very nice and friendly. Then I met with her to discuss a paper which I felt had been graded much too severely. I've never had a meeting with a professor who was so condescending and disrespectful in my entire college experience. Several times, she would ask me to explain something and then interrupt with her own interpretation before I could get even a sentence out. The punitive grading continued with both exams, it seemed as though she was manufacturing reasons to take points off. The course had great potential, but turned into a nightmare because of the way it was handled.  \nWorkload:\nLots of reading, but definitely manageable. A midterm exam, essay and final exam, all graded unreasonably harshly. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI just want to preface this by saying that I practically majored in Tiersten. I was a history major, and I've known Professor Tiersten for the last four years. This won't be too specific to a class because I've taken so many and my opinion of her is consistent across all classes. I've taken two lectures -- her Modern Europe class, her Colonial Encounters, a Consumer Culture seminar, AND she was my senior thesis adviser... so anything I'm about to say is not based on one class where I might've gotten lucky with a kind TA, etc. She is awesome. She is brilliant, she is entertaining and charismatic, and in response to some of the other less than glowing reviews, she is only intimidating because she does remember everything she's ever read. If you find her condescending, it's probably because you didn't read the readings or pay attention, and therefore said something absurd OR worse-- you googled ID's instead of citing unique information she told you herself--at which point, I'm sure she DID tell you off. There is no doubt that she doesn't sugarcoat anything, but that's what makes her so effective and so helpful. If her emails seem \"rude\" or \"condescending\", they aren't. She just has a million things that she has going on during her days and yet she still responds to emails in record time so... not sure what more students want. And if you reach out to her, she will be there to help you find the resources you need for writing papers, etc. In response to the reviewer commenting on how she doesn't like questions about ID's on the study guides she gives before midterms and finals, it's because everything on there has been covered in lectures and readings, so if you're asking for more than just a clarification, she knows you weren't there or weren't listening, so why SHOULD she tell you again? She is approachable, helpful, and really doesn't make it hard for you to do well, especially in her lecture courses. Both Modern Europe and Colonial Encounters cover a lot of time and places, but you learn a lot. And to everyone commenting on how fast she talks -- no doubt this is true. Just don't be lazy and type your notes instead of trying to write down every word she says. I don't want anyone to think I'm being \"rude\" or \"condescending\" myself in this mini-rant, but I just really think it would be a shame if anyone shopping for classes, especially freshmen, who haven't yet been exposed to professors like Professor Tiersten and don't know better than to solely rely on CULPA, were convinced that she wasn't worth taking. She is, and I would know, because I chose to do it four times... and I WOULD have taken more if there had been more. \nWorkload:\nModern Europe and Colonial Encounters - one midterm and final each, both with IDs and essay questions, that are given to you on a study guide before the exam. Each lecture also has one 5-7 page paper based on a list of questions she provides. Modern Europe has textbook reading as well as novels that are discussed in discussion section. Colonial Encounters is mostly various readings compiled either in coursepack (unless this part has changed) or online. \nSeminar- heavy reading, because it's a seminar and IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A LOT OF READING, and a 15 page paper. Student-led discussions every week. \n"

The first class, I wasn't thrilled, but I was intrigued to see how the Professor would break down and disseminate all of the information (It is a huge amount of time to cover). The second class left me feeling that all too familiar, \"maybe I should shop around the course catalog,\" but instead, I ignored my initial reaction, and stuck with the class. Though I wish this was one of those stories where I go on to tell you how happy I am to have stuck with it, and how rewarding the class turned out to be, that definitely was Not the case. This was the only class where I had to force myself to keep my eyes open, and please, do not mistake me for a student who sleeps in class, because that is not the case. She rambled on and on about such minute facts, yet sped through significant, monumental events in history. History is not my major, but after having taken an Amazing American History course the previous semester, I felt inspired and I desired to become more acquainted with European history. Well, the only time I learned anything of significance was before studying for the exam, and it was not enjoyable, nor enriching. \nWith that being said, exams are fair, and a study guide is handed out a week before, but you are at the mercy of a TA who grades all of your work (unless you end up in Tiersten's section for discussion). My TA was not pleasant, no rude, just blah and while trying to be helpful, just added more jumble to the mixture. \nAnother note...people remark about how quickly she speaks and this is 100% on point. It was tedious taking notes in her class and difficult to follow along. Just thoroughly unenjoyable. I am not one to write reviews, but I just wanted to forewarn anyone else who might find the subject intriguing, sit in the first class feeling mixed, and tell them to go find a different class!!! It's not hard, just a waste of time.\nWorkload:\nA midterm of ID's and 1 essay (previously handed out to the class with about 70 ID's yet only 5 on the exam, and 10 essay prompts, of which 3 appear on the exam, and you write 1)\nA paper between 5-7 pages\nA final exam, same format as the midterm, except for the inclusion of a short essay (study guide handed out beforehand).\nOn top of the text, there are additional readings, comprised of books/articles, which are tied into your essay exam and are discussed in recitations.\nAlso, 4 movies that are to be watched during the semester.\n"

I walked away from each class feeling accomplished and so much more knowledgable. She speaks rapid-fire style but you'll learn to keep up immediately. The course is also not extremely demanding.

You don't come across that last quality too often while at Columbia and Barnard. The texts we read we're interesting, completely relevant to feminist traditions, and useful for a comprehensive overview of feminist theory. She allows students to facilitate class, so it's peer-led, but she'll jump in when she needs to make a point or guide the discussion in a more correct direction. Definitely worth taking a class with her. \nOh, and she's so cool, she even created a snack schedule for the class. \nWorkload:\nTypical seminar reading (and work): 70-300 pages.

While obviously a talented historian and an enthusiastic, if wildly disorganized lecturer, Tiersten is all over the place with this course. The vague subtitle of the course--European Culture in the Age of Empire--is telling: with such a broad time period to cover, Tiersten is unable to focus on either domestic events or their consequences for empire. Lectures are scattered, class discussion painfully reductive, and Tiersten's sweet-but-scatty appeal is undercut by her habit of brusquely interrupting students in order to tell would-be amusing anecdotes. Her classroom manner could use a dose of Professor Snape--she seems unable to exert authority, and lectures are ruined by her stream-of-consciousness remarks on her coffee, her missing glasses, and the attractiveness of the male actors in the clips she shows.\n The course jumped from region to region without even attempting to make parallels or comment on trends in colonial policy, which was my biggest problem with it. This is a sorry excuse for a history class at best. \nWorkload:\nRidiculously easy. About one-fourth the amount of reading for an average 3000-level history course.

She is so knowledgeable; the information she is able to convey coherently in a lecture setting is astounding.  More importantly, she doesn't assign impossible amounts of work.  For either lectures or seminars, her paper assignments are focused on quality, not quantity.  Lectures require a crisp 5-7 page paper, and seminars a 15 page paper, both of which are very manageable.  As for her reading assignments, I admit that she does demand a large amount of reading, and expect for it to be done.   However, the reading material is always carefully selected and interesting.  Perhaps the best aspect of her reading lists is that she rarely requires the reading of a whole book, but rather selects choice chapters which highlight the author's key points and argument.  Professor Tiersten wants you to enjoy and learn from her classes, which is one of best traits.  A true gold nugget!\nWorkload:\nManageable.

If you've taken any sort of high-school Euro history class, then this class will be a complete recap.  That would be fine if Prof. Tiersten added a new perspective to familiar information, but she doesn't.  This is especially frustrating because I am sure she has an interesting perspective on European history (why else would she have been hired?), but she never lets it show in her lectures.  Instead, her lectures sound as if she is reading them straight out of a textbook.  Not only that, but she talks SO fast.  This isn't totally her fault, as 1789-present is a ridiculously large timespan to cover in one semester, but it's hard to absorb anything when she's talking that fast.  Also, as much as I hate having to find room in my schedule for weekly discussion sections, I really wish this class had had weekly sections. At least then I would have been accountable for the reading. Instead, there is this awkward arrangement where we miss lecture every few weeks to meet with a TA in a small-ish discussion section.  Over the course of four meetings, the TAs barely have the chance to learn your name.  Furthermore, the sections are so big that it's easy to get away with not having done any of the reading. Yes, I should have done the reading anyway, but I was not engaged at all with this class and had little incentive to do all the work.  Basically, if you're looking for a filler class that probably won't stress you out very much, then this is fine. If you're looking to gain some insight on European history, this isn't the right class for you. \nWorkload:\nA fair amount of reading which, as far as I could tell, very few people actually did.

            "review_content": "\nSince most of what needed to be said was already said, I want to add just a few quick points about Prof. Tiersten and the class, trying not overlap in content too much. First, it is easy to notice that Prof. Tiersten was a great gal in her younger years, though she\u00c2\u2019s not really old \u00c2\u2013 maybe 35-40? \u00c2\u2013 nowadays either. As a result, she\u00c2\u2019s really sociable in general and really cute to watch; she manages to be adorable even when she lectures. In terms of academics, all I can say is \"wow\". I don\u00c2\u2019t think there anything this woman doesn\u00c2\u2019t know about history. On one hand, this is a good, because if you have a question (though she doesn't take questions during lecture, given the turbocharged style described in previous posts) she has an answer \u00c2\u2013 a good and long and informed and authoritative one. On the other hand, this is quite intimidating, especially if you\u00c2\u2019re new to history. She\u00c2\u2019ll tell you what the most common type of bread in Southern France 1790 was, and why that bread was replaced in 1795 with something else, and you\u00c2\u2019ll be left wondering: do I need to know this?? The good news is that you don\u00c2\u2019t; it\u00c2\u2019s just that her mind functions like a fractal \u00c2\u2013 once she gets talking about something, given that she know so much about anything, details like that just pour into her brain. You have a study guide for the exams, and that\u00c2\u2019s what you need to know. \nAs for the class, I do have some words of caution, though my final conclusion is that this is a class worth taking. First, there are a lot of posts here saying this is an easy ride. It\u00c2\u2019s true, you can skip lectures every now and then, and it\u00c2\u2019s also true that you can cram for a week before the exam and get an A, like I did. However, there\u00c2\u2019s massive amounts of information that you need to take in, and despite Prof. Tiersten\u00c2\u2019s great lectures (as someone else said before, don\u00c2\u2019t take too many notes \u00c2\u2013 just write down the main ideas and enjoy listening to her; it\u00c2\u2019s really worth it), everything appears disorganized. That\u00c2\u2019s because the textbook is really poor in organizing history, skipping back and forth between the years until all you\u00c2\u2019re left with is some random dates and names and nowhere to place them. To add to this, Prof. Tiersten has her own teaching plan, which sometimes deviates from the book. Finally, you\u00c2\u2019re given a study guide before the exam in which the IDs are mixed with only slight consideration for their historical order. In the end, if you\u00c2\u2019re looking at \"Red Shirts\" on your study guide and you weren\u00c2\u2019t paying attention in class, you have some serious detective work to do until you find the term in your textbook \u00c2\u2013 as anyone from the French Revolution to the fall of the USSR could have worn red shirts (hint: it\u00c2\u2019s Garibaldi\u00c2\u2019s troops). With these caveats (don\u00c2\u2019t expect an easy ride and pay attention in class), I think this is one of the best history classes you could take. The lectures are simply amazing and so is the teacher, the period covered is really interesting (French Revolution, Napoleon, the two world wars, colonialism, communism, post-war Europe), and, overall, it's easy to get a good grade IF you\u00c2\u2019re paying attention and spend some time studying before the exams. Although the assigned readings are interesting, the discussion sections are not that useful \u00c2\u2013 on the contrary, they\u00c2\u2019re quite annoying. Make sure you attend though \u00c2\u2013 they count for 15% of your grade.  \nI have to say that I held back on the praise and addressed the rougher sides of the class solely because everything positive about it was already said in other reviews. This is a class not to be missed, and I highly recommend it. I don't think there are many students in the class who haven't enjoyed it, and that's saying a lot for a class of more than 100. \nWorkload:\nFairly light. About 50 pages/week which can be skimmed or simply skipped \u00c2\u2013 just make sure you know what they\u00c2\u2019re about so you can throw in you 2 cents in discussion. If you have the time, they\u00c2\u2019re worth reading. 4-7 pages paper, doable overnight. Midterm and final, with essays and IDs taken straight from the study guide, which is distributed one week in advance. No curveballs, what you see on the study guide is what you get. Overall: definitely doable, and getting an A is not hard at all.\n"

This class, about the effects of colonialism on imperial nations, was a fascinating study of how perceptions of the primitive changed through the centuries. Since it's so broad--500 years and an entire globe--she focuses more on the anthropological theories than the actual dates and names, which is fine if you're a theory person. Right after the semester ended, I took a vacation in Costa Rica, and found myself talking about it more than any other class.

She goes extremely quickly, and if you don't have much of a mind for history it can be quite intimidating. The other reviewers do a good job summarizing this class, so I'll leave it there.\nThe women's studies class, however, is quite the opposite. A small women's studies seminar can be fantastic or awful depending on the teacher, and i LOVE Tiersten for this class. While she is a little ADD and a little all over the place, her class is thoroughly enjoyable. She has a very clear idea of where she wants the class to go, and is good at linking the theoretical points to the broader climate at the time. I guess that's why she's a history teacher. In the class we have really interesting and in-depth conversations, and it really feels like a safe space to share and learn. Exactly what a women's studies class should be. I don't know if she'll be teaching it again soon, but it's much better than the other wmst seminars I've taken, I highly recommend it. \nWorkload:\nhistory: see other reviewers\nfem texts 2: a lot of reading (but that's to be expected in a seminar), a thought posting (to make sure you've done the reading) on courseworks before every class, lead/moderate one class session, final 10-15 page research paper on whatever you want. \n"

She seems like a professor who isn't here to write books and monographs and up her standing; she's really just here to teach.  In a class of this scope, it's very important for the professor to know how to emphasize certain events and gloss over others, how to employ anecdotes to illustrate a broader theme, and how to use visual aids successfully.  She does all three of these masterfully.  She successfully coveys the basic historical facts and dates, but more importantly, she gives you a feel for the period, allowing the student to transcend his present day worldview and enter that of, say, a 19th century British politician or a Russian peasant at the turn of the 20th.  She's also a nice person, which counts for a lot, because she's got a great sense of humor and she's the very opposite of pompous.  Finally, I got to sit in on her discussion section (props to any professor who gets involved with their own discussion sections) and I liked the way she let students think things through on their own terms but how she also wasn't afraid to tell a student when his interpretation was a bit off.  You will enjoy this class so much that you won't want to take notes during classes; you'll just want to listen.\nWorkload:\nI found the workload fairly light, but the coursereader especially is geared less towards historical events and more towards philosophical treatises, etc. that try to color in the spirit of the age.\n"

The class covers a lot of material (so much that many interesting historical events and trends have to be skimmed over or crammed into the end of lecture), but Tiersten does a good job with it. She obviously knows her stuff, and she's especially good at linking major historical events to the intellectual and artistic trends that they influenced. (Her interpretations are pretty standard, but she always provides a couple alternative analyses for each major topic.) Even though she speaks very rapidly, she's usually very engaging and almost funny at times. She was always running out of time, but that's the nature of a course that attempts to cover as much as this one. I liked her lectures most of the time and would definitely consider taking more classes with her.  \nWorkload:\nThe reviewer who said Tiersten assigned too much reading was way off. The textbook can be skipped (just go to lecture... you can even skip that a couple times if you want to), and the course packet readings are usually around 30-50 pages per class. The outside books are longer, but you have more time to read them. She also requires screenings of various movies (most of which were in French, set during wartime, and included a murder, trial, and execution... don't ask me why) about once a month. Overall, not too bad. She even provides study guides with all the IDs and essay questions for the mid-term and final, so if you don't know what to study then you're beyond help. The only aggravating part of the class was the discussion section, despite the admittedly nice TAs, and even those are not weekly. Oh, and there's a short term paper (5-7 pages, I think) that can be done in a day if you're pressed for time. In case you can't tell, this is an easy course.\n"

She didn't utilize visual aids much and she overwhelms you with information, often talking so fast it's hard to understand her.  She handed out outlines at the start of the class, but the material all seemed to be crammed together so that it didn't seem as structured as maybe she intended it to be.  She was a little confusing at times.  She was, however, always prepared.  And even though her lectures were rather vapid, part of that may have just been the course itself.  Covering so much history in so little time tends to make the course more about names and dates since there is less time to go indepth.  Survey courses in history are, perhaps, inherently bad.\nWorkload:\nThere was a rather significant amount of reading outside of class.  There was a course reader, various books, and a text book.  You could probably easily get away with not reading the textbook if you are able to pay attention in lecture and take good notes since it's essentially the same information.

Covering Colonial Encounters is a daunting subject, and so instead of focusing on a few events this becomes a survey course with enough information to make one interested in a subject but never enough to make one knowledgable. The course seems geared towards maximizing information for ids for the exams. Further, Tiersten does not know much of the material besides that gotten from textbooks. When talking about Africa for instace, she ignored many significant events in South African history in order to make her explanations seem as clear and logical as possible. Unfortunately, history is not always clear and many factors, not 1 or 2, influence events. This is a simplified history course geared towards memorization. Nobody does the reading and even the TAs are bored, either not showing up or looking out windows.

You might really want to consider this because her exam-style is to give out prepatory essays and a slew of ID's. If you prepare the essays and the ID's you will do well - that's all there is to it. But there are a lot of essays (between 5 and 7) and ID's (around 50) to prepare. They require a good deal of thought and a really thorough knowledge of lectures, plus some of the text and readings but they show up word for word on the exam - no curve balls. While she does tend to digress, it's only because she can't stand not covering items of interest more thoroughly than she gave herself time to do on the outline. This means that she talks REALLY FAST; it's good to study with others because it's almost impossible to get it all and her lectures are she so interesting that there will be times you simply won't want to be distracted by taking notes. She really cares about her students; wants their input and will be blunt, but never rude, if she doesn't agree.

I would take any class with this woman. She could probably make tax code exciting.

Seriously, you could have hated history all your life, but take this class and fall in love with it. She does that to you.\nWorkload:\nLots of reading, but most of it can be skimmed. A few movies to go to at nights, but nothing you can't live without. A paper, a midterm, a final. If you go to class, you WILL do well. (and you'll want to go to class.)\n"
