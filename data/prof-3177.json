What a friggin' excellent teacher. The previous review nails it on the head: this guy manages to be both VERY demanding and at the same time VERY fun. He's clear, energetic, helpful, precise, funny - anything you could hope for in a teacher. Last but not least, I was amazed to find out he was American - based on his accent I was sure he's native French.\nWorkload:\nLOTS and LOTS of work. But it's a language course, what do you expect?\n"

            "review_content": "\nWhen I first showed up to class, I was expecting an old, strict Soviet professor, but instead got an energetic young scholar with a Jew-fro.  Matt was so great.  He combines academic rigor and fun in his teaching style, and yields amazing results.  Not only did my French improve in such a short time, the class was dynamic and passed by quickly.  Workload is heavy, and there is a pretty annoying group project near the end of the course, but this class was worth it.  He also has a wonderful accent in French and tries to help us improve ours.  Great professor.  \nWorkload:\nHeavy because all the work from one semester was condensed into 6 weeks.  Workbook, a few compositions, a few tests, group project, nothing too bad.\n"
