Super friendly and easy to interact with, ask questions, etc...The difference between him and Ana Paola is that she stresses speaking the language more, even in her elementary class. \nWorkload:\nVery light work load. Workbook pages for daily hw that he usually never takes up, quizzes (each worth only 1% so no pressure at all), an essay, 2 oral presentations, a midterm and a final. \n"
