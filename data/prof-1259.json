            "review_content": "\nAlthough the class material is interesting and Higgins is a famous researcher, the class was disorganized. There are no practice  tests to prepare you for the midterm and final, and the textbook overlaps  with the class material in about  50/50% of the times. Mr. Higgins decides what research matters from his own  or from the people that best represent his point. Also,  he tells the class where he disagrees with the textbook sometimes. Otherwise, you better guess. It is imperative to show up to every single class or you won't have the material that you  need for the exams. The exams can have two right answers, but we have to guess the best right answer between them, which I found tricky. The online notes given by the TA's don't have all the material  that you need to succeed. They are a poor summary of the lecture. In addition, the tests don't really reflect your knowledge. There is a lot of memorization as expected from a psychology class. This class requires more preparation and time with Higgins than you think for an A .Lastly, he has a good sense of humor, is kind and knowledgeable. Yet,I wouldn't take the class with him again, unless I have more time.\nWorkload:\nLot of reading. 35% Midterm, 50% Final and 15% assignments. All multiple choice or you can choose to have half of the exam as a multiple choice and the other half as an essay.\n"

I attended all the lectures and paid attention, not so much because my grade required it but because I got so much out of going. Tory is a leader in the field but he is also an incredible teacher.\nI highly, highly recommend this class to anyone, whatever you're studying. Attend the first few lectures to see if you like his style, and go from there.\nWorkload:\nEasy. Attend the lectures and go over the assigned readings before the midterm and final. The tests are all multiple choice, which is stupid, but if you know the material you'll be fine.\n"

            "review_content": "\nLectures were very slow; he never uses Powerpoints unless it's for in-class \"experiments,\" so it's difficult to take notes and pacing is very odd. I took the class with a friend who really liked the slow and repetitive lectures, but I found them exhaustingly boring.\nTory also has a tendency to overgeneralize. He's definitely a big name in the field, and his insights into some commonly cited social psych experiments is very valuable, but his gender essentializing (\"men are always like this, women are always like this\") gets really grating after a while - especially since it seemed taken for granted that these differences were natural or innate.\nThe material is so interesting; I just wish he were a more engaging lecturer.\nWorkload:\nEasy exams and a few exercises scattered through the semester. The exercises are graded weirdly depending on your TA (mine seemed to grade them randomly). Lecture attendance isn't mandatory.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI don't know why Higgins doesn't have a gold nugget. He is a bona fide brilliant professor.\nHiggins is brilliant in the traditional sense, of course. He's an academic bigwig, and his studies and pictures will appear in more psychology textbooks than you can handle. This, to me, is always less important than how good of a teacher someone is (after all, we're at Columbia. I'd at least hope that my teachers were accomplished and intelligent). Higgins is remarkable in this way, too. His lectures are engaging, keep you involved, make you laugh, and blow your mind at times. He relates facts and take-aways easily and runs through the main points and ramifications of every experiment, relating it to the four broad themes of the course. \nIf you have a hard time paying attention in class, I can see why you may have complaints. His powerpoints are bare because he saves almost all of the information for the physical act of lecturing, and though the TAs do a good job with the distributed \"take home messages\" of each lecture, they're not enough. But I am generally as ADD as they come and I was swept up in all of his lectures. Again, he's an incredibly interesting person to listen to. He makes you want to go and take down every word out of his mouth.\nSign up for this class. You'll really like it. But once you're in, commit to it. You'll get so much out of it because you're taking it seriously and you'll enjoy it immensely.\nWorkload:\nFour take-home short writing assignments, midterm worth 35%, final worth 50%. Keep up in class, know your experiments and themes, and breeze through the text and you'll be fine.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI write this review not so much to talk about Higgins himself. He's well-established in his field and clearly very, very sharp. He'll challenge standard Social Psych concepts (for example, the mainstream interpretation of Millgram's work) by pointing to their blind-spots; he's not one to merely repeat what the textbook says. In fact, he rarely if ever alludes to it, which I think is a strength of the course. And he's a pretty funny guy, so the material--which is interesting on its own--seems even more engaging.\nI'm writing because I've noticed that a lot of previous reviewers have complained about the course's grading in ways that seem comically misplaced. I want to set the record straight. You have one midterm (35% of grade), one non-cumulative final (50%), and four short one-page assignments (15%). Each exam is either wholly multiple choice or one part MC and one part essay (each person can pick his/her preferred format). If your essay is way better than your MC, only your essay counts. MC is eminently fair. Some questions were dropped from the midterm because they were later deemed ambiguous. Questions come from both lectures and the book. Those that come from lecture are about the MAIN POINTS discussed in class. There's nothing nit-picky. Moreover, after each class the main points are *given by the TAs!* A \"take-home points\" document is posted on course-works for each class session. True, sometimes questions required a little bit of imagination--not everything can be answered merely by rote recall of the take-home points--but there are no grounds for reasonable complaint here. For those questions whose answers come from the book, these are similarly main-point oriented. A few are really specific, but these are just to separate the A+'s from the As. If you just want an A, you don't have to go crazy memorizing the book. And even if you want an A+ (which I got), you just have to read the chapter once while paying close attention. Each chapter should take 2 hours to get through, which isn't much if you do one chapter a week.\nAbout the take-home assignments. They're graded on a scale of 1-3 corresponding to A/B/C. The reviewer below who claims that Jamil is some malevolent TA who refuses to give As seems not to have considered the possibility that his assignments just weren't that great. He gave me and my friends As. This is anecdotal of course but I don't have anything else to go on. The bottom-line here is that, like the multiple-choice, a tiny bit of imagination is required to do well. This is not Science of Psych or Mind, Brain, and Behavior where you can breeze through just by memorizing everything in sight.\nBasically, I don't want the reviewers below who have complained about the \"difficulty\" of this course to scare people away from taking it. Higgins is a really great professor and it would be a shame if you decided not to take this class because some people who didn't do as well as they would have liked decided to write misleading CULPA reviews. It's not that much work and you'll learn a lot.\nWorkload:\nLight. See above.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis is one of those classes where you may not get an A, but you'll walk away understanding the subject and interested in it. If you really care about your 4.0, be prepared to read every chapter in the book, spend hours on the assignments, and study endlessly for the tricky exams. If you just go to the lectures, you'll still learn a lot and walk away with an appreciation for social psych, and probably get a B+. I agree with most of the other reviews about Professor Higgins-- he is an academic heavyweight, really influential scholar in social psychology, and it's truly a privilege to learn with him. He's a GREAT lecturer and makes the material accessible without watering it down. The TA's can be annoying, and the outside assignments were not productive, but the lectures go by so quickly because he's just a great speaker who wrote the book on a lot of this stuff. Great class, highly recommended.\nWorkload:\nmidterm, final, 4 homework assignments graded on a 1-3 scale-- beware of these, they can really bring your grade down. exams are 1/2 multiple choice, with a choice for the second half for more multiple choice or an essay, questions on the exam are really tricky and there's no curve. \n"

Beware of the grade you will receive in this class, however - he does not curve and what you get is, well, what you get. There are several implications of this: \n1) The exams are primarily multiple-choice with the option to write an essay as part of them. The multiple choice was chosen by most people in the class - this means that to get an A you can make no more than 3 or 4 mistakes on a 50-question test. \n2) The 4 short assignments WILL impact your grade. There are two TAs, Lexi and Dave, who are very fair graders and reward you for your hard work; the third, Jamil, will give you a 2/3 no matter how well you write your paper - you might as well discover some new social psych principles and will still receive a 2/3. My guess is he doesn't really read any of the papers and just slaps on a mediocre grade for the third of the class misfortunate enough to have him review their assignment.\nOverall the class was entertaining - but thanks to 1/3 of the TA crew being jerks, don't expect to pull off an easy A.\n\nWorkload:\nMidterm and Final, multiple choice w/ option to write essay for part of the exam; four writing assignments that different TA's rotate through to grade. Jamil will demolish your grade and ruin your dreams of doing well in Prof. Higgins' class.\n"

Professor Higgins is knowledgeable, enthusiastic and really passionate about his field. He brings his own perspectives to class and offers interesting readings into a lot of areas in the field of social psychology. While he does not follow the textbook closely, it is a helpful read. The lectures are easy to follow and his TAs put up summaries of each lecture after class that are very helpful. Both Higgins and his TAs are very approachable and always open to answering questions. I really feel this course helped me understand the field of social psychology better while at the same time making me aware of some common pitfalls when dealing with research findings in this area and the importance of always thinking all sides through before making any judgments. I would definitely recommend this class. \nWorkload:\nThe textbook is kind of hard to get through because of the length and breadth of the chapters, but if you keep up with it on a regular basis its not a problem and is actually very interesting.\nThere are 4 out-of-class exercises that involve a one page report or conducting a simple experimental exercise.\nThere are two exams\u00e2\u20ac\u201da midterm exam (worth 35% of the final grade) and a final exam (worth 50% of the final grade).

You really need to go to class and have done the reading to get a good grade on the tests (but if you do the work, you'll do well) and while the exercises are a joke, as many other reviewers have said,  they are strangely graded harshly (they are graded with either a \"Pass\" or a \"Pass Plus,\" and most people receive a \"Pass\"). Though they are only 15 percent of the grade, they could come back to bite, as in my case. I got an A minus on both tests, but because I got only a \"Pass\" on the exercises, I got a B plus in the class.\nWorkload:\na midterm, worth 35 percent, a final, worth 50, and 4 exercises worth 15 percent, some reading, very low workload overall\n"

I read all of the text book assignments in the week before the midterm and final- though I regret not keeping up with it, as it would have added to his lectures.

He has a magical way of talking about a simple concept for 45 minutes and answering every single person's question--no matter how irrelevant or unintelligent the question is.  Plus, watch out for Eric the TA!!! Do not subject yourself to any of his \"review sessions\".  These \"review sessions\" consist of Eric preaching his reasons why he disagrees with everything Professor Higgins has taught during the semester.  I don't know why Higgins puts up with Eric.

The textbook is a great read in its entirety; while somewhat redundant, there is a fascinating world of psychology surrounding us.  And it's very cool to see that Higgins's research is mentioned.  Yes, his lectures are NOT a repetition of the book, and you DO need to attend every lecture and to take notes in order to do well on his exams (which are roughly 50% lecture based and 50% book based).  His multiple choice questions are tricky, regardless of what the TA tells you, and if you opt to do the essay instead of the remaining multiple choice questions on the final, you better be prepared to write a bible.  The exam says that \"Details are generally good,\" but no, I disagree -- details are mandatory.
