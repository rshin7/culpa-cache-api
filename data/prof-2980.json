It's also interesting how everyone can get the same grade on a paper (B-) especially after seeing different people's writing.  They're not that similar.  If it is at all possible, do not take this instructor.  If you are already in his section, switch it even if you have to take a class that gets out at midnight or starts (G-d forbid) at 8AM.  Trust me.\n"
