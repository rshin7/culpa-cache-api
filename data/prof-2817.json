            "review_content": "\nI took this because (1) I took Professor Marka's \"Physics for Poets\" class and loved/aced it; and (2) I'd heard from friends that it was the easiest class they'd ever taken. THIS CLASS IS NO LONGER EASY (if you don't know Physics and Math).  I think Professor Marka has had to crack down due to all the A's his students were getting, ha. \nFirst off: Professor Marka is AMAZING. He is hilarious, humble, kind, and so enthusiastic. Everyone adores this guy. AND-- he is THE genius who was recently on the front page of the New York Times for having confirmed Einstein's theory of general relativity by studying gravitational waves in space. He is truly one of the coolest professors at Columbia.\nThis class is not what it used to be, however.  Apparently (before the alleged crackdown) you could coast in this class. That is no longer the case -- this class, although easy and completely manageable if you put work into it, is not intuitive by any means.  Class attendance is no longer optional if you want to get a decent grade.  Much of what is discussed in class (guest speakers, etc.) is not Google-able and will be asked on the exam. \nDo the homework (answers are ALL Google-able, but they sometimes take a while to find) and write a decent term paper -- these are the only easy A's in this course.  For the final exams, make sure you GO TO RECITATION.  The team goes over what will be covered on the exam and will show you how to do the equations. The exams are still a bit tricky, though.  Thankfully, I took this course with a group of 6 friends, and if any of us missed class, we would fill each other in on what was covered. \n**TL; DR -- Professor Marka is the coolest, nicest professor ever, but this class is NO LONGER easy (if you don't know Physics and Math) and takes a lot of work.  Do really well on the homework and term papers (only easy A's in this course), and study/go to recitation for the exams. \nWorkload:\nSix homework sets (all answers are Google-able, but it takes a while to find some of the answers); 3 midterms (he drops the lowest grade); 1 final; 1 term paper.  Thankfully you're allowed \"cheat sheets\" for all midterms and for the final. \n"

If you're not a science person (which is who the class is obviously designed for) you will probably feel pretty lost the first few lectures. After a while you start getting some of the stuff and if you're interested you can learn a lot. If you're busy you can skip class and not miss a beat. \nWatching Professor Marka is the real pleasure. It's like someone gave a curious child unlimited resources and encouraged him to play with all the dangerous things in the lab. He gleefully handles liquid nitrogen and harasses his TA by being casually brilliant. He also speaks in a hilariously villainous German accent which can be a little hard to understand but makes the class that much more of a good time.  Professor Marka is a world class scientist who specializes in Black Holes and other mysterious shit. Get him to explain it all to you and take this class for an fun and easy way to knock out your science requirement. \nTL;DR Professor Marka is the man. Class is Easy A. Very little work. \n\nWorkload:\nTwo homework sets during the semester, 3 midterms, 1 final\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Marka was without question the nicest, most enthusiastic, most sincere guy I've ever met, let alone Columbia professor. He is BRILLIANT, immensely warm and understanding. He has a bit of a thick accent, but, at least for me, that made him all the more endearing. He asks very little of you for this class (not even that you show up most of the time), but if you do give him even a little bit of energy and/or curiosity, you will be rewarded in spades. Not only is he more than willing to give you a good grade for relatively little work, but he teaches amongst the most interesting and under-discussed courses at CU. WMDs is simply fascinating, and his enthusiasm is infectious. Don't worry about not being a scientist! He doesn't give the greatest explanations in the world of the complex scientific phenomena covered in this class, but they are serviceable, and you really don't need to understand it all--just get the essentials of how whatever he is describing works and you'll be fine (his explanations should be more than clear enough for you to do this). Moreover, though the class opens with some technical, dry explanations of nuclear reactions, it quickly moves on to a broader discussion of nuclear technologies that will appeal to anyone from political scientists, historians, and human rights majors to environmental scientists and engineers.\nI really cannot say enough nice things about this class and Professor Marka. This class was the most interesting class and (surprisingly because there is no work) amongst the most informative classes I've taken at Columbia. If ever a professor deserved a gold-nugget, it is Marka. He is simply the best. Definitely do yourself a favor and take WMDs.\nWorkload:\nBasically none. A joke of a problem set which you can just google the answers to (and which is the ONLY piece of work you get all semester), no required attendance, the final is an in-class essay of your choice (again, could not be easier--he wants to give you an A), and the class he asks you to lead is the only remotely difficult thing, but if you are even somewhat interested, it's really easy. He'll give you some recommended reading (lots of it) and you can do none of it if you want to, but I recommend reading some of his suggestions; it's really interesting stuff!\n"

I would recommend taking it if you're looking for an easy way to fulfill a science requirement and do not have a genuine interest in the material. Attendance is pretty much optional and in my opinion not necessary, The only times i went to class were to force myself to do the reading for another class that i had immediately after that, but other than that there was no point. And i really did try for about the first month.\nThe format of the class is pretty much some sort of experiment that usually doesn't work done by Marka and his assistant, this takes about 10-15 minutes then for the rest of the class he just goes through slides, many which have the word optional written across them, therefore REALLY discouraging me from paying any attention at all. \nthere were suppose to be problem sets due very two weeks but it took him about two months to actually get that going and the homeworks were long but you could mostly look up everything online. There were 3 midterms which he failed to evenly space out so towards the end of the semester it felt like we were having a midterm every two weeks, The midterms were mostly based off of questions in the practice given beforehand and the material seemed pretty basic, but I had never taken any sort of physics class before so I had no idea what the answers were if the answer wasn't previously given to me on the practice. Don't bother purchasing the textbook for this class, it is completely useless and won't help at all. Cheat Sheets allowed on all midterms anyway so you could put the practice exams on there. \noverall, the material isn't easy if you haven't taken physics before but the class also has a bizarre curve that pretty much ensures that everyone does well. \nWorkload:\nvery light. everything can be done the night before\n"

You see, I tried! I tried very hard to enjoy your class, professor! You explained to us the most interesting of modern physics experiments, you always explained how the concepts were relevant to everyday life; this could have even been a good CULPA review! It could have been! \nBut no, Professor. After delivering our final exam grades just hours after the test was over, you have yet to post our semester grades. It has been four weeks, Professor. I have already begun learning newer physics; the applications of what you taught me! Just the way you wanted--\nBut still, not a grade in sight!\nSincerely, \nA student \nWorkload:\nBUT WHAT GRADE\n"

Sure I got a good grade, but this class was worthless. The course material is obviously engaging and the foundation of so much physics.  Upon further investigation.. I found out that Marka has trouble keeping graduate students to work with him in research.  Here's a few reasons to describe what makes Marka so bad:\n-Poor (useless) lecture style: does not explain derivations, explains topic as if it is a review, starts talking about things that are barely examples of the phenomena\n-Poor class organization: Syllabus gets filled in on courseworks as a one word topic a few weeks after each class, spaced 2 out of 3 midterms with 2 classes in between, homeworks get handed back months later or not at all\n-Long and difficult homeworks of which the lectures are of no help, draws on concepts and ideas that you may have never been exposed to\n-\"-has no concept of how little the class understands the material, not helpful during office hours because he Doesnt Understand Questions\nhow unfortunate that a class he teaches is a requirement for so many physics majors.  to get a good grade- share homeworks, copy down the questions from the practice midterm on to your formula sheet- he uses the exact same questions and answers year after year from the practice midterms to the midterms/final\nsample of review for midterm, that he posted on courseworks two days before midterm.  In summary, teach a course by listing pages of information that students have to know:\n\" Please make sure that you understand the material covered on pages 313-331, 355-382, 413-441, 519-577 and the related problems. (pages 453-488 are recommended)\n.\nThe multiple choice and conceptual problems most likely will cover: \nA.P.French: An Introduction to Quantum Physics\n.\nSome of Chapters 1 and 2\n.\n-> Please make sure that you understand the material covered on pages 17-102 and the related problems.

We didn't get midterm grades till nearly the end of the semester, and I think I only recovered 1 or 2 of the many graded problem sets (he took forever to grade those too.)\n2. In class, Marka uses powerpoint slides a lot. This is good when you want to review material (he always posts them online) but bad because he never does the derivations for equations on the blackboard, which would have helped immensely.\n3.

The text is confusing and the homework problems are all algebra and no physics. The class got a little better once we stopped using that book, and then he hit us with this insane E&M; homework.

I had Brooijmans for 3007 and since he didn't say a sentence that wasn't in the textbook, I thought that was the worst it could get.  Then I took Marka's class and after a few weeks ended up *wishing* he'd just recite from the textbook.  The times when I actually went to class I would wait for him to explain something, but instead we would spend class time either looking at portriats of the physicists themselves, or else photographs of some experiment that used the techniques that we were supposed to be discussing.  All I ever got from him was overview.  Specifically, several of the classes later in the semester focused on irrelevant concepts: one entire class was devoted to laser safety; another class he showed only pictures of a vibrating guitar.  Worst of all, when he actually did go through the math, it was all by powerpoint presentation - he never once - EVER - wrote on the actual board - he would just click a button and the equation would magically rearrange itself into the form he wanted it in (or rather, that the textbook author wanted it in) and he left it up to you to figure out the algebra later on your own.  This is a fine technique if you are explaining principles (which, as I said before, is all he ever did), but horrible for actually teaching physics.  Here's the kicker: in the review session for the final (which was, mind you, conducted by the TA), we all finally learned how to actually *use* the dipole and multipole formulas we'd been ostensibly studying for a semester.  All the countless classes of useless talk by Prof. Marka amounted to our just being confused about what the hell was going on.  The final itself was not only a joke, but - unbelieveably - he also called on us to identify those portraits for credit!  He'd already done this on the midterm and we thought he was kidding when he said they'd be on the final - but we were wrong.\nWorkload:\nproblem sets, midterm, final\n"
