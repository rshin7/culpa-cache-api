Proffesor Sykes is incredibly warm and is very willing to help (he actually checks his emails on weekends unlike some!). Work load is not heavy, very easy to do well. Very pleasant and laid back atmosphere. The class covers a lot of intersting topics (everythign form basics of earthquakes to international mitigation to terrorism). Usefull and interesting. \nWorkload:\n5 problem sets (not too difficult--given well in advance); take- home midterm; take-home final; research paper (8 pages) due at end of year--any topic relevant to the class.\n"
