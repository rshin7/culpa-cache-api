            "review_content": "\nThis class is actually pretty doable.  Russian is hard but it's still a European langauge and has an alphabet.  That said, this class is INCREDIBLY time-\nconsuming.  There is at least 2 hours worth of homework and class preparation every night.  The tests are not easy and if you don't get an idea of the dialogue for the next days class you feel like a total moron the next day. BUT Kitson is a really, really nice guy who totally loves Russian everything and is always available to talk to outside of class.  The Slavic Languages department is so great and Kitson, while looking a little goofy and cartoonish, is a total asset.  The real point of this class is that you actually learn a lot of Russian in a very short period of time.  If you're willing to put in the time for this class, definitely do it.  \nWorkload:\nDon't get me started.... but at least you learn the language!\n"
