            "review_content": "\nIf you get Nora for your lab instructor, you should thank your lucky stars. This was her first semester, and I think she did an amazing job. She's really knowledgeable about the material and can help you out with any questions you have during lab, but she keeps her opening lecture concise, which is helpful. \nShe's also an extremely fair grader. She makes lots of useful comments and corrections on the homework, but doesn't necessarily take off points for every little mistake. \nThe best part about Nora is that she's extremely friendly and approachable (unlike some of the other lab instructors). Definitely take her section if you can.\nWorkload:\nNot too bad. Lab worksheets, a pre-lab quiz and an outline of the procedure for each class as well as two formal lab reports. One midterm (not a practical, like in the lab for Hertz's class) and one final, both reasonable if you study.\n"
