            "review_content": "\nI have just finished Professor Elmes' micro this semester, and thought I might add sth new to the existing comments.\nTo sum it up, this class is a great class with much hard work. So if you are only interested but not passionate about economics, I would recommend you to take micro from another professor. That being said, Professor Elmes is definitely the best choice for a intended econ major. She is a well-prepared and clear lecturer. She usually recommends us to read the textbook before coming to lectures, but after she explained them the concepts become much more easier to digest. She uses colored graphs, extensively explained formulas, and occasional handouts to help you understand the material in a crystal clear fashion. If you take notes systematically they will be enough for your preparation for the exams (though not for all the homework problems).\nProfessor Elmes is also very approachable. She welcomes questions in class and usually answers them with patience. There are one time or two she answered a question with haste, but that was because we were running out of time and the question was indeed somewhat stupid (she just mentioned the same concept 20 minutes ago). She takes questions in office hours as well and often strikes an interesting conversation with you.\nThe workload for this class is very big. Doing the problem sets themselves usually takes about 4-5 hours per week, but you also need to spend about 3 hours to discuss them with your study buddies. The midterm and the final are both very similar to the problem sets. So if you do all the problems carefully and review them before exams you should do pretty well. Good luck!\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets, 8 questions each. Each question contain 4-8 small questions.\nMid-term, 40%.\nFinal, 40%. Non-cumulative, only covers materials after midterm.\n\n"

Indifference Curves would be made akin to Level Curves of a surface, only to completely ignore Gradient Vectors and Directional Derivatives. The list goes on and on...\nWhat could have been very rigorous use of the concepts taken in the classes before became pedantic and otherwise myopic proofs. A burning desire to apply the deeply entrenched skills honed in the courses REQUIRED prior to this one was met with low marks - seeing the trees, not the forest, is what is tested in this class.\nOne would hope that the \"Micro\" in Microeconomics would refer to the phenomena studied, not the pedagogical method. \nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets - too much for one person to do alone, yet the only way to study for the exam. Throw the textbook out.\n2 exams, which test the ability to infer from what is taught - not the material itself. \n"

            "review_content": "\nOne of the best classes I've taken at Columbia and certainly one of the best Economics courses. \nIf you are interested in graduate school or advanced studies in economics, take this course. It requires some pure math, but at a very reasonable level- there are very few really challenging proofs in HW, nothing like you might have seen in Modern Analysis. The tests are manageable to easy (see below), the problem sets long but not too hard, and you can do them in pairs. The material itself is hard, but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nSusan Elmes' legendary teaching abilities are even more manifest in this course than in her better known intermediate micro course. She elucidates concepts and performs proofs in such a clear way that you will hardly ever be confused even by very complex material. She's also much more light hearted in the class, so it's a real treat to listen to lectures- I was often on just a couple of hours of sleep in class but never felt even the slightest bit tired or bored. \nNote: I found recitations pretty useless, since you learn the math through lectures and especially PSets, but it might be different in a different year. \nThe material is extremely interesting, because it is an economics course from a pure math point of view- everything is proven, axioms are created and challenged, and the last chapter has mathematical axioms leading to conclusions about social welfare, like Arrow's impossibility theorem and axioms behind Utilitarianism and Rawlesian theory, which to me was really mind-blowing. However, you don't learn that much that is new per se, it's mostly the same material as intermediate micro, just with a completely different methodology (much like advanced metrics). So if you're looking for fascinating new ideas and new directions in economics you hadn't explored before, and aren't really interested in advanced methodologies and thinking- this might not be for you (especially if you're allergic to proofs and higher math). \nBut otherwise- you owe it to yourself to check this out. It's a sight to see, and legitimately fun and awesome. \nWorkload:\n30%- Weekly HW and in-class problems (which are more or less weekly for the first half of the course, then almost entirely missing the second half). Expect the former to take a good 10 hours or so, and make sure to find a partner to work with. There are typically 5-6 easy or very manageable problems (hints at the back of the book are invaluable!) and 2-3 annoying or hard ones. They can be pretty cool at times, though. The in-class problems are problems which students solve on the board at the beginning of class. Usually pretty straightforward, expect to do one of these in the semester, but keep track of the solutions- they often come up on tests. \nAlso, major plus- homeworks are due on friday (9 days after being assigned)! \n30%- Midterm. In classic Elmes style, the test is very manageable (mostly computations and very short proofs you've seen before), no surprises, she tells you exactly what it'll be like\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but if you don't know what you're doing, you'll lose time where you don't need to, and that'll mess you up. So just listen carefully to what she says will be on the test and know those things solidly, and you should do great. Breadth (knowing all subjects moderately well) is more important here than depth (knowing a few subjects perfectly). \n40%- Final. Basically the same as the midterm, maybe a little easier. Non-cumulative (thank goodness). \n"

The class is essentially the micro half of Principles, but with more math. I'm honestly not sure if it was worth it if you're not an Econ major.\nThe weekly homeworks are ridiculously long. They take 5-8 hours each, and if you want to do them properly, they take even longer. You can work in groups of 3, which makes it worse since you spend so much time just to coordinate with your teammates. I ended up spending roughly 10-12 hrs/week on these.\nExams are not bad. They are often very similar to the problem set questions. The exams are however really time constrained. So practice doing problem quickly when you do the homework.\nShe's a pretty strict grader - curves to a B.\nWorkload:\n11 problem sets (1 optional): 20%\n1 midterm: 35%\n1 final: 35%\n2 quizzes in recitation: 10%\n\n"

This despite the fact that I ended up with a slightly lower grade than any of my previous econ classes (her curve is much lower, IME).\nI found the textbook entirely unnecessary (seriously, I only used it like four times all semester). Elmes' lectures were so well organized and scripted that my notes were a much more useful reference.\nHer problem sets weren't nearly as bad as I expected. Find a good partner (maybe not a trio), and you can easily get through them. I didn't find them particularly challenging or time consuming. However they were great preparation for her exams, which are EXACTLY like the problem sets.\nI found the calculus to be perfectly fine, but I'm a double major in CS (focus on machine learning), so I've probably taken a few more math based classes than many econ majors. If you aren't afraid to take a derivative, and understand why/what it means, Elmes is a great micro professor.\nWorkload:\n~Weekly problem sets, 20%. 2 essentially irrelevant quizzes, 5% each.

            "review_content": "\nThis was a very interesting class, with plenty of real world applications; the scope includes consumer theory and risk preferences, tax policy and welfare economics, several types of competitive equilibrium, and plenty of everything else in between. Professor Elmes is extremely knowledgeable in all of these areas and lectures are thorough and engaging. I rarely yawned.\nThe biggest issue with the class lies in the actual graded work - the quizzes, problem sets, and exams (surprise, I know). As mentioned, Professor Elmes gives one hell of a lecture, but in most cases, the lectures are not sufficient ammunition for the assignments. At this common juncture, most students turn to the textbook, but unfortunately, those mentioned on the syllabus do not supplement material discussed in class in a symmetrical fashion - most of the time, Perloff (author of the required textbook) goes into depth in areas that the Professor glosses over in lecture, and vice-versa. Many weeks were spent reading hours of intricately developed systems in the book, only to incorrectly apply them on homeworks and tests. \nWhat the class lacks, then, is a solid reference for the material covered (you know, that moment at 2 AM where you've typed \"concavity test for expected value of homogenous utility functions\" into Google); in short, Elmes could probably write her own economics textbook, instead of assigning one and recommending two others for additional reading. \nRecitations and office hours were helpful, but the questions asked are so nuanced that recitation needs to be coupled with several office hours each week in order to succeed here. In many cases, the TA's had as little of an idea as to what a problem asked as I did.  \nWorkload:\nHeavy. 11 Problem sets (20%), anywhere from 4 to 10 hours a week. Working in groups is permitted, and helps, but one needs to do all of the problems to prepare for exams. Two in-class quizzes (10%); nothing too crazy. Midterm and final (35% each): you're lucky if you finish on time. \n"

The class was so focused in calculus all the time that sometimes I had problem referring back to economics, consequences, etc etc. Elmes surely try to complicate every fuction, so as to you have to use advanced calculus to unwrap, derivattives, etc etc. Not really something bad, but I wish the conceptual approach was there too. I love teachers who give a lot of homework. But in her class I was mostly copying problem resolutions from the board as fast as I can so I could at home try to comprehend what I actually wrote. All classes follow the same model and it can get tiring sometimes. Her handwriting could be clear and a better introduction to derivatives would do wonders too (Nicholson's book is very straightforward too and is the book she uses/bases the pace of the class). Deep base in Calculus and knowing all about derivatives of U(x,y) is a must for this class for a start.\nWorkload:\nHeavy, but I prefer having a lot of problems and being familiar with what's asked in tests instead of surprises.

            "review_content": "\nHands down the best class I have taken at Columbia. The material in this class is much more difficult than anything you've ever had to do in your econ classes, but I couldn't imagine anyone better suited to teaching it than Susan Elmes. As other reviewers have mentioned, her ability to elucidate difficult concepts is basically unmatched and she will teach you so much. Looking back at the first couple of classes, I remember being very challenged by the material then, but a semester later I was able to easily use those concepts in new ways and apply them to the material from the later part of class.\nAs someone who took this class with the bare minimum of math (Linear Algebra + taking Analysis and Optimization concurrently) I thought that the math was challenging, but by no means impossible as she makes a point of introducing every advanced concept from mathematics, and I found myself learning a lot not just about econ but about math as well and improving my proof-writing skills immeasurably. In fact, she would often explain concepts to completion that we would go over in my Analysis and Optimization class weeks later (sort of defying the purpose of making me take that as a co-requisite...). The material in the class is basically the same as in Intermediate Micro presented in a much more generalized/abstract manner. It's not exactly the kind of material that most people want to learn because they really want to know, but there are nonetheless many interesting results that are achieved in the class and I recommend it to anyone who wants to challenge himself or improve his mathematical abilities.\n Professor Elmes will teach you a lot, she is nice and funny in class (dry sense of humour) and she will push everyone to the border of their abilities and even further, without ever being unfair. Some of the stuff she does in class is rather insane, but she doesn't ask you to reproduce proofs of similar difficulty on the exam, and it is a rather impressive testament to her knowledge of the material. She's doing insanely long, involved proofs on the board without so much as glancing at her notes as if she were doing basic arithmetic. Really quite impressive to even just watch, and probably the best professor I've had here. \nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets that can be done in groups of 2 and may take quite a bit of time (though not as insanely long as her problem sets from Intermediate Micro).\nMidterm and Final are challenging, but quite doable: both contained problems that were on the easier end of problems from the classes and homeworks. \n"

Not only does the class take up so much time (at least twice as much time as any of my other classes did), the material is very challenging and I felt constantly overwhelmed by the amount of it. In addition, Elmes covers a lot of material per lecture so it was essential to pay attention for every second of class in case it would show up later on a problem set or midterm/final. The textbook is useless, I don't think most people even bought it. \nThat being said, it is difficult to deny that Elmes is an outstanding professor. She is clear, concise, and extremely knowledgeable. Her lectures are often very interesting (I found the trade lectures to be boring but that's my preference only, others seemed to enjoy it) and she makes it easy to take notes that will be your study material for the midterm and the final. Whether the notes actually prepare you well is debatable-- the problem sets can be much more difficult than the class examples, but the midterm and final questions were not as difficult. \nOverall, I think this is an important class to take. As head of the Economics department, Elmes clearly knows her subject material, is a great lecturer, and is also a pretty nice person. However, be prepared for late nights and a lot of self-doubt in your abilities as an economics student. Also, free up all your Tuesday evenings, nights and sometimes Friday mornings.\n\nWorkload:\n*VERY* heavy. Weekly problem sets, you can work in groups up to 3 but I highly recommend you do all the questions anyway because the questions on the midterm/final are similar. 20%\nMidterm.  Very challenging, a lot of people looked pretty shaken up after... 30%\nFinal. Easier than midterm but not by much. 50%\nCurved to a B I think. \n"

            "review_content": "\nTouted as one of the most sought-after yet demanding professors to teach Microeconomics, Susan Elmes' reputation precedes her. Although she has an intense and perhaps over-confident persona and commands attention in the classroom, she is approachable - even almost grandmotherly, as classmates of mine have described her. Although many students do prosper with her highly dogmatic style of lecture, I happen to be in the camp that flounders with such a prescribed learning format. \nDespite her rigorous and thorough class instruction, Elmes' lectures do not adequately prepare you for her problem sets. While the examples demonstrated in class are sufficient for the tests, the problem sets are significantly more challenging. Often times, the problem sets will test material that has only been glibly and hastily taught...  In many other classes - especially in the hard sciences - the textbook is the primary source from which you are able to decipher exactly what your barely cogent non-english speaking professor is expostulating. In Microeconomics, however, the lecture notes are the sole resource available to you as a student in Elmes' class. Thus, you will encounter much difficulty in completing the problem sets, especially on areas Elmes' skims over in lecture, with the expectation that the Gods of Economics (or Google) will miraculously install this knowledge into your brain. \nAs a student enrolled in Xavier's Macroeconomics and Elmes' Microeconomics simultaneously, I would also like to point out the disparity in workloads. Realistically, I spent around 4-5 times the total number of hours I spent studying Macroeconomics in Elmes' Microeconomics. It's curious why one is so much more academically rigorous than the other if they should be analogs of each other...\nAll in all, Elmes' is a great teacher but her problem sets are certainly unrealistic in their expectations.

She draws LOTS of graphs, and uses many colors of chalk. The lectures are mostly examples, and you're supposed to learn how to do problems in general off of those. Sometimes it's possible, sometimes it's really difficult. The lectures don't always relate to the homework.\nAlso, be sure your question makes sense, is pertinent to the topic at hand, and hasn't been answered before you ask it, because Professor Elmes will NOT hesitate to throw you down. A student once asked a question, and she gave him two reasons why it wasn't a relevant question, and then told him that even if it was relevant, it was still pretty much a stupid question. It was the classroom equivalent of getting dunked on. She was good humored about it though.\nShe had plenty of recitation sections, in which TAs did problems similar to what would be seen in the problem sets.\nThe exams and quizzes weren't always fair. Sometimes she would throw things on the exam to see who would really understand how to do problems in general. I consider this unfair, however, because she never wrote general cases down in class, and the book didn't do a very good job either. Standard Columbia curve: half the class gets at least a B+.\nAnd of course, the thing Elmes is most famous for: the longest problem sets in the university. Each problem set has between 8 to 10 problems, split at minimum a-d, and usually going through at least g. And each subproblem usually has two, three, or four subproblems. And lots of graphs. You get to work in groups of three, which normally results in each person taking 1/3 of the problems.

            "review_content": "\nI would vote Susan Elmes as the best professor that I've had this year, and I have had some great professors this year (some with gold nuggets on culpa).  First of all, Prof Elmes' lectures are always extremely clear.  She teaches so that you don't actually need to read the book (even though she might tell you to) - everything you need to know and understand from Intermediate Micro, you can get from the lectures.  She might present ideas that are abstract, but then she will always take you through examples that show you exactly how to approach a problem.  Then, she will stop to ask for questions and will pretty much answer all of them.  That said, classes, while not entertaining, actually ARE interesting and will keep you focused, because 1) the material is clearly presented,  2) Prof. Elmes engages the students by both asking and answering questions, and 3) she will make funny jokes from time to time.\nBesides the lectures, other aspects of the class are also very well-structured.  Prof. Elmes is very approachable during office hours, which she has every week.  Also, she regularly gives handouts in class that make note-taking a lot easier, and she always makes sure to post these handouts, homework assignments, and homework solutions on Courseworks.  The recitations are also very, very helpful in doing the problem sets.  In other words, yes, this class might be more challenging than the other Micro section, but I think it's definitely worth it, simply because Prof. Elmes is an amazing lecturer, and she makes sure that you have all the support and resources that you need to do well in her class - you just need to be willing to put in the work.\nTo that end, I disagree with all the previous reviews that were somewhat negative.  I've really enjoyed Intermediate Micro and have learned an incredible amount of economics from it.  Yes, I did stay up until 4:00 a.m. once because of a problem set, but ultimately, I put in all the necessary work and did very well.  This is not a class that you should shy away from - in fact, I would say that you should go out of your way to have Intermediate Micro with Prof. Elmes.\nP.S. If you want to save money, seriously, don't buy the book, because you really don't need it.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets that you have ten days to complete in groups of up to three people; two 20-minute quizzes that are very basic and very easy; midterm; final that's not cumulative\n"

She has an exceptional grasp of her subject; I never once saw her make a mistake in class, she's very, VERY competent and on top of her material.  Quizzes and exams I felt were very fair.\nHowever, the one big complaint was the homework.  The problems sets are STUPIDLY long and involved; I'd say they actually detract from learning.  It wasn't uncommon to spend between 6 and 8 hours per week on them, and much of that time was chasing down minute details that never showed up again and didn't really assist learning.  Most of the PS are 6 questions, with multiple parts; making them less involved/complex, or cutting it down to 4 questions per week would fix this I think.  As it was, I spent so much time rushing to finish the details that I actually didn't have the time I wanted to focus on some of the fundamentals, and this hurt me on exams.  Prof. Elmes, please consider, we do have other classes besides yours!\nWorkload:\nVery high, problem sets are long and complicated to the point of being stupid, Exams are fair but very challenging under the time constraints, both the final and the midterm felt as though they were about 1 question too long.

Elmes is a solid teacher, and by that I mean that she explains stuff clearly so that you don't have to go read the book. If you pay attention and take good notes, you will do fine.\nSomeone mentioned before that the class was repetitive; it definitely is. We learn the two first order conditions the first class, and we basically apply them again throughout the course. The problems sets were long, but they weren't too difficult, and since everyone gets to work in groups of 3, one of your groupmates should get it, and if not then ask somebody else.\nThe midterm was long and a little difficult, but it's nothing that bad. Again, everything was covered before. I actually misread a problem and messed up on it, so I was kicking myself at the end. The final was ridiculously easy. I mean, Elmes gave out a data sheet that said that around 30% got a 90 or above without the scale. The median was in the 80s; that's pretty high for an economics class.\nI ended up getting a solid A without doing much work, except paying attention in class and working on the problem sets for about an hour or two a week (and the last few I slacked big time). Maybe Elmes has changed, but this class was definitely a lot easier than I expected, and overall, it was a very good course.\nWorkload:\nLong and annoying Problem sets1 long, semi-difficult midterm1 2-hour easy final\n"

The book teaches you concepts but you dont' want concepts you want help! and the only help you're gonna get is by paying attention in her lecture.  In the lecture she explains how to do problems ACTUAL: economic problems.  Her recitations are the only way to be able to do the problem sets if your'e a type 2 person.

That said, it will be very difficult -- class itself is interesting but very intense and she covers daunting amounts of material in each class. Problem sets take several hours to complete and are graded and count for 25% of your grade. The midterm is the most difficult exam I have ever taken as you are forced to do difficult problems in a very short period of time. The final is difficult but time is less of an issue as you have slightly more time to finish the exam. Curve is somewhat stiffer than most classes for two reasons - 1. She curves more to a B than to a B+ as many other teachers do and 2. The kids who choose to take her class are typically of higher quality as it is understood that she is the better/more challenging professor (there is always another professor who teaches micro simultaneously). So, though you may not get an A, you will learn an enormous amount about Microeconomics which will prepare you well for future courses. It all depends on what matters more to you....\nALSO, make sure to go to recitation.\nWorkload:\nWeekly, time-consuming problem sets (25%). Very difficult midterm (35%).

Admittedly, sometimes there are variations (there could be two curves! sometimes you have to work backwards!).  But that was THE ENTIRE CLASS: solving the same exact problem, over and over and over and over again...in the extremely long problem sets...in the extremely long midterm and exam...and in the lectures, with her combative style of teaching.  If you can figure out how to do this one problem (and you'll have many chances to practice), the only difficulty of this course will be getting all of those problem sets done on time.  But if you can't, go to recitations: the TAs all but do the problem set for you (often, only the numbers are different).

The second does not easily extend one concept into new areas, gets to know the TAs and recitation times very well, may not see a connection between economics and real life, and has to study for many hours in order to manage exams.\nIf you are of the first type (as I would consider myself), Susan Elmes' lectures will be the highlight of your day--and your week. If you are of the second type, this course will make you want to cry. And if you're somewhere in between, then so be it for your reaction.\nNo one will contest that Elmes is quite possibly Columbia's most talented lecturer. Her presentations of the material are more carefully scripted than a political stump speech, and better-executed at that. She never misses a beat and never, ever loses her place or gets confused. She understands this material better than any of her students know arithmetic. And if you hate that person who likes to ask stupid questions, argue with professors, or question their conclusions, then you'll be amazed when Elmes, without even taking a moment to re-think her argument, will *take* *them* *down*.\nBut for the second-type people, it's important to know that her explanations are sufficient and thorough, but if you are not the type to thoroughly understand material immediately, you may get lost once she has moved on expecting that you're all set. Don't expect any help from the book; it is completely conceptual, a stark contrast to her highly quanitative lectures. The problem sets are often longer than other professors assign in similar classes, and will frequently ask you to use your brain a bit and extend the class discussion to think about new problems--again, not much of a problem for type 1s, but a source of major frustration (and recitation attendance) among type 2s. And the exams--they're tough. In my class, no more than 5% of the class even had time to completely finish the midterm.\nIf you're not sure if you're a type 1 or a type 2, then go for Elmes. I can't guarantee it'll be easy, but I can definitely guarantee you will not be bored in lecture, and you'll probably even learn a thing or two even despite your best intentions. You'll also forevermore go to other classes wishing that every Columbia lecturer met the gold Elmesian standard which you, as a naive freshman, had once thought would be the norm at an Ivy League institution.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets--expect to take about 150 to 200% of the time that you would normally allot for a problem set in an econ class--and a midterm and final, both challenging and lengthy but fair and representative of the lecture materials covered\n"

I've had her the last 2 semester for Principles and Micro, and some of the stuff that people have said is downright inaccurate.  To characterize her behavior as \"ridiculously cartoonish,\" as the most recent reviewer has done, is absurd; hell, I don't even know what that means!  To call her arrogant is also unfair.  I would instead say that she's extremely confident in her teaching, which she should be: no one is in as much control of the class as Susan is.  What's more,  she is the clearest, savviest, most organized, and best lecturer that I've so far encountered in my time at Columbia.  She's also funny (in a slightly sarcastic way) and more than willing to answer students' questions--as stupid as some inevitably are.  Here's the catch: the problem set's are INCREDIBLY long and difficult.  My best advice to anyone taking her class is to work in a group (with smart people, if you can) and always attend recitation.  More about the problem sets: they are usually mathematically based, they DO often require obscure maneuvering, and the book will not help.  HOWEVER, both Susan (or Elmsy, as my friend and I like to call her...not to her face, of course) and the TAs are very willing to meet with you, and they post  solutions that are more detailed and helpful than anything you've ever seen (occassionally over 10 pages).  Study these solutions well!  One last note about the class: the 4 TAs are great.  Special props to Regina Almeyda Duran for being an incredible TA; if she's there again next semester, and you need help with the material, go to her.  \nWorkload:\n10-11 (HARD) problem sets, 1 (HARD) Miderm, 1 (slightly easier) Final\n"
