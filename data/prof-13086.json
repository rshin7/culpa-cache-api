He did nothing to prepare us for the class, seemed to have no clue what Saliba was teaching, and had no idea what was on the exam. He never gave us our curved midterm grades and gave us no review material. The other TA's apparently expanded upon Saliba's lectures and gave study guides. But not Kenan. Kenan sent us two sentences with the format of the exam the night before. In class he mumbled at the board for half the semester until he realized that if he just had us discuss in groups, he wouldn't have to do any work. It was truly the most pointless hour of my week and the most productive thing I did in that class was write a paper for another class. Avoid Kenan if you can.\nWorkload:\nWeekly reflections on the reading. Possibly graded, probably not. We never received feedback or a grade.\n"
