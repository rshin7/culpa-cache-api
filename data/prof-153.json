His heavy analytic style may be a little bit frightening in that he mostly talks about ideas and arguments by organizing them in steps, which makes the entire thing a little less \"fun\" and a little more rigorous. However, he is an engaging lecturer, has a great accent, and is very helpful during office hours. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone unsure about whether to take it. You will finish with a very solid foundation in philosophical content and style.\nWorkload:\nLight. He posts a lot of readings but you don't necessarily have to read them to understand the lectures or do well on the tests. \n3 homework assignments that didn't take very long (they have to be less than a page in length or he won't accept them).\n1 midterm\n1 final\n1 final paper 5-7 pages\n"

The only time when time will not be an issue is when Professor Collins recalls a witty story or a philosophy joke, and will undoubtably end up telling it. Although the stories and jokes may end with silence, his lectures are, more often than not, very funny. As stated in the previous post, you will see No! on your returned papers, at least if you write philosophy papers of the same poor quality as I do, but the grading is fair. \nIf you are new to philosophy, as I was, do not expect an easy transition into the subject, the first topic was time travel. If you have never experienced an extreme level of confusion, so extreme that you may be convinced you have just suffered a stroke, you will when you read a philosopher's explanation of time travel. You will also never be able to enjoy Back to the Future ever, ever, again. \nOccasionally the link to the assigned readings will not work and the notes will not be posted, just bring it up to him before or after lecture and it will get fixed. I do not recommend emailing him.\n\nWorkload:\n4 short papers, 400 word max; Final paper 5-7 pages; Mid-term shocked a few people, Final was the same format. I highly recommend you do all of the assigned readings, especially in preparation for the mid-term and final.\n"

In Epistemology, Collins could actually get to know each and every one of us, and he was honestly interested.  It's a tough subject to master, but he went clearly and methodically through every subject, making sure everyone got what was going on.\nIf you are a fan of syllabi and structure and knowing exactly what's on the exam, this is not the professor for you.  Our \"syllabus\" was a list of topics that he wanted to get to at some point.  He writes his exams the morning of the test, and if you ask him what's on it he will honestly tell you that he doesn't know.  If that bothers you, don't take a class with Collins.\nIf you're a fan of philosophy and really thinking critically, this is the class for you.\nThis is the kind of class that will keep you up at night, not because you're in butler studying but because you're lying in bed thinking about that days lecture and wondering if we know anything at all.\n\nWorkload:\nMidterm, final, both very easy if you went to class.

He is hilarious, he goes through the material slowly and clearly, he makes everything and anything interesting, and he responds so thoughtfully on-the-spot. If you take this class, go to the lectures and you will forever see the world differently. (I still talk about a lot of the material to anyone who will listen.)\nOn the second point: he is so unbelievable lazy. He writes his tests the morning of (for a 9 AM class); the upside of this is that if you go to his office hours the day before, you know exactly what topics will be on the midterm/final. He flees the scene after class, and I once saw a student catch him before he left and ask to set up special office hours (because he had class during the regular office hours) and Collins told the student to email him. \"I have emailed you,\" said the student. \"Email me again,\" Collins said. \"I have,\" the student said. \"I've emailed you three times now.\" Collins was just kind of quiet for a second, and then he looked at the kid and said \"Well you've really got me in a corner,\" and then walked out of the classroom. I have never seen a teacher so shamelessly avoid work.\nI would definitely recommend this class: both what he teaches and what he does will provide you material to talk about for many years.\nWorkload:\nNo work. Literally, there is almost no work. Weekly homework assignments that take ten minutes. A midterm and a final (easy if you've gone to class).\nIf you're only taking four classes in a semester and this is one of them, then you are a lazy alcoholic college student, because this class is no work.\n"

            "review_content": "\nOh well well, where to start? First of all, I enjoyed Collins's lectures. He is hilarious, fairly articulate, and structured compared to a lot of other lecturers in the philosophy department. He would proclaim in his very first lecture that he would grade harshly. That is not true - median in midterm is a clear cut B+, which is a standard Columbia curve. Despite the nature of this course as an introduction to philosophy, Collins spends most of his time talking about epistemology and logic but barely touches on ethics or more literature oriented philosophy. And he admits it himself. While this is understandable because a serious philosopher does not give a damn to what other philosophers say, you should definitely think again if this course is really for you. He sort of has a skeleton of which topics he will talk about, but he follows it loosely. Quite a few lectures seem to be of what's going on in his mind on that particular day. Having said, he talks about stuff that is not unheard of, which allows you take on some new perspective and help clarify some stereotypes. That is the good part. Midterm and final are in the same format, around fifteen short response questions, covering everything in class. Questions are very standard, not testing on your philosophical talent, but just how much attention you've paid to his lectures. If you manage to take notes diligently and copy down every words that spit out of his mouth, you have a good shot to ace the exams. That is the sweet part. One thing could potentially disturb some people is that a lot of arguments tend to be directed towards Collins's understanding. This might not be the most ideal scenario since this course is supposed to introduce philosophical argument but not to reassure opinions. But again, a serious philosopher can't stand a second opinion, let alone to teach one. Overall, Collins is really sharp and not arrogant (not sure if he is approachable though). His lectures are insightful and worth listening but don't expect a smooth or very structured lecture series.\nWorkload:\nfour 400-word assignments but somehow winded up to 7 in the end; One 7-15 page paper which is based on his lectures; readings close to none; one manageable midterm and final.

But it stops there.  As a professor for Probability and Decision Theory he was completely negligent and indifferent about the class.

He posted them the DAY BEFORE the final\n- he often came to class and realized he was unprepared to teach things that he was planning on teaching\n- he held a review session for the final (what a saint!) but everyone was so confused about what they should even ask him that he wound up just teaching some new concepts\n- his grading had to have been very arbitrary...I thought I must have failed both the midterm and final but still got an A- for the semester.

In fact, the only way that one can sum up the absurdity of this course is to look at the absurdity of the professor. Collins exhibits unexpected strengths and unexpected weaknesses. The most apparent thing about Collins is his utter lack of professionalism. This lack manifests itself in many way including but not limited to: the notable absence of any syllabus that actually tells you what you are going to learn in the course (for the trolls out there, know that there is a 'listing of readings and assignments' but it is updated as we go which means you never know where the course is headed), Collins' utter rejection of the idea that he needs to put any of the topics we discuss in context (i.e., so that you could see where a particular debate fits in to the larger field of philosophy), and the lack of a grading rubric, a set number of assignments, or a description of how much each assignment will affect one's grade. In my opinion, Columbia professors should be allowed to teach their classes as they wish provided they meet certain a criteria of professionalism which Collins simply does not possess nor demonstrates any desire in possessing. This unprofessionalism leads to all sorts of frustrations from not knowing how you are doing in the course to being bullied in class for offering an opinion that is wrong and (in Collins' opinion) stupid.\nSo now that we have gotten why you should not take this class out of the way, let me pander to those who really love Collins so that we can really understand why this professor is so contentious.\nDespite all of his unprofessionalism, Collins does do a tremendous job of stimulating debate. Be warned, however, that this is not meaningful debate. Collins likes to talk about what redness is or whether it is possible for two objects to be located in the same space. These questions are not interesting because they have no impact (or potential impact) on our world. Despite their lack of importance, the questions do have a way of teaching you to be a good critical thinker and a good debater. Collins is capable of describing a number of good argumentative techniques that will be genuinely helpful to you in the future. This is why some may enjoy Collins. If you can set aside the pointlessness of the class and the lack of professionalism and simply focus on perfecting one's argumentative skills, then you may enjoy this class.\n*breath*\nNow, on the other hand, Jon Lawhead is an absolute joy. The man was empathetic with the fact that we had to suffer through this joke of a class, he answered our questions in a clear, consistent, and comprehendible way, and he was totally approachable. Everything good in TA can be found in Jon, and I recommend that you try to be in his section anytime he is in a class.\nWorkload:\nOkay so this is probably useless because there is no way of saying whether this workload will be the same next time Collins teaches this class, and there is no way to say how much he weighted each of these things but here it goes:\n4 400 word assignments (he originally said there could be up to 7 of these) on questions that Collins thinks up after a given lecture of his choice\nMidterm\n5 page essay on either a question he gives or a topic of your choice if you are into that kind of thing\nFinal\n"

If you sat through more or less stale history of philosophy courses you'll find the hands-on experience a welcome change.

Yes, it's a solid intro class and Collins is ridiculous and very funny, but you'll walk out wondering what exactly it was that you actually learned.

With that said, the work load is INSANELY light, with 3-4 400-word maximum assignments about whatever random philosophical question/concept he decides to test you on.  Another upside is that there is almost never any required reading, but these both come with the additional downside that you have no idea what exactly to study for the midterm or final unless you took supremely copious notes on whatever was spewing from his mouth during lecture. So take notes. Diligently. Regardless of all the above facts, his grading seems to be totally arbitrary, so just ask smart questions (he loves being challenged) and hope that he likes you.

While this was humorous and engaging, I should have taken those reviews more seriously and dropped the course as quickly as I could.  Being a Phil major and having taken Phil courses before, I was extremely frustrated with Collins's teaching style and his lack of coherency.  Philosophy to begin with is a difficult subject to comprehend, but Collins often made it near impossible.  While his lectures could be funny at times, his humor did not make up for his rambling.  Collins is obviously a brilliant man, but his teaching is simply not clear.  I was looking forward to learning in depth about philosophical argumentation, but instead, I walked away from his class knowing hardly any more than I did when I walked in.

So don't be disappointed when you find that a 'cool' thought you just shared wasn't entertained by the professor because it didn't make any sense.\nConcerning time-travel, Collins tries to tell you a coherent story about time travel to show you how there is no conceptual contradiction. So, yes, there are many arguments and Collins is meticulous about the logic, but a huge part of what the course is supposed to do is to teach you the proper methods of making arguments and prepare you for further study in philosophy. Collins also shares with you some infamous argumentation flaws in the history of philosophy.\nThe class is difficult, but regardless of the grade you get, if you try hard, you will leave with a better understanding of what an argument is and a clearer mind.

So don't be disappointed when you find that a 'cool' thought you just shared wasn't entertained by the professor because it didn't make any sense.\nConcerning time-travel, Collins tries to tell you a coherent story about time travel to show you how there is no conceptual contradiction. So, yes, there are many arguments and Collins is meticulous about the logic, but a huge part of what the course is supposed to do is to teach you the proper methods of making arguments and prepare you for further study in philosophy. Collins also shares with you some infamous argumentation flaws in the history of philosophy.\nThe class is difficult, but regardless of the grade you get, if you try hard, you will leave with a better understanding of what an argument is and a clearer mind. I felt it was just what an intro to philosophy class should have been.\nWorkload:\n7-8 written assignments which required much thinking. Midterm, final: both very fair, i.e. do your work and understand the material and you will be fine.\n"

As Collins explained early on in the course, he was once known as \"the man\" thorughout campus because he taught the philosophy class with no homework, no reading, etc.  He decided to add a few \"written assignments\" and some light reading to scare away students who just wanted an easy class and to make the class size bearable.  It worked, and we had a great class with great discussion (and still not too much work, although I gladly would've done more for the class as I had a good time).  Don't enter the class hoping to learn about Plato, Kant, etc.  This class is about actually BEING a philosopher - making arguments, using logic, etc.  There is a lot of class discussion, but you can talk as much or as little as you want.  Collins said he was a tough grader at the beginning of the course.  He later sort of admitted that he was trying to scare people off, but that we really shouldn't worry that much because we seemed like an above average class anyway and should expect better grades.  I think he is a tougher grader than most, but not terrible.  Some of my friends, who I thought would get A's, got B+'s, but I felt I had earned an A, and he gave me one, so I can only assume he's a fair grader.  Collins is really funny and makes class fun.  The first day of class, he just read us this huge short story by Robert Heinlein about time travel, and then we argued about it for a few weeks.  It was a blast.\nMy only complaint about the class was sometimes I felt like Collins didn't give us the full story on certain topics and stated things that he merely believed to be true as fact. However, in a class about philosophizing, it's hard to expect your professor to give you arguments he doesn't believe in with a straight face, so I can't hold it against him.\nOverall, I would highly recommend the class.  It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot about philosophical thinking.  In fact, I might major in philosophy, partly due to this class.\nWorkload:\n5 or 6 \"written assignments,\" which were like 400 words each.  However, they were pretty tough, you had to think hard, and he graded them tough.  That said, he admitted that a 7 on the homework would not translate to a 70% in the class.  We had to read one short \"book,\" Berkeley's Three Dialogues, and a brief thing by Plato.  Not much reading either.  Midterm and final, some of it restating stuff from class and some of it applying logic to new problems.\n"

            "review_content": "\n  Simply put, many Philosophy majors left Symbolic Logic with very mixed feelings about Professor Collins.  I tried to talk to as many students as I could before writing this review, and will try to stick to the consensus, although it does seem to me to be much the same as my personal opinion.\n  Professor Collins has a killer sense of humor and is an engaging lecturer.  I could imagine many Porfessors under whom the course could easily become another dry, bureaucratic hurdle for those students who don't have a peculiar affinity for First Order Language.  I don't think that telling any of his jokes over CULPA will demonstrate the robust flavor of Collins' quick and playful wit, and so I suppose that you'll have to trust that he, better than any Professor I've had yet, is able to get an entire class of us aspiring intellectuals to erupt in giggles and knee-slaps.\n  There were problems, however.  For one, Professor Collins does not seem able to make Symbolic Logic intelligible to the uninitiated undergrad.  He will rarely stray from the formal definitions of terms, and tends to misinterpret or not comprehend at all even the simplest of student questions--unless they are posed using the language of FOL flawlessly.  The students, understanding the posed question better than the Professor, often had to act as interpreters in order to clarify issues we all would have liked to ask about, if only we knew how to properly phrase our questions.  Collins has an impressively lucid understanding of the material (which is a good thing), but simply cannot convey it very well.    For example, during one of the most difficult lectures of the course, which happened to be perhaps the most important, he wrote an incredibly involved sentence (for a definition of truth-value in FOL).  The class was immediately baffled.  Sensing this, Collins said (perhaps 90% sincerely), \"Look, the first thing to do is to realize that this all makes sense.\"  That one, I believe, got the biggest laugh of the semester.\n  There were other problems.  Hardly anyone ever saw either of the two midterms after they had been graded.  I tried to email Collins in order to see and go over my midterm, and I never heard back.  Collins only posted the first six of ten homework scores online, though he promised all ten before the final exam, and after digging through a drawer in the Philosophy Department's office, I found that online five of my assignments had been graded and returned to me.  This was particularly problematic for the students, given that the average homework grade was around 70%--we never got to find out what we'd done wrong.    Most baffling of all, I think that the undergraduates and graduate students were all graded on the same curve.  Now, I'm not 100% sure of this, but all evidence points there; for example, some undergraduates had unknowingly signed up for the graduate section of the course, but Collins told them that since the grading standards were exactly the same, it didn't really matter.  Maybe I shouldn't be so upset over this, but it does seem odd that my exams were subjected to the same grading standards as my TA from another philosophy course, who told me later that she'd already taken a Logic course like this one as an undergraduate, and that Collins' course was just a review. \nWorkload:\nThere are homework assignments given almost every week, and they take anywhere from twenty minutes to six hours to finish.  They are graded with unbridled wrath on the part of the TAs, but I think that in the end Collins may have curved the homework grade.  The two midterm exams and final exam are pretty difficult, often involving content not gone over before.  That is, if you're like me, you might flex your brain for ten hours of study for each exam, arrive at the exam, and still not have much of a clue what some questions are asking of you.\n"

Some of the homework and exam questions definitely gave math majors an advantage, but overall, he's pretty fair.  One complaint about Collins: he really is not very organized.  Lectures rarely matched with the reading, which was somewhat of a nightmare since our book is impossible to understand.  Also, don't ever expect to get your homework back within a reasonable time frame (if you get it back at all without him losing it).

And sadly, many of the students in this huge class were first-years--many of whom that experience with Collins discouraged from seeking a philosophy major. Granted, there was a small batch of kids who were constantly tossing shameless praise and innocently curious \"philosophical\" questions Collins' way, but everybody I ever spoke to in that class (at least, of the two-thirds or so who regularly showed up) was as unenthused and turned-off as I. \"Progress\" during each hour-and-fifteen-minutes proved itself a concept apparently foreign to Collins; you could show up forty minutes late and he'd still musing self-contentedly about the same damn topics. In every class, it was quite obvious that Collins was just talking off the top of his head, except toward the end of the semester when he adopted a strangely avid and hurried attitude (which left me wondering what he was ever trying to accomplish in the first place). But for god's sake, in that case, couldn't the man at least have had some compelling philosophical topics sitting there on the top of his severely ponytailed, prematurely balding head? Admittedly, occasional amusements would present themselves in the form of convoluted (and obviously intended-to-amuse) philosophical \"examples\" and quotes. (For instance: \"Man, Mother Theresa was a selfish bitch,\" used to illustrate egoism; also, an ebullient declaration of \"I've got tenure!\" used for no apparent reason at all.)

            "review_content": "\nFirst of all, there is no reading and no papers for this course, which is definately an awesome thing, but there are annoying consequences. 1) you have to either show up to every class or get good notes from someone who does and 2) your grade is comprised of the midterm, final, and your postings on the class' discussion board--a stupid component of the class, since he never lets you know what separates a good posting from a bad one and never grades them until the end. as a result, while you don't have to do much at all for this class, what you do have to do is so ambiguous that you could screw it up and not even know. the lectures vary from fun and interesting to awful, since collins does not prepare before class and often confuses himself while trying to figure out what he means to teach. the topics are arranged like improv comedy-he chooses the first one and from there he goes on tangents. in the end, you come out learning some interesting things, but suprisingly little since without reading and/or organization on his part you don't cover much ground.\nWorkload:\nno reading, no papers, a minimum of five postings on the class discussion board, most of which range from 1/2 page to 2 pages. it's hard to find a class with less of a workload\n"

            "review_content": "\nJohn Collins is, to say the least, a unique man. His lecture style is random and disconnected, and you get the sense that he's telling private jokes to himself as he chuckles his way through the classes. For those who like structure, a syllabus, and any sense of the importance of what one is studying, this class is not for you. Professor Collins enjoys making things up as he goes along and going off on endless tangents, and yet it's hard not to enjoy it: he certainly knows his stuff and covers interesting topics, whatever they end up being. However, the unpredictability and confused nature of the course makes it very frustrating at times to follow his logic or stay awake. But, overall it is an enjoyable elective and provides some good food for thought.\nWorkload:\nAbsolutely none, well, almost. The only requirement was to post 5 messages to a class discussion board, responding to any philosophical issues one chooses. Also a midterm and a final that are a breeze if one understands the major concepts of the class.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis is basically Intro to Philosophy. Collins taught it very well. Although he didn't follow a fixed syllabus and let the course progress naturally through discussion (but not completely arbitrarily; he did have the big bullet-points in mind), he explained the ideas very clearly and repeated each of them at least three times. He lectured on interesting and representative problems in different topics in philosophy, which I found highly inspiring. And they really gave me a taste of what philosophy is really like.\nWorkload:\nMinimal. Each of us was supposed to post at least 5 messages on the bulletin board (not that 5 messages is a lot of work) but I don't think he actually bothered to count. Since he repeated the materials many times and since the exams were extremely easy, even attendance wasn't that important if a student was just in for the credits.\n"

Complicated and esoteric problems in metaphysics find realization in simple, ordinary examples (time travel, clones, severed feet) that will have you arguing with Collins, your neighbor and (when you get home) your mother. Light readings too; this is not a history class. The readings are narrow, extremely dense, and to the point. And for the illiterate, he recounts all the arguments in class anyway. One complaint: the annoying kid in the front row who asks too many questions gets way too much airtime. Collins is not brutal; he's jovial. Watch out for the second paper. He always falls way behind (due to annoying kid) and the last paper is practically assigned the day before the final.\nWorkload:\ntwo papers that really challenge you to say something more than simple regurgitation (though that will do too) and an in class final.\n"
