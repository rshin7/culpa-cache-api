            "review_content": "\nNOT A JOKE CLASS!  Actual class time is a lot of fun, filled with drum circles, rhythmic excersizes and music analysis, but the assignments are brutal.  It says that no pre-recs are needed, but one class in dance, and a little music background would be extremely helpful (and near impossible without).  Gilles is very patient, and open to anything that is creative, and generally appreciates effort, even if you have zero technical ability.  Grades seem pretty arbitrary, and its clear from week one who his favorite is.  Over all, a great class to audit, or if you have a light workload in your other classes... forces you to get over fears of preforming infront of your peers, and creating original material, both dance and music.   \nWorkload:\nwow.  first paper was 8 pages, midterm was a large creation of writing, music, dance, and even a picture, took about 10-13 hours of prep time, another huge collaberation assignemnt, and then a large final project. hands down spent more time on this class than any other, ever before, and I'm a senior\n"
