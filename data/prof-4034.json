            "review_content": "\nThere is 1 pre-req for this class and it's Signals and Systems. That class didn't help at all. Undergrads who have to take this class--my heart goes out to you. You are in for one hell of a ride. A lot of the class is, what I perceive, as high level stats and other math. I really had a hard time understanding the details of the course and could only grasp vague concepts. Luckily, things are matlab based and not proof based--it is possible to work things through since the class is application based. However, the theory behind things went over my head and I found myself either dozing off of just simply confused. \nThe exams were tailored from apparently the reading but if you knew the questions from the practice exam and the general concepts from the slides, you were set. Exam difficulty is easy to medium. Grading seemed pretty fair to me. \nThe professor is very amiable and I found him easy to talk to. He is responsive to student workloads and requests. He also explains things well when asked. \nThe TA (Jason) was generally helpful but sometimes had difficulty communicating the difficult concepts to my undergraduate brain. Also, there is only 1 TA for some reason and he holds 1 hr of office hours per week. This is a very small window to get your questions answered so good luck on that field. Again, things are matlab based so that's good. My suggestion to you is divide and conquer the homework. There are one or two questions all with a couple of tasks. Divide the workload and work together. \nRemember--most of the class is graduate students. The lectures will be tailored to them but Professor Sajda is definitely someone who remembers being an undergrad and how stressful it can be. I found him to be understanding and this eased the course stress (despite the confusing material)\nWorkload:\nuHWK: 8 total, one a week. 10 hours each unless you go to Office Hours. Pretty much all Matlab. \nExam: 1 midterm\nFinal Project: Work in a group of 4 to tackle a signal processing issue. He gave us a data set and told us to turn it into readable data. Best project gets a prize. Grading seemed pretty lenient. \nGrading: 40% Homework 30% Midterm 30% Final Project. Not sure if curve exists\n"

            "review_content": "\nThere are an astonishingly few pre-requisites listed for this course. More on this later.\nIn Sajda's Signal Processing and Modeling (SPAM) class, you learn all about the mathematical concepts used for processing and modeling biosignal data. In a nutshell, Sajda goes over the basic theories and methodologies he uses largely in the context of his own biomedical research. He is approachable and knowledgeable and is a leader in the field of brain signal imaging and analysis. He holds a patent for a brain cap with electrodes and uses it in his research to sense what people are thinking\u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is a fascinating field. Columbia is lucky to have him.\nBut about the course: BMEN E4420 is a graduate-level course with many PhD students largely from the EE and BME departments, many of whom have advanced statistical knowledge (beyond our pitiful W1211) and taken advanced signals classes (Signals and Systems and DSP). With this as a required class for the few biomedical signals/imaging undergrads in the BME department, we were constantly encountered new content that built upon completely foreign topics. One would attend class with absolutely zero knowledge on the topics covered and leave class with zero net gain. This would happen regularly. Often, something would be covered in this class and a week later would be covered in Signals and Systems (ELEN E3801). This made Signals slightly easier, but SPAM would continue to be a crapshoot. I later discovered that this class was originally offered in the spring, AFTER we were to have had taken Signals and Systems. It is unclear why we had the fortune of taking in the fall this year.\nThis course departs from the standard regimen of lecture classes with a meeting once a week, a different topic covered during each lecture. A typical class would have 3 hours allotted but usually ended 30 minutes early with a short break (10-15 min) in the middle of class. He assigns readings for each week consisting of textbook chapters that are long and not helpful for the homeworks but handy for the midterm. This material is complicated. Luckily he posts the slides before class and they are very helpful for when you finally sit down with your study group to do the assignment (no study group? find one, you're going to need one).\nHomeworks are a bulk of the grading for this course and often involve using MATLAB to recreate the plots and models he has in his slides, with Sajda providing data sets and me and my partners dissecting the slides for anything pertinent. He tends to provide equations or basic MATLAB pseudocode and makes the assignment getting that code to work. I'm pretty sure each assignment took us easily 6+ hours of blank staring and trial and error. It's a good idea to have at least someone go to office hours, so that at least you'll know where the assignment is headed. Otherwise, you can spend hours in a state of confusion. This was the class that made me realize I had to give up at least one day in the weekend purely for schoolwork. It is a blessing that the homework was graded quite leniently.\nSo from taking this class with basically zero background knowledge, you will quickly realize that by the end of this course you will not have learned much aside from the names of a few mathematical concepts and models. Sajda is a pleasant professor and certainly knows his material well, but the shortcomings with this course come not from him but from the Biomedical Engineering Department not adequately preparing undergrads with the knowledge required for a class like this one. As a result, this course becomes a game of trial-and-error, praying and dead reckoning. I don't think any of the undergrads I took this class will finish with any real idea of what is going on.\nGood luck and Godspeed to any future BME Imaging majors. \n\nWorkload:\nHomework 40% (additional bonus assignment can replace lowest homework)\nMidterm 30% (no final)\nFinal project 30%\nI do not believe there is a separate curve between undergrads and grad students.\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class sucks. Do not take. Sajda is a nice guy but he can't teach for his life. He expects you to have lots of prior knowledge about signals and signal processing, which undergrad BME's do not have. He breezes through complex mathematical concepts and expects students to apply these concepts in difficult and unclear homework assignments. There really is no point in going to class because he posts his powerpoints online and pretty much reads off of them. The midterm is not bad; the average is a 80, but he doesn't tell you whats going to be on it.\nWorkload:\nImpossible weekly problem sets which he doesn't tell you anything about and expects to do. Expect to spend 10+ hours per week unless you go to office hours. Okay midterm. No final, just a final project.\n"
