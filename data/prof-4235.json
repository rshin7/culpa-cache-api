Unfortunately, he's leaving Columbia forever, so this is the last review anyone will write of him.\nHis class consisted of great, enlightening mini-lectures followed by discussion. He guided us towards interesting questions and helped us get the most out of the readings, including when we clearly hadn't read - he would take us very gently through the main ideas. The only exception to this was after his wife had a child, at which point he clearly started putting less time into his notes.\nMade an effort to challenge our views, but never to be an ass about it.\nWorkload:\n5 mini-essays (1000 words each, best 4 count), an easy midterm of short essay answers, and one mini-essay to write during the final.\n"
