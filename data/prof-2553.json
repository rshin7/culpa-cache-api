Is willing to go the extra mile, dig deeper and truly allow for discussion in the class.  First class in which I genuinely felt that a real Discussion occurred on a regular basis, and not one between student/instructor but rather student/student/student/instructor.  DEFINITELY take THIS class from THIS instructor.  Do not miss this instructor...she's terrific. \nWorkload:\nFair/do-able volume of interesting readings you will look forward to, weekly written responses, totally approachable exam. Come on, its an intro class. \n"
