            "review_content": "\nViola is a wonderful teacher of beginning German because she is a.) a native speaker, b.) extremely patient even when people cannot communicate at all and c.)really enthusiastic about the German language and helping her students learn. The workload isn't super heavy, because it's pretty slowgoing at first. German is noooot easy, especially the pronunciation. But all 17 people in my class went on to elementary ii, which I think says something about how good Viola is.\nWorkload:\ntest every other week (very specific review sheet given the day before), 5 short essays, midterm, final\n"
