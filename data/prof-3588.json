            "review_content": "\nKatya is literally the worst TA I've ever had. She is not a linguistics person, so I'm not sure what she was doing in Linguistics save for the Russian factor, because she had no idea what she was doing. She'd come in late every class (which was really obvious because she wore clunky boots that made more noise than I'd ever thought possible) and she could not answer even the simplest of questions. Her \"sections\" after class were funny just because every question sent her directly to the book where, obviously, everyone had already been, and she didn't understand the material. She also forgot the homework at home several times. She was just so timid and always seemed like she was on the verge of tears. I feel like this girl is too fragile to be a TA -- we all were torn between feeling really bad for her and also just annoyed that she was so incompetent. Hopefully, she will never TA a linguistics class again. I don't think that she or the class could handle it.\nWorkload:\nOh, Katya had nothing to do with work. She just kind of sat around and looked frightened.\n"
