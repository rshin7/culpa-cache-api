Sometimes she gave answers out to problem sets.  Too bad the class sucked, as a whole. Her problem set grading is harsh, especially compared to other sections, but in the end, you'll do fine in the class. Just ask questions, though -- otherwise you won't learn a thing.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem set (graded harsh) that were sometimes group projects/presentations, weekly discussion question (easy), Frontiers final\n"
