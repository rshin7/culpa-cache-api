Our previous exam had a 60% mean and the other midterm had a 73% mean. This means that something like half of our glass is near failing... I literally don't know how he's going to get away with failing this many students buttttt WHAT THE FUCK.\nHe isn't that helpful but the class would be totally fine if he made it fair by curving the class.\nWorkload:\nLight but it doesn't matter\n"

            "review_content": "\nI have never left a review on CULPA, but I feel I need to warn people of \"Professor\" Caridi. HE IS THE WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD, INCLUDING HIGH SCHOOL. He cannot teach at all. Unfortunately, I am a student who goes to his lectures. He goes through pointless PowerPoints the entire class and often incorrectly solves examples. He finally fixes the problem when a grad student points out his error. For the midterms he loves to say \"If you have been coming to class, then you should be fine, if not, then good luck.\" WRONG. The exams look nothing like the examples or HW we do. The averages on the midterms are horrible and HE DOES NOT CURVE. All other stat teachers curve, from what I have heard. Pretty ironic that the worst teacher at Columbia does not. It amazes me how a teacher like this can be hired at such a prestigious university. All in all, AVOID FRANK CARIDI AT ALL COSTS.   \nWorkload:\nNot bad. About a problem set a week (ungraded just marked for completion). But the problem sets are close to pointless when preparing for the exams and only account for 5% of your grade. 2 midterms and 1 final.\nHW - 5%\nMidterm 1 - 20%\nMidterm 2 - 25%\nFinal - 50%\n"

            "review_content": "\nI had Professor Caridi for Introduction to Statistics with Calculus this past semester. I will try to be as objective as I can writing his review, but just know that bottom line: don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take his class ever.\nHis classes are 1) very boring and uninspirational 2) useless. You are not required to come to class, but he does take attendance for the record\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6which is kinda pointless. He stutters a lot and takes a lot of time to talk about one very simple idea/method/technique or he just talks about one concept for the longest time.\nCaridi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favorite quote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been showing up to class, then you should do absolutely fine on the test.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u2020\u0090 WHAT? As a person who actually (sadly), went to most of his lectures, I can tell you that is not true because he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t teach you anything. You just have to study off of the book and the practice problems, which also suck. The textbook that is used is really confusing because it doesn't explain much. It gives you a formula and basically you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re by yourself and NO CARIDI DOES NOT EXPLAIN HOW TO DO THE PROBLEMS.\nAlso, for homework. The first 10 or so homeworks (out of 12) were agonizingly (and uselessly) with a required average of about 10-16 (?) problems per homework. AND THEN I think he realized he was being very inefficient and gave us about 3, 4 questions for the last two homeworks each\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how this guy has been teaching at Columbia and he really just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to teach statistics. Yes, he does know statistics, but he cannot teach.\nOh and the tests averages are horrible, but he doesn't curve them. He wouldn't tell us the statistics to the second midterm because he knew the average was crap and he should curve the grades, but again, very stubborn and just the worst enemy for a student.\nAll in all, he is terrible. At one point he really made me angry at the fact that Columbia could have a terrible \u00e2\u20ac\u0153professor\u00e2\u20ac\u009d like him. If you can avoid his class, then do so.\nWorkload:\nHW: Weekly PSet\n2 Midterms (I've heard many other stats classes only had one...)\n1 Final (that was just like whatttttt????)\n"

            "review_content": "\nI had Caridi for Stats w/ Calc. The class is horrible. The book is the worst textbook I have ever used (no exaggeration); their is zero conceptual underpinning. You memorize formulas from the book, write them down for the test, and plug in numbers without ever knowing what you're really doing. Caridi doesn't help at all; most people don't show up to class because he can't explain things and when the students don't understand he gets mad and yells at them. (He writes before every test, \"If you've been showing up to class, you should do fine. If not, then good luck.\" His perceptions of his teaching effectiveness  are wildly inflated.)\nThis class is the culmination of my disappointment with Columbia. We supposedly come here for the great education this school offers, but anything I've learned in this class I've learned through Youtube tutorials. I would advise against taking this class, but (in typical Columbia fashion), you're probably taking it as a requirement.\nGetting an A isn't too hard; it's finding an ounce of inspiration is near-impossible. I'm sure I'll look back on this class when I graduate and realize I wasted my college years.\nWorkload:\nNot bad. Weekly homework exercises, two midterms, and a final. If you do the practice problems he recommends, you should be fine.\n"

He sent out this so-called classroom etiquette announcement as followed. He should think about how he can improve the lecture, as it is his own faults that students don't stay until the end of the class. \nSubject: Classroom Etiquette\nStudents,\nFor those of you who did not hear what I said at end of class here it goes again.\nI cut you folks a lot of slack regarding attendance.  It's not required.  I don't make a fuss about people leaving before end of class as long as it is done discretely.  Therefore, I expect the same consideration from all of you.\nPassing in front of the class in the middle of my lecture is distracting and disruptive to me and the rest of the class. In future if you plan to leave early for a good reason please give me a heads up at the start of class and sit on the door side of the room.\nIf you anticipate boredom, frustration, anxiety or simply are someone who can not be patient till the end of class, have the good sense to sit on the door side.  If you are not on the door side, then just tough it out till the end of class.  Remember that you are always free to express your feelings about the lecture to me in private and in a more constructive way.  Please observe this simple courtesy so we do not have any future misunderstanding.\nOf course, if you are suddenly sick or urgently need a bio-break or some other unexpected emergency arises that requires you to leave, then by all means take the shortest route to the door wherever you are sitting.   \nThanks for your consideration.\nFC\nWorkload:\nOne fairly easy HW assignment per week. Ungraded, counted as 100 marks as long as you summit it. \nmid-term/final \n"

            "review_content": "\nSpeaking from an English major's point of view (and not one who, by an interesting character-twist, loves math), this was the wrong course to take. I was hoping that I would end up like stats and find it interesting, but it was both boring and difficult. How is that possible? Well, taught myself. Badly. I spent hours on something I was definitely not capable of understanding alone. Yes, I actually did go to every single agonizingly boring 9 a.m. class, unlike half the students enrolled, but Mr. Caridi's power-points are about as helpful as spending a whole class JUST reading Hamlet without discussing it. Not to compare statistics to Hamlet (sorry Shakey.)  Not that I intend to take too many more math classes, but I've heard that, while Columbia has many great departments, statistics is not one of them. \nIf, like some people (and believe me, the average for this class was extremely low and NOT CURVED) you are a stats-smart person and think you can handle it, take the class. But don't expect to be thrilled by Caridi's teaching style. Looking back, I should have taken astronomy or something more challenging, but also more interesting.\nMy Advice:\n1. Start early, learn the powerpoints before class\n2. See the TA\n3. DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS\n4. Don't take this class. :l For serious, not worth it unless you have a particular interest in statistics.\nWorkload:\nPractice problems, midterm, final\n"

At such an elite institution it is understandable that brilliant faculty is more synonymous with excellent researchers than excellent instructors.

His method of \"death by powerpoint\" should in no way be considered an acceptable alternative to effective communication of course materials. \nThough his powerpoint slides are incredibly through, his inability to engage the class, provide an effective method for learning the material, and lack of curiosity as to why his class size was so small except on exam days, goes to show his lack of touch with pedagogical methods. \nIf it wasn't for his TA's, this class would be a nightmare not because the material is difficult, but because you sit and waste an hour an change of your life when it would be better spent in the TA's office hours.\n\nWorkload:\nModerate: One problem set a week, relatively easy but sometimes long!\nMidterm x2: Piece of cake, as long as you keep up with assignments\nFinal: Ditto\n"
