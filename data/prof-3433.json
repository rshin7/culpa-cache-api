On the first day of class, I was overwhelmed by her fast-paced French.  It took me a few weeks to get used to it, but otherwise, the course was manageable. \nWorkload:\nfive easy tests (one every other week) 20%, 1 midterm 10%, Participation 20%, 5 Compositions 20%, Oral Presentation (you recite then discuss a poem/song/etc for 10-15 min) 10%, final 20%\n"
