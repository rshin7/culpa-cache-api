            "review_content": "\nJamie is a great teacher - very clear, concise, fun, young, energetic, and smart.  He is a PhD candidate at Columbia and writes about art/books/fashion for some magazines.  He made U. Writing a fun class to come to.  \nOur class discussed Twilight and the role of vampires in society once and there were many other similar discussions/days that were just fun.\nIt is a really good idea to meet with Jamie because it is the only way to really know what write, how to edit, etc.  He does a great job of teaching in class and of getting everyone to share, but if you want feedback on your specific essay, set up a meeting.\nOverall, I'd say a really good choice for any freshman.\nWorkload:\n4 papers (as must be the case with U. Writing) - though the last one he made much shorter and could be written in a letter format, opposed to an academic essay.\n"
