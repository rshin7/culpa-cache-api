            "review_content": "\nGerman is a monstrously difficult language to learn, but Ramona made it fun and fascinating. She spoke entirely in German; rather than break down and give us the English for a difficult word, she would become a shameless physical comedienne, playing charades until we understood her. She's a grad student from Germany, so she understands the intricacies of the language and the culture, and passes these on in every class. She genuinely enjoys what she does and was a pleasure to learn from.\nWorkload:\nThe workload is standard to the German department: exercises and grammar lessons due every class period that usually take about 40 minutes, a short composition due about once a week, periodic quizzes and tests. There's also much class discussion and a fair amount of in-class reading. The course goes quite quickly and German is difficult, so be on your toes.\n"
