            "review_content": "\nIf it wasn't for Kori, I never would have survived Solid Earth.  She can't help that the labs are really complicated and often take hours and hours of time to complete, but since she's got more patience than I thought was possible she'll answer every single one of your questions until you understand what you're supposed to do.  What's so great is that she doesn't just feed you answers, but instead helps you along by providing helpful hints so ultimately you come up with the answer.  Sometimes this seems annoying, but since you came up with the idea yourself you tend to remember it easier.   Many a time Kori helped me figure out what I was supposed to do, and always encouraged me even when I felt like I was banging my head against a brick wall.  She deserves TA of the Year Award or something for her infinite patience and sense of humor that keeps you laughing when you've been working for many hours and the lab no longer makes sense.\nWorkload:\nRegular Solid Earth labs, 1 per week\n"
