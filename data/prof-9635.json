As long as you turn the work in on time, follow the guidelines for essays, and take in feedback notes from previous work,  you will get an A. Most people who did not get an A had their grades lowered because of tardiness, poor attendance or turning papers in late. As long as you show up and participate, you're all set. She's not strict when grading papers. The texts in this class are not particularly interesting reads and Diana can be very mellow which results in this class being quite uneventful (aka boring). With that said, she is very sweet, attentive and organized. \nWorkload:\nYou have texts to read after every class and questions to answer about them, free writes in class, four essays (critical response, conversational, research, op-ed) \n"
