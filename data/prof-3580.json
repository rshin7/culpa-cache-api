He doesn't challenge the students to try and solve a problem in class.  The man is simply not someone you want to be taught by with this course.  THIS COURSE IS HEAVY MATH. Do not take this if you don't already know enough math to get through.  His exams and quizzes are disturbing in scale 20 point final, for example.  If you get 1 wrong you're SOL and so on...\nWorkload:\nHomework every week, takes days and weeks to get them back, three exams\n"
