He is very approachable and actually enjoys meeting with students. Believe it or not, but he has children -- unlike most profs at Columbia -- so he is more understanding than most other profs. His lectures are upbeat and enjoyable. He can be tough grading wise, but the extra work is well worth it. You will know your shit after this class. Whether you take Waltz's class in National Security Policy or in a different subject, it will be well worth it.\nWorkload:\nGood amount of reading.. but not excessive... midterm and 15 page paper \n"
