            "review_content": "\nProfessor Viswanathan is a professor who always encourages her favorite students to always actively engage her material, and to never focus on cycles of revenge, trauma, or shame & hypocrisy that would low-brow analyze her subjects. Therefore, professor Viswananthan is a great professor and side-steps desperate themes of anti-Americanism that plagues and thus renders a share of the nation's community colleges professors as not ready to hold an office at a prestigious university like Columbia University, as she does. \nWorkload:\nHer workload consists of three main papers, 2 during the semester of equal magnitude, and 1 at the end of a relatively greater magnitude. She reads your papers to a degree of detail that she can recall points from them and integrate them into the seminar at the right times.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. V is extremely knowledgeable about really cool, esoteric things.  In addition, she is skilled at creating an intimate seminar environment in which everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas, but student comments never get out of hand.  She is very helpful in terms of meeting outside of class and clearly sees the success of her students to be a priority.  She is a fair grader, meaning that she will call you on your BS, but reward you justly when you've done good work.  Her paper comments are thoughtful and thorough.  And, to top it all off, she took us all out for dinner at the end!!!!! \nWorkload:\n2 short papers (4-5), 1 longer paper (7-10), 1 presentation\n"

She has an excellent way of showing her support for students' diverse readings of the texts. When she decides to lecture it is most always relevant, clear, and always the spring board for another dimension of discussion rather than an end in itself. \nWorkload:\nVery managable. Two 5-page papers. 1 12-page final on a project of your choice. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI am an English Major in CC and only take seminars because I prefer the class discussions and hands on experience that lectures don't provide.  So far, I have taken 5 seminars with some of Columbia's top professors.  \nGauri Viswanathan is the reason I studied my butt off in highschool to get into Columbia.  \nHer lectures and comments on the books inspire class discussion.  She doesnt force her students to speak, we all fight eachother to be called on next.  That to me, is the sign of a wonderful professor.  In so many classes I have taken, professors are  articulate but don't encourage discussion, that is what makes seminars boring because you can't escape.  Professor Viswanathan is the opposite.  She is open to different interpretations and she encourages all sorts of comments and takes on the material.  Often times we would stray from the topics to prove a particular point.  I don't know why anyone would call her cold and aloof.  Intimidating yes, cold, absolutely not.  You have to understand something about Professor Viswanathan.  She is a very smart women, not just well read and well spoken, she is a top scholar in her field.  She links themes and topics and presents them in a way that is mind boggling  If you were that smart don't you think you would feel slightly out of place dealing with a room full of 18 20-year old hormone raging college students?  I honestly think we intimidate her.  If you ever speak to her one on one you will realize that if you are open and friendly and carefree with her, she becomes more at ease.  She is a nice person and wants to be nice (and is nice) but I think she may be a little socially uncomfortable at times.  \nk, about the literature.  Awesome books, really interesting, she chooses great classics.  While you can get away with doing only some of the reading, this was the only class this year that I did all of it because it wasn't like pulling teeth.  2 five  page papers and a final 10 page paper.  Super easy, only meets once a week and in essence the cherry on my cupcake this semester.\n \nWorkload:\n2 5 page paper and a final 10 page paper (you can elaborate on one of the 5 page paper).  Fair grader\n"
