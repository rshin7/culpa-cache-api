            "review_content": "\nGreat guy who obviously cares a lot about the material. But he definitely tends to care a little too much at times. You can totally skate by in the class by not doing anything other than the 2 short papers and taking the midterm (operas included), but if you actually look at the syllabus and all that he has planned for each day and night of the course, you may start to feel bad about not doing at least some of it. Also sometimes it seems like he makes up answers to questions students ask him, but that could just be me being over judgmental. Overall, great Music Hum section, a lot of expected of you, but none of it is actually required.\nWorkload:\nBasically no homework, 2 small papers, and a final.\n"
