            "review_content": "\nAn excellent, easy survey class.  I would highly recommend it as an easy, interesting A for anyone looking to fulfill their history requirement.  The only stipulation is do not take it with Ivano del Prete; he is an adjunct professor who is pretty much impossible to understand due to his thick Italian accent.  If you take it with Valenze, you're in good hands; just show up to class and write everything she says (as in don't do the reading except the books for discussion section); then study it the night before and you'll get an A.  You have to do the book reading for discussion section though.  If you have the misfortune of taking it with Ivano, just do the readings and you should be fine.\nWorkload:\nReading you don't have to do if you go to class, reading for the sporadic discussion sections that you have to do to write the response papers, in class midterm, in class final, and an essay.\n"

If you ever took a European History class on the HS level, you will fly through this course. I'd say this was an easy version of AP Euro. It is pretty entertaining how serious some people took this class considering all the knowledge is so basic. Class is very optional, assuming you have a computer to help you fill in the study guide for the midterm. There were 5, 1 page reviews of readings--which are easy, 1 midterm with a comprehensive study guide so you knew exactly what was on the Essay midterm. And then an in-class essay final that she gave to the whole class before hand. So if you want to get a B+ and put in minimal work, this is a great class.\nWorkload:\n5x1 page responses, easy midterm, in-class final that you know before hand\n"

            "review_content": "\nFor a survey class that had to cover hundreds of years of history in one semester, this course did a pretty good job.  If you already know a lot about European history, get ready for some repetition\u00e2\u20ac\u201da lot of the information is very basic, as you would expect from a survey course\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut there are plenty of interesting anecdotes to keep you entertained.  I'd especially recommend this course for anyone looking for an enjoyable, relatively easy way to fulfill the premodern or Euro requirements of the history major\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthis class definitely will not stress you out.  Professor Valenze is very approachable and enthusiastic about the subject matter, and she goes above and beyond to spice up her lectures and keep the workload manageable.  \nWorkload:\nEasy.  Originally we were supposed to have two papers (4-5 pages each, I believe), but she canceled the second paper after we wrote the first one, which was a 5-page book review.  We had a midterm (IDs and essay, and she gave out an ID study guide) and a take-home final.  There was a lot of reading, but I definitely did not do all of it.  Just be sure to read the supplementary articles\u00e2\u20ac\u201din my opinion, the textbook is pretty unnecessary if you're attending lecture.  \n"

Professor Valenze is a really nice lady who genuinely cares about the history of food and globalization of food etc.  However, some of the topics are a bit over kill.  Nevertheless, it is an easy way to fulfill a history seminar and a rather painless class.  Meets once a week and you get snacks in every class.  Make sure to speak up and she will really appreciate it.\nWorkload:\nweekly response papers, one 5 page paper, one 10+ page paper.  skim readings to be able to add a few comments and write response papers (ungraded).  paper topics are pretty open. not too bad\n"

            "review_content": "\nShe's so nice, definitely in her own world sometimes, but then you remember she's an accomplished & published historian, and it's all okay! She would go off topic, so we would miss some material that I would've liked to have covered. She sometimes calls on people to answer questions...but it's a huge lecture, so it's really weird. Her workload isn't bad, she's maybe the nicest woman alive, and she's incredibly smart (although she does have her moments...) You won't be riveted to your chair by her lectures, but it's definitely a good intro course and serves its purpose. However, the TA's do all the grading which is super frustrating because she doesn't really look at the papers or tests, and I personally like it when the accomplished historian atleast has some say in my grade...Overall, I recommend this class for sure, just don't go in looking to be spellbound by the glory of a famous woman historian..it ain't gonna happen.\nWorkload:\nEasy. Weekly readings (not bad at all), Midterm (terms & essays given out beforehand), 1 paper 10-12 pages (you pick the topic), Final (terms & essays given out beforehand), bi-weekly discussion sections with some annoying ta's\n"

She gives helpful handouts before the midterm and final, if you study those you're homefree.  I attended lecture for about half the semester, but when I realized how little indepth we were going into the material, I stopped going & just read the textbook and managed an A- in the class.  The additional readings are a complete waste of time, but discussion section were interesting.  Ryan Jones was an awesome (and HOT) TA, so if he's still there sign up for him...  I recommend the class.  It fills the history requirement, and I learned a lot about European History...\nWorkload:\nabout a chapter of reading in the textbook everyweek, additional books for discussion section, 1 paper, a midterm and a final (with helpful review sheets)\n"

Prof Valenze is just a cute little woman who is easygoing with the class and the workload.  One really has no need to attend the lectures, and the book readings need only skimming.  However, as one who rarely attended lecture, the textbook is a godsend.  Use it to fill out the review sheets that Prof hands out in order to prepare for midterm and final.  This can be an easy class, and a good starter into a history major.\nWorkload:\nAbout a chapter a week out of the text books, four or five books that really don't need to be read.  There are discussion sections that, if you don't do the book readings, will help you get the gist of what's going on.  Common books are read to, such as Utopia and the Prince.\n"

The reading is simple, and Valenze's lectures are usually unimportant and sometimes on very silly topics like eating habits. If you want  an easy start to your history major, or just an easy class [especially if you have some knowledge of the subject], I highly recommend this class. The subject matter is interesting [to me], and the class was easy - win-win. FYI - her cutesy  jokes make the Barnard girls go wild...\nWorkload:\nsome textbook reading [ I dont think we covered more than 7 chapters], and some extra, mostly useless reading [but make sure to read the worms/cheese book and the sci. rev. book.]  One paper [the topic will be easy, but put some time into since it's like 30% of your grade]. Midterm and Final were easier than AP History test. Get a good TA [Phil, if he is still there] and studying will be a breeze. \n"

Relatively easy survey of lots of important European history. The class can be dry and unorganized at times, leaving one's attention wandering. All in all, not terrible, and certainly not Prof. Valenze's fault. She seems quite knowledgable, but the format of the course does not really allow her to expand on many events. History majors taking the course may find themselves somewhat bored. \nWorkload:\nLight. 1 short (4 page) paper early in the semester, midterm, and final. Relatively mild amounts of reading. \n"
