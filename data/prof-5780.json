For the first two weeks on our own, she would watch us, but after that, she sat in her office. It was up to the students if they wanted to play, or just sit around. In my section, it was about half and half. If you really want to learn the sport, she'll give you the basics, but beyond that you'll have to learn from other students or watch videos online. We were let out after only half an hour twice.\nWorkload:\nStandard PE attendance: up to 6 absences to pass. Minimal physical exertion.\n"
