            "review_content": "\nThis class was terrible. The teacher is OK with everything that you suggest, but then will be a tough grader based on nothing. She is obsessed with attendance, and does not talk about modern sculpture at all except from a few poor examples and an artist talk that was not at all organized, and not a good or known artist. The critiques are pretentious and the assignments are very arbitrary - she does not introduce you to any history of sculpture, nor are the assignments based on anything art-historical or relevant. Basically, she lets the student play to be an artist and grades are based on her random taste and her perception of the effort that you put on the class, which is inaccurate. I put a lot of effort into the class, which takes up +6h/ week, and got a B+. People who spent much less time and effort, and whose sculpture was very abstract and non-relevant, got better grades because of her obscure concept of what a good sculpture is, which she does not care to explain at all throughout the semester. Overall, it completely lacks the necessary theoretical part that a visual arts nowadays should have, and completely fails to teach the student anything about modern sculpture, while making it hard for him or her to get a good grade or to develop a style. I give it a 0 out of10 and I hope that she will not teach another class at Columbia, because she lacks both ability to teach and knowledge about modern and classical sculpture. Really, a failure. \nWorkload:\nThree projects because she was too disorganized to make her own syllabus work with the time provided for the class. \n"
