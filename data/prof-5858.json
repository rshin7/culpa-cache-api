Really knew his stuff, but was approachable and not arogant about it - broke down the readings, but also gave us a chance to talk about them. Usually you get a sense of what the TA knows/doesnt know and what he/she want you to say for the \"right\" answer, but Seva made discussion feel like I was actually learning a lot without being lectured at.\nAllso, funny anecdotes about life in Russia. The simulation exercise was surprisingly useful. Actually, this was probably the only section I went to consistently. \nOne complaint - no TA should have a discussion just 1.5 hours after lecture, that's just wasted time!\nWorkload:\nmoderate reading load, but it was covered pretty clearly in lectures and discussion; grading can be arbitrary between TAs\n"
