            "review_content": "\nI think this class has the potential to be much better than it was this semester\u00e2\u20ac\u201dJorge Aguilar, our accompanist/coach, was out sick for about two months, so we kept shuffling pianists, which made learning repertoire more difficult than it should have been. It's really too bad that he was out because he's ridiculously talented and the two coachings I did have with him were unbelievably helpful. \nThe bulk of the repertoire you learn in this class is classical song literature, so if that bores you to tears, don't take this class. \nJane is a sweetheart, but she's off her rocker. 99% of her critiques are very sweet but occasionally she'll give you a correction that'll be weirdly harsh and esoteric. I don't know how much my vocal technique improved, but she did give me a couple of helpful corrections over the semester.\nWorkload:\n1 concert report, 1 comparative song versions paper, 1 fantasy recital program, 1 final concert. The rest depends on how seriously you take the class. If you really want to learn new rep, you can have a coaching and learn a new piece almost every week. If not, that's your prerogative. You do have to sing in front of Jane and your classmates, which can be nervewracking, but you get used to it.\n"

            "review_content": "\nMY FAVORITE CLASS EVER! If I could take this class every semester with Jane and my classmates from last semester I would. Jane is an absolute sweetheart (WAY laid back-very cool), although she definitely spews out a few unintentional insults throughout the semester. They're so rude though that it's funny. She is open to hear any and everything you have to say or suggest, and loves to hear from the class. I really looked forward to going to this class every week; everyone was so talented and we all shared a passion for singing. \nWorkload:\nWriteups due basically whenever you get them done. Not a tough grader at all; I think she appreciates and grades more on effort than ability. (aka if you have a great voice and a bad attitude expect to get what you give)\n"

Take this class if you want an introduction to different styles of songs, including French, German and Spanish. You will get to work on them individually with the accompanist and there are performance workshops for those who like to show off their talents. All in all, a great class for a developing singer. Jane and the other students give feedback when you sing, and most of it is quite true. The atmosphere was very laid-back. \nWorkload:\n4 written assignments, two quizzes, and a final concert.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class is definately one of the easiest As you will get a Columbia...just be aware that you will only get out of it what you put in.  Jane is extremely forgetful most of the time, which usually works to the student's advantage.  Youl will sometimes wonder if she is clinically insane, and her comments are often harsh and unhelpful.  You wont have to do much work, but showing up to this class will seem burdensome enough.  This lady has an amazing potential to suck the joy out of singing.\nWorkload:\nNot too much.  All you have to do is some journal entries that she usually forgets she assigns until much later.  You have to learn and present song, but if you've had lessons before you can just pull from stuff you already know.  The final is a perforomance which you'll hope no one you know attends.\n"

            "review_content": "\nDefinitely one of the easiest classes you can take for three credits. You do have to be very self-motivated to actually learn anything from the class. Most of the time, the class was incredibly boring and unproductive. I would definitely question Jane's actual skill in teaching or in knowing technique at all because she certainly doesn't help singers in this respect or seem to know anything about it in general (although she does make you do useless back bends for breathing which look ridiculous). She is also incredibly flaky most of the time and forgets important points such as the dates for papers (good for the student though). If you're looking for an easy A, the class is fine...just don't expect anything riveting. The class is very laid back. Also expect randomly harsh criticisms from her. As a person she is generally nice and seems to be high most of the time. Personally I would rather have taken voice lessons (as long as she wasn't my instructor)\nWorkload:\nThree papers, an ungraded pass/fail test, and a \"midterm\" (it was easy as hell and pass/fail)\n"

            "review_content": "\nYou have to be very self-motivated if you want to walk away from this class having learned something. When you are assigned a new genre of song, you can either go to Gabe Wiener [Dodge] and find a new selection or just sing something you've done a thousand times with your private teacher. The international phonetic alphabet stuff is useful, but you don't spend enough time on it in class. You have to buy three books but there isn't exactly any assigned reading, so I don't think I ever did any. Needless to say, the atmosphere in there is pretty low-key. Jane has the best of intentions, but sometimes her comments are insulting. Don't take it personally. Just figure it's the price you pay for one of the easiest A's at Columbia. Oh, and our accompanist was really hot, so that's a bonus!\nWorkload:\nShow up at the voice audition to be admitted to the class [she takes about 12 kids.] Three papers and a final recital. Not even an issue.\n"

Learn to sing some songs ... NOT a big deal for anybody who has had voice lessons. Three light papers that are graded generously ... some of the material is pretty interesting. A final recital with guests ... you'll either want to crawl under the table or smile prettily for Mom & Dad.\n"
