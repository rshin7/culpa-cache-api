            "review_content": "\nFantastic professor. Her seminar -- Race, Poverty, and American Criminal Justice -- is one of the best classes I've taken here. The class shows what American Studies as a department does right: she's a full-time criminal defense lawyer who teaches what she does everyday. It's hardly a law class, though, much more big-think-y although you get a good solid background in the fundamentals of the American criminal justice system, with a focus on the racial/class elements. She doesn't hide her political beliefs, which are quite liberal, but she plays devil's advocate and encourages different points of views. She's really serious, engaging, and fun. \nI came in as a second semester senior really sick of taking classes about ideology and ready to talk to someone in the real world about the issues I'd spent so much time studying, and this class provided that exactly.\nWorkload:\nVery reasonable: pretty light, interesting weekly readings, one 15-pager due at the end of the semester. You have to be ready to talk in class. \n"
