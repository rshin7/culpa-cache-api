            "review_content": "\nIf you're willing to drop a hundred-some dollars (the course fee) on it, this is about as good as PE gets. Five or six classes (only four of which you have to show up for) of three hours each, plus a weekend-long river trip that is included in the course fee. You're done by the first week of November. The classes are spent half in the pool practicing, half watching videos that have enough surfer dudes and extreme sports types in them to keep you more than amused. Doug is awesome, kayaking is really enjoyable once you get used to being strapped into a boat with your head underwater, and a weekend on the Delaware is a hell of a lot more fun than a semester in the gym\n"
