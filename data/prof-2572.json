I didn't realize this until my friend who had other TAs in the class didn't get any outlines for the books because their TAs didn't make any. I did a paper incorrectly for this class and Nancy allowed me to redo it, and she worked closely with me, meeting outside of class to make sure I did it right. She is very knowledgable of the material for this class, and asks good questions. She is also helpful and reachable through email. She is definitely one of the best TAs I've ever had at  Barnard and Columbia. \nWorkload:\ngreat class. Rosalind Rosenberg was the prof. Wonderful woman. A lot of reading, but interesting. one 1 pged. document analysis, one 5 paged paper, one 10paged paper, TA sessions every other week in place of class. \n"
