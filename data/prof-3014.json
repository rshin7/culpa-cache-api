Avoid TA Dessi.\nPro tip: show up to every class and take notes. Getting notes from a friend might suffice, but you'll probably get confused because the concepts get somewhat complex as he goes on, plus they build on each other.\nComo is funny and a fantastic lecturer. I came away from his lectures with a solid (very general and pretty novice, but nonetheless kinda legit) understanding of the basics of Indian, Chinese and Japanese Buddhism.\nAvoid TA Dessi. Seriously. Her bark is worse than her bite (grading), but she's just a pain to deal with during the semester. I've heard some other TA's are good: Jay, Su-Jung, maybe another.\nWorkload:\n-readings (you don't really need to do them, just browse the ones that they say will be important for the midterm & final)\n-midterm (20% i think)\n-3 small quizzes (3% each)\n-final exam (30% i think)\n-final paper (40% i think)\n"

As someone who never really got a chance to study Asian history or religion, this class was a great survey class on Buddhism's rise in India, China, and Japan. \nHe really tried to remember people's names in the beginning of the year and was almost always open to answer questions that arose. \nThe midterm and final were both fairly easy. They consisted of a number of vocab from a list that was given to us beforehand and 1-2 essays. The grading can be pretty harsh though- I lost close to 20 points on the midterm for a few, very minor mistakes. \nMy TA mentioned that they were going to grade the final partially on how much it referred to/engaged with the texts we read so I'd recommend you actually do the reading. \nProf. Como and the TAs asked for feedback around the middle of the semester which led to more discussion meetings to go over the readings and lectures. I appreciated how quickly the TAs accommodated the demand for more meetings.  \nIn all, this was a really interesting class and I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't studied Buddhism before. \nWorkload:\nWeekly Readings, about 20-30 pages per class\n3 Vocab Quizzes\n1 Midterm\n1 Final\n8-10 Paper\n"

He is hilarious, and very good at presenting the material covered in class, which is much more than you realize you're covering because he's just that good! I took the class to fulfill the global core requirement, as most probably do, but I also have a genuine interest in the subject matter, which helped. For those with an open mind, this class should be a piece of cake. The grading is not harsh at all, and the midterm was INCREDIBLY easy so long as you've been following along with lectures. Go to the lectures, otherwise you might get lost. In the event that do, try to borrow notes from someone, but he also provides a really helpful review of last lecture at the start of every class. The readings aren't all necessary though, I didn't do them all. \nMy TA was also the best TA I've had at Columbia, but it's Su Jung's last semester here I believe, so sorry guys! Still, you should take this class. I really think you should.\nWorkload:\n3 vocab quizzes, 1 midterm, 1 final, 1 6-8 page paper. Substantial amount of readings, but not necessarily crucial that you do them all, just try not to miss lectures.\n"

In a semester where I only had great professors, he was by far the best \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a large part of the reason I became a religion major. When class was over each day, I was consistently disappointed that I didn't get to stay longer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the material is fascinating, and Professor Como does an excellent job making it relevant and accessible without dumbing it down. He is hilarious, very organized, and absolutely brilliant and while he has high expectations, he gives you everything you need not only to do well in the class but to retain the information in the long term. I remember more from this class than almost any I've taken. I would encourage absolutely everyone to enroll \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0it will be pretty much the best decision of your college career.\nAlso to the reviewer below me, if we didn't have to go to class what function would our professors even have? If you were hoping to spend more time on other subjects, ok, but you can't possibly fault the professor for making his job about actually teaching. Reading is supposed to complement the class, not replace it, and Buddhism is notoriously difficult to understand, which is why you take a class rather than just reading a book.\nWorkload:\nLots of reading, but reasonable, and everything is reviewed in depth in class, so if you have to skim it's not the end of the world.\n"

Next, because the reading is so ridiculous, you MUST go to lecture if you want to pass (another great discouragement for SEAS kids). Oh yeah, the lectures also happen to be unbearable.

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Como is competent, charming and gregarious.  His mastery of Buddhism in India, China and Japan is astounding.  The course contextualizes Buddhism in India, China and Japan (Korea was left out).  The course evidences that Buddhism is malleable. It is a seed planted in different cultural soils, and manifests differently creating many flavors of Buddhism.  It is a rather sociological approach, and it works. Additionally, students are exposed to Buddhist dogma, tenets and the sutras, or the religious part of Buddhism. \nComo is an expert speaker, clear and concise.  He also expediently and skillfully uses humor to rationalize some of the more complex ideologies. For example, the concept of  interconnectivity was presented via a student's bagel.  It took many people, in fact everyone, to make that bagel paralleling the concept that we are all linked to each other, and ultimately Buddha. \nComo does not take individual interest in his students, except in a superficial way.  He will more than likely not learn your name, or chat with students outside of class.  In situations like this, it is incumbent upon you to make a concerted effort to present yourself.  Visit his office hours, he is exceptionally nice and appreciates your company.  You can also catch him at coffee houses around campus. He is always amiable\nComo defers to T.A.'s for grading, so there is little use in complaining about a grade to the Professor.  T.A.'s rarely if ever change contested marks. However, if they see you improve, your final grade will be fine.  Do get to know your T.A.   Some of them may not know the subject matter and are learning like you.  This provides a great opportunity for you to figure things out with your T.A..  \nYou do not have to be an East Asian Studies major to take and enjoy  any of Como's classes. His class is accessible to all, which mirrors Buddhist mantra of reaching all sentient beings.  Moreover, if you resonate with any of the philosophies, chances are you were a Buddhist in a past life (if you believe in that).  I personally resonated with the concept that we need to detach from illusions that cause mental anguish. Let's just say I de-friended some people on facebook. \nComo's class is hands down the best course offered to fill a humanities requirement.  It's not easy.  Lots of readings, which are really useless, numerous quizzes, two major papers and a final, but it is rewarding and fun.  If you take it, you may even become enlightened.    \nWorkload:\nNumerous quizzes, tons of readings.  You quickly realize readings don't correspond with class lectures, and therefore you don't really need to do them in depth.  However, you must MUST attend each and every lecture or else you will lost. Take good notes and form a study group (a bunch of us did, and we all did great compared to those who did not).  There are two papers, one midway through, the other at the end.  The papers are weighted heavily so do your research. The East Asian Library is a very good resource. There is also a midterm and final, both of which were not that bad. Write clearly and stick to the bullet points and you'll do great. \n"

He managed to keep me, a checked-out, second semester senior, in class and entertained with his dynamic lectures and fun stories. He really knows his stuff, and he wants to make sure you do, too. He gives an outline at the beginning of every class, he makes sure to answer questions before moving from topic to topic, and he makes sure that you understand how all the different facts and stories relate to one another.\nIf you're looking for a global core class to take, you can't go wrong with Buddhism with Como.\n\nWorkload:\nReadings for each class, maybe 80-100 pages a week. You don't need to do them to do well in the class, though. 3 quizzes (10%), 6-8 page final paper (40%), midterm (20%), final (30%).

Professor Como is an unbelievably engaging and clear lecturer who genuinely wants to ensure that the entire class understands the material. That also leads to the only minor downside, namely that he fields a lot of dumb questions from the whole class. But I digress. Como is the man. There are no two ways about it. The lectures are carefully outlined on the board and he intersperses his points with general humor and hilarious stories about his family. Story time with Como simply cannot be beat and takes the class from enjoyable to a must-take. He is easily one of the top three professors I have had and the workload was not difficult at all, making this a great choice for Global Core. \nWorkload:\n3 reading quizzes which don't even require doing the reading, midterm, 8-10 page research paper, final.

The two leaders for the next week's class met with Professor Como at Starbucks on the Friday before class to discuss the readings and come up with questions about them, then these questions were emailed out to the class.  Everyone was to post responses on CourseWorks by 5 PM on Sunday.  \nThe class focused more on spirits than on bodies, though you can't really separate the two here.  We also spent most of our time reading about China, though we did go into Vietnam and Korea a little, and Japan for a few weeks at the end.  \nThis class was my first exposure to East Asian religions, and I made it through, though I do suggest taking other classes in East Asian religion for the extra background information.

As someone with a background in East Asian studies, I wanted to learn far more about the content of the course--about religion.  Instead, we spent more than half of the lectures going over basics of Japanese history, defining terms, doing rough synopses of what happened in Japan over the ages.  Except that these explanations were less thorough than that you'd have received in Japanese Civ, and yet they took time away from thorough explanations of religion.  It's more like we learned the historical bases of religion, such as what kind of movements there were, how they were viewed by society, how they interacted with the government...  But we didn't actually spend enough time learning about their theology, about WHAT the religions where about--just when and where they happened.  It was a good and interesting enough class, but it still felt like an overview, and it left me wondering what I have to do if I want to take a class that stops being a brief overview of all of the history of the country and actually gets into the meat and substance of the matter.\nWorkload:\nNot bad at all.
