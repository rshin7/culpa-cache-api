My section was reluctant to speak up in class, unfortunately, but once everyone did, it made the process that much less painful. UWriting on its own is dry and unappealing, so the amount of energy Leah put into it formed the entirety of my interest in this course.\nLeah is always enthusiastic about everyone\u2019s new work, in addition to being very understanding and open. She expects everyone to adhere to her standards which she sets out at the start of the semester, but she\u2019s very understanding when it comes to student-related stress. Just talk to her if you have any questions.\nTry and participate to make the most out of it. She really cares, guys.\nWorkload:\nA looooot of assigned reading for every class, almost weekly short writing exercises. Regular UWriting progression workload (Exploratory Drafts, Workshop Drafts, Final Drafts)\n"
