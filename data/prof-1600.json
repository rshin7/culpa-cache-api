The task is deceptively simple (learn to paint as you see), yet Sissel shows us that there's always something new to learn.  She also has high expectations, which can be met with hard effort: we seriously copied Rembrandts within a month!  Thoroughly introducing us to the art world, Sissel brought us to museums, galleries, and artists' studios.  I can't think of a finer beginning experience with oil painting.\nWorkload:\nA painting in class, a painting for weekly homework.  The final, which is a triptych, is daunting yet able to be done.  You'll work hard, but you'll be amazed with the results.\n"
