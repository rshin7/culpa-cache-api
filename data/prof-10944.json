He was happy to answer any questions and very patient. The classroom environment was relaxed but we still got through the material. If you listen and class and study before the tests you will most likely succeed! \nWorkload:\nhomework every night that takes around 10 minutes, 6 tests but he drops the lowest grade. \n"

            "review_content": "\nVery good teacher who caters to his students needs. If you don't understand something he will wait until you do and continue to explain it. Overall not a hard course. Tests are pretty easy and he tells you exactly what is on them.\nWorkload:\nDaily homework usually takes 10-15 minutes not bad at all! Frequent quizzes on little material and a final at the end of the course.\n"
