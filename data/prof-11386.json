He almost made me switch my minor from psychology to anthropology because he was such a great lecturer.\nAlthough his class wasn't the easiest to take notes in just because sometimes he would diverge from a topic. It was great because he always used real life examples which made the material so much clearer. \nI also went to his office hours and had a whole hour conversation with him about life. He shared a lot of insight and really made me understand the world better. \nPlus he is witty and hilarious. I would say he is one of my favorite professors so far in college. \nWorkload:\n3 or 4 short essays. The topics are all really interesting. \none midterm\none final- the review session was really really helpful\n"
