            "review_content": "\nGonzalez taught the first half of Gen Chem II, Bursten the second half.\nGonzalez:  Sucks as a lecturer.\nBursten:  Good lecturer.\nClass: Pretty much every exam (3 midterms, 1 final) had 50% or lower averages.  The TA's couldn't even get full scores.  It was beyond ridiculous; the test questions are much much harder than anything covered by anyone whether the professors or the TAs or the assigned problems.  Most people straight up guessed on 1/4-1/2 of each test. Clicker questions which are stupid and a waste of time/money b/c only the top 3 students in a letter grade get bumped up if they answer correctly 50% of the clicker questions.  \nBoth profs refused to release the answers for practice exams/actual exams.  They created special exam review sessions where it was crowded with people trying to copy down every question/answer and \nAvoid these professors if you can.  Everyone dumps on Beer, but at least his tests/grading is fair.  \nWorkload:\nAssigned problem uncollected/graded.  Quizzes in recitation session.  3 midterms, 1 exam. One midterm/quizzes grade dropped.\n"
