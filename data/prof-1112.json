            "review_content": "\nZhang is a very difficult professor to write an accurate review for. His class could accurately be described as hell, but I don't really think it was his fault. He is both very smart and very funny. My issue was with the textbook - the thing was horrible; it didn't explain anything well, and the homework problems were abstruse. To be fair, Zhang also hated the textbook, and said he would change it up for next semester. Given that, I think this class will be a lot more reasonable in following semesters. Still, be wary. Zhang is kind of a wild card when it comes to out of class accessibility; sometimes he's nice, sometimes he makes fun of you. If you have trouble with proofs or are short on time, I'd probably advise against this class.\n\nWorkload:\nI admit I kind of lol'ed at the previous reviewer's statement that all the homework problems could be easily \"checked by hand using a simple computer program or applet online\". What!? Maybe that will make sense to CS people, but certainly not to me. The homework was extremely difficult, and took hours upon hours to do. The tests, however, are more reasonable because Zhang gives in-depth outlines beforehand, so you'll know what's coming.\n"

He admitted to not having looked much through the textbook, having gotten it via a colleague's recommendation, and as a result was taken aback when it turned out to be far denser than he thought.  The course's pacing was off; most of the time we went too slowly.  I would feel rather dishonest to say that I know even elementary number theory after this course\nI'm willing to chalk a bit up to the fact that he's a busy mathematician with other commitments and did not take much time to set up this course.  I suspect were he to teach again, he'd pick a different textbook that was more user friendly, as well as spending more time designing the curriculum.\nWorkload:\nRather easy - Weekly homework assignments that could almost all be checked by hand using a simple computer program or applet online, 2 midterms whose difficulty was on par with homeworks, and the choice of an actual final (weighted accordingly) or a third midterm (we chose the latter).\n"

I thought it was going to be one of those classes you have nightmares about, you know, the ones where you can't understand ANYTHING the professor is saying and the material is SUPER difficult to grasp.\nWell, anyways, once you get past his accent, he's actually a pretty good teacher. He often let's you out of class early, holds regular office hours and will not show you the answer but guide you through a problem if you had one.\nTo be honest, I failed the first midterm. The second midterm I got a C-. I would have failed the class except...\nhe gave me this ultimatum basically. I never went to class or did homework, but if I turned in all of my homework for the rest of the semester and went to class and got an 85 or above on the final, he would make my overall grade for the class the same as my final exam grade. Needless to say I scraped by BARELY with an 87% and received a B+. How's that for procrastination!\nWorkload:\nNot too bad from what I can remember, but I never did it.

All of which are pretty straight forward.  A lot of professors say that \"if you can do the problem sets, you will be fine\" but Zhang really means it.  They are *exactly* like the problem sets but with different numbers.  You pretty much just needed to memorize formulas and you'd do fine.

I liked how Zhang emphasized fundamentals. It really tied together the different conepts and theorem's well. I think this class was really good.

Calculus IV might thus seem ridiculous to this man and boring, and as the other reviews said, you are better off studying it on your own. But I think that is the rule for math classes in general. You simply can't expect to learn calc 4 if all you do is have somebody lecture you the material twice a week, especially if you are not intelligent enough to understand people with accents: Columbia has the best scholars from the globe.  That said, his teaching is better for moral advice than for getting a clue about the material. He does do mistakes on the board, but if you are clever enough, you can learn a lot more from mistakes than from perfectly prepared lectures. He won't spoon-feed you during class, but do go to his office hours, and he will be very friendly and help you. All in all, a great guy.\nWorkload:\nWorkload: Weekly problem set from the book, 2 midterms, final.

You go to class to laugh, not to learn. The book teaches way better than Zhang can. The only reason why people like him is because he gives easy exams (but you don't learn). By the way, I got an A in the class, so I'm not writing this because he screwed me over..I'm writing this because his class is pointless and is just a waste of time.

            "review_content": "\nProf. Zhang (who\u00c2\u2019s name apparently would mean dirty in Chinese if said \u00c2\u201cZang\u00c2\u201d according to him) is the worst Calc teacher I have encountered at columbia. The first impression you will get of Zang is that his English is horrible. I have encountered asian professors before (Prof. Cao and Prof. Kim) and in comparison they are both scholars of the English language. In the beginning you will, if you\u00c2\u2019re lucky, understand about 30% of what this man is saying and by the end of the semester you will probably understand 70%, which is still quite sad. However Zang\u00c2\u2019s strange pronunciation results in amusing terms like \u00c2\u201cRussian numbers\u00c2\u201d (rational numbers) but can be very confusing at the same time like \u00c2\u201cthe Corin Theorem\u00c2\u201d (Green\u00c2\u2019s theorem). The language problem notwithstanding, Zang does not come off as a very good mathematician, continuously giving up in the middle of problems and being surprised when problems come out to be zero. He also finds that his students should take mathematics simply on belief as he always says \u00c2\u201cdo you believe\u00c2\u201d at the end of horrible explanations. A great example of Zang\u00c2\u2019s math skills were demonstrated when he was solving the second midterm on the board after handing it back (of course he didn\u00c2\u2019t have answers or an answer key nor did he correct the exam, the TA did), the professor only barely got 3 out of 5 problems completely correct even though he wrote the exam! And the exam was not hard. Bottom line is I WENT TO EVERY SINGLE CALC 4 CLASS, NEVER MISSED ONE, UNLIKE THESE OTHER REVIEWS FROM PEOPLE WHO CLEARLY WENT TO AT BEST A FEW CLASSES, and after experiencing a full semester of Zang I can honestly say that he is a pretty bad teacher. Granted he is the most amusing teacher I\u00c2\u2019ve encountered at Columbia due to his many blunders and his ridiculous smile, but that doesn\u00c2\u2019t make him a good teacher. If you are considering Zang as a teacher this is all you need to know: HE IS A PRETTY BAD TEACHER, TEACHING SIMPLE MATERIAL, AND GIVING VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD EXAMS\u00c2\u2026READ THE BOOK AND GO TO CLASS TO SEE ZHANG\u00c2\u2019S UNINTENTIONAL STANDUP COMEDY ROUTINE. Oh and if anyone was wondering, no I am not bitter because I did badly in the class, I did well, I just don\u00c2\u2019t think making a class simple makes the teacher good.\nWorkload:\nProblem set every week (10 problems from the book), 2 midterms and a final. All very straight forward.\n"

He won't notice if you don't go to class but you have to go to get the homework problems in the textbook which he assigns at the end of class.  You can either call somebody or just show up for the last few minutes if you really don't wanna go.  Also, he often ends class as early as half an hour before the end of class.  He pretty much teaches with examples and finishes when he's done covering the material.  If you don't understand something, read the textbook.  I actually suggest reading the section that will be covered before class.  He is very open to questions.  One more thing, don't let him catch you leaving class in the middle.
