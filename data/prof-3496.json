It's hard to get a good grade because the classes and homeworks are 90% useless. You really have to be a trooper to pick out that 10%.\nIt's a fundamentally bad idea to have three experts split up an intro level class. They sometimes overlap, sometimes lack cohesiveness,  and just generally don't have enough time in front of a class to get their stuff together.\nWorkload:\nweekly homework, weekly labs, two midterms and a final. lots of time, not a lot of thought. At least your brain doesn't get tired.\n"
