            "review_content": "\nJutta is the love of my life. As a foreign language learner, who has had his fair share of foreign language teachers, she is by far the best I have ever had. She is not only incredibly knowledgeable about German, but is amazing at teaching you it. She does not correct every mistake you make in order to foster a desire to speak, while making sure you are remembering key grammar points. She has convinced me to seek a concentration in German. She prepares you very well for all of the tests and is a generous grader. The regular and constant structure of the course is not only very German, but very nice because you always know what happens. \nWorkload:\nTest every week\nQuiz every week (extremely easy)\nEssay every week (you rewrite them to get a higher grade)\nTextbook exercises every night \n"

            "review_content": "\nFirstly the accelerated Beginners German I & II was amazing.  In five weeks Jutta was able to present all of the information in an intelligible and structured manner that facilitated an excellent learning environment.  Her class was laborious and enjoyable.  Because of the abbreviated time frame the work load was strenuous to say the least.  We had roughly 2/1 homework to class time ratio, however the in class experience made the nightly work far easier and manageable.  I highly suggest Jutta as a professor, as she is open, fun and more than willing to go the extra mile to assist in and out of class.  Wonderful professor and educator!\nWorkload:\nGiven accelerated 5 week course, the workload was intimidating but achievable.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThe atmosphere Jutta provided was ideal for learning languages; relaxed and comfortable rather than stressful and awkward. The class is fast paced, covers a LOT of information, and has a significant amount of work. You need to be both self motivated, and willing to devote time to this class in order to do well. \nThe class started out with about 20 or so people, but we were left with about 8 after shopping ended. Because of the small class size, and seeing each other 4 days of the week, we developed an interesting family dynamic with Jutta as our captain. Class was always fun, interesting, and worth it. Time was broken up well, and class rarely seemed to drag (good when you're in the room for over 2 hours). \nBe ready to not only sit in your chairs class-room style, but stand up, interact with students, do extensive talking, show your creativity, and learn how to use German in your day-to-day activities. Although we did learn what was in the book, Jutta didn't limit herself to it, which expanded knowledge about German culture.  We followed a film series in the class, which is a real laugh, and a fun way to improve listening skills. At the end of the year, we review by watching a German film (no subtitles!)\nIn short: the class is very fun, and Jutta is an excellent teacher.\nWorkload:\nNightly homework that while easy, takes a long time to complete (~1.5-2 hours, nightly plus extra study time to learn grammar). Mostly bookwork, which you are expected to self check and then turn in (answers at back of book, but you need to write out the exercises, and not just give answers). Bi-weekly compositions that start at around 50 words, and progress to about 150-200 at the end of the semester. (one week you write, the next week you do a second draft-the grades are then averaged together). Weekly quizes that died down towards the last quarter (no re-takes, grade of 0 if not present/late to class and miss); very straightforward, and often times quite easy. Tests were aprox. weekly, and covered one chapter at a time. While more difficult than quizes, still straightforward and not difficult to do well on. No midterm, and a final. \n"

            "review_content": "\nEven if you have a moderate interest in German, I highly recommend taking this course. Jutta made me so passionate about learning German and this course was really the highlight of my semester. From day one Jutta speaks exclusively in German. She exposed us not only to the German language, but brought in German music and cultural activities. The class meets for two hours, four days a week, which can be a lot. Jutta broke up the time well, bringing us to the Language Resource Center, and bringing diverse activities to class.\nJutta is an extremely practical professor. She understands if you have too much work for other classes and need to hand in an assignment at a later date. She is not very flexible about exams or quizzes though, which is fair. Jutta clearly outlines the requirements for the course, and she definitely does not overload you with work, but you still learn Deutsch. You get out of this class what you put into it, and Jutta NEVER hold you back from learning as much as you can.  \nNot only is Jutta an extremely gifted professor, but she is a fantastic person. She has a unique and wonderful sense of humor. I don't think there was one day this semester that I didn't laugh at her jokes. I cannot wait to take another course with Jutta.\nWorkload:\nAt the beginning of the semester we had nightly homework that rarely took more than and hour or so. Also, at the beginning of the semester we had weekly chapter tests, although those died out in the second half of the semester. Weekly quizzes that are very easy to do well on. Also bi-weekly compositions (Aufsatz!). No midterm and a final, which was very fair. Oral final exam as well but nothing to worry about. \n"

            "review_content": "\nJutta is phenomenal - both as a person and as a professor. She has a wonderful sense of humor, is genuinely kind and understanding, and is an outstanding professor. I learned so much from her class, and she has made me fall in love with German. She creates so many interactive and fun activities to help you learn, and she brings her crazy humor to the written assignments in the best possible way. Going to class wasn't just enjoyable, it was always the highlight of the academic part of my day.\nAn 8 credit class can seem a bit daunting to handle, yet she makes it very doable. She isn't intimidating at all and works with you to make sure you get all of the work done. The homework load is very light, especially for a course worth this many credits. However, you will really only get out of this class what you put into it. You can get away with doing very little work and you'll probably still do pretty well. If you really want to learn German, though, it makes sense that you should work with the grammar and vocab every day. \nI highly recommend taking this class. Even if you go into it with just a moderate interest in German, you'll come out of it with a deep appreciation for the language and a desire to learn more. This class was one of the best things about my first semester at Columbia. I truly can't speak highly enough of Jutta or of this class.\nWorkload:\nNightly grammar exercises. Very light. The most in one night was 2 hours (only once). Usually only about half an hour. Sometimes only 10 minutes.\nTests once a week at the beginning of the semester (none at the end). Quizzes once a week; written so that you can pretty easily get a 100. (Tests were on Mondays, quizzes on Thursdays). Essays (100-200 words) once every 2 weeks or so.\nFinal and Oral Final\n"

            "review_content": "\nTwo semesters in one. It is a lot, but it is also wonderful. The intensity of the accelerated course (8 points) really lets you get to know your classmates. Jutta is very good at getting students to interact. She is full of energy, though sometimes I think that her having a little child makes her treat us kind of like children learning a language. This isn't so bad. We got to use crayons (colors = Farben) one and we did a treasure hunt (directions: recht, links, gerade). Her methodology varies, and you can tell that she is making an effort to accomodate the various learning methods of her students. \nWarning for people who aren't usually on time:\nALWAYS be on time. I know the punctual(p\u00c3\u00bcnktlich!)-German a stereotype, but it holds true for Jutta. Late homework is not accepted. Go to every class. If you do not consistently follow these guidelines, your grade will be marked down. There is some 5 minute rule, where every 5 minutes has a consequence, but I forget what. \nAnyhow, you will adjust if you're into the class. \nIt is a lot of fun and it will make you love German. \nWorkload:\nExpect two hours of homework a night, not very hard, and even enjoyable if you like learning languages. Computer lab assignments (in class, sometimes to take home and finish). Workbook exercises. Exercises in a notebook to be turned in to her to make sure you did it (the answers are in the back of the book, she tells you, and you should check them yourselves). \nIt is a lot, but if you're taking an 8-point language course, what else would you expect?\n"

            "review_content": "\nLet me start off with the largest downside to her class: although the material and basis is provided for you to learn a lot, if you're not self-motivated, you probably won't learn as much as you'd learn in a more demanding and stressful environment.\nThat said, it is precisely Jutta's approach that makes her so worthwhile. I could come into class having the worst of days, and with a scowl tattooed on my face. And goddamn it, her humor might be more 3 Stooges than Dennis Miller, but she almost invariably lightens the mood of the class and accomplishes the primarily critical task of making class enjoyable.\nSome people in the class complained she didn't teach enough grammar and there wasn't enough formal teaching. That is true, but I believe there is a larger intent to structure the class based around working a lot with other students and practicing your German instead of being lectured about it.\nShe isn't loosey-goosey about deadlines and punctuality. She will take off points if you willy-nilly choose to be late or not hand in assignments. But if you approach her beforehand, she's very understanding and knows that there is more going on in your life than German class. She borders the line between sufficiently authoritative instructor and compassionate, light-hearted human being quite well. She's quite accessible both in person and electronically.\n\nWorkload:\nHomework after each class; ranging from easy bookwork to more time and energy-consuming essays. She is a fair, if not generous grader.\n"

From the first day onwards, Jutta speaks only German in the classroom but manages to make students who do not know the language understand everything she says.  She is understanding, amiable, and overall HILARIOUS!  Should a student need anything from her (extension, excused absence, etc.), just approach Jutta, and she will be more than happy to oblige.  She makes students want to attend the class.  Whilst there is nightly homework, it is never too much, nor are the tests and quizzes exceptionally difficult---namely because Jutta excels in teaching everything that needs to be learnt for the chapter.  Highly, highly, highly recommened.  She is phenomenal; few language professors can compare.  Most of all: her sense of humour is bloody brilliant; go to class just for the jokes.\nWorkload:\nNightly homework; chapter tests and quizzes; mini-essays; final exam (written and oral)\n"

            "review_content": "\nI don't think Jutta necessarily merits a silver nugget. She can be oddly funny at times and, yes, she's an easy grader, but these qualities do not an excellent class make. All too often she was indulgent of idiotic sideshows performed by hooligan freshmen, as well as stupid and inane comments often emerging from the same pathetic peanut gallery. Other long and torturous periods of the class consisted of her staring oddly at individual students in a haunting and frankly disconcerting way. Far too much of this class was spent on goofiness rather than actual learning, and while that might work for some who enjoy throwing away their tuition money, for those who wanted to actually improve their German (and mine as well as several others' actually backslided over the course of the semester), this amounted to a mediocre class at best, and a serious waste of time at worst. Recommended only for those who would prefer to be in kindergarten rather than college.\nWorkload:\nA few short papers, vocab lists, personalized vocab quizzes (which I actually credit Jutta for putting a lot of effort into), little homework exercises, and the standard German department end of the year portfolio involving lots of little elements which take up far more time than one expects.\n"

It truly was an excellent class, and Jutta was a very fun, amazing teacher. I definitely recommend it.\nWorkload:\nVery light. Bring in an article relating to our topic of conversation for every class, participate, few short grammar exercises and paragraph essays. Only pain in the ass assignment was the journal that had to be updated 5 days a week, but, if you kept up with it, I suppose it wasn't painful at all.\n"
