            "review_content": "\n\nMax Schmeder made Ear Training an extremely enjoyable class. I had never taken a music class before and Max made me feel really comfortable. He is really funny and really interested in his students, often going on wild tangents about something a student brings up. His classes usually involve him asking students to sing or tap some of the homework exercises and then doing dictations or interval training. His tests are tough but fair and he gives you a lot of time to prepare. He could do a better job teaching intervals because he puts them on the tests but makes you learn them from this interactive website,\n\n\nWorkload:\ndaily singing and rythm exerices. He says he gives pop quizzes but he only gave one and it was announced. Midterm and final composed of intervals, chordal progressions, sight and prepared singing, and tapping exercises.\n\n"
