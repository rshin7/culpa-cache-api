Good to take if you care about where it all started, bad if you want to know about modern Fem (after 1960's), doesn't even touch on that. Kimmich is one of those teachers that seems to be looking for a specific response out of her students, she adores the students/robots that spit out Fem. rhetoric they've read in other classes and fails to value any independent thinkers. Her grading is unpredictable, A's for papers on topics she favors, B-'s for not setting up the paper the way she would have. Well you didn't write the paper, sh*t I did! She offers extra time on top of office hours but is cold and hard to talk too. \nWorkload:\nYou have to go to an C.R.O.W event (@ Barnard) and write a paper on how it relates to the readings. You have to write another paper on a contemporary women's issue and relate it to the course. Everyone in the class has to give a presentation on one book and write a paper on it. Every week you have a book to read and some are awfully hard to get through! \n"
