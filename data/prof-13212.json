The texts are preset by the department but he was able to lead meaningful discussions. He communicated with the class weekly (if not more) to add readings and meaningful material. He enjoys teaching and it shows! Definitely recommend!\nWorkload:\nHeavy reading (as are all CC sections). midterm, final, several short papers, 2 longer papers. Fair and impartial.\n"
