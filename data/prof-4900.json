            "review_content": "\nBrook was a great teacher. He was laid back, enthusiastic, and made every effort to make the sometimes dry Intermediate II curriculum interesting.\nHe assigned more work than any other German instructor I've had (a lot of it was busy work, though) and was the toughest grader I've had in a German class (though he was fair). He also gave us a couple of quizzes, which was surprising given that I had none in Intermediate German I.\nOverall, I'd recommend him as an instructor. \nWorkload:\nHeavier than other German classes, but really not bad at all.\n"
