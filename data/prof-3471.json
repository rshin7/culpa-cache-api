She had some very interesting advice, was open to everyone's questions, and completely available outside of class.  She brought us a great guest speaker, too.  I would highly recommend her for Beginning Creative Writing--she was fun, personable, bright, helpful, and taught a lot.\nWorkload:\nweekly crits, and, because of large class size, only 2 submissions.\n"
