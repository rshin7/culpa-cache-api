            "review_content": "\nProfessor McIntyre is an intelligent, patient and dedicated professor who teaches Logic with enthusiasm. When we moved on from Sentential Logic to Predicate Logic, she tells us:  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You should all be very exited about this, now you can write real sentences.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d She takes the time to tell you why a concept is important from a philosophical point of view and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t focus on Logic from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mathematical\u00e2\u20ac\u009d perspective \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something I valued as a math-phobic student. She treats everyone with respect, is willing to answer any question, and makes herself available to every student. She even offers extended office hours before exams.  If you \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d all you have to do is ask \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll explain things until you do understand.  She really cares about her students. \nI would recommend taking this class during the Fall/Spring semesters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or perhaps during a longer summer session. I found it difficult to keep up with the pace of the six-week summer session. \n\nWorkload:\nKeeping in mind this was a six-week summer session, the course load required working on problem sets each night, quizzes every week (one is dropped) and two exams. She is an extremely fair grader and sometimes offers extra points on quizzes and exams.\n"
