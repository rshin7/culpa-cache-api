This class really depends on class discussions and while there were some duds, the majority of our section was communicative and coherent. Naid really makes an effort to make sure you understood the discussion and did a vocab review at the end of each class, where she went over words/phrases we got wrong or used incorrectly. I'd say take this class, as it really helps in improving your oral french and keeps you in good stead for further study of the language.\nWorkload:\n1 presentation and 1 revue de presse. 1 vocab/grammar quiz. \n"
