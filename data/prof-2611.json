The midterm and final consist of portfolio reviews - laid back, quick discussions.  The class atmosphere is chill.  We listened to music while working on our projects.  Derrick is easy to talk to, and he mainly wants you to be as creative as possible.  If its obvious that you have not spent hours and hours on a given project, he doesn't care, as long as its creative.  \nWorkload:\nLIGHT!\n"
