I have never experienced another professor that comes close to how dedicated and enthused Jason is about his class and his subject. \nI would recommend ANYTHING this man teaches because you will learn so much and enjoy every class. He expects a lot out of you but has every right to do so because he puts so much into each and every one of his classes and assignments.\nTruly an enjoyable person and teacher. TAKE HIS CLASSES.\n\nWorkload:\nA lot. This is not a class you want to take if you aren't looking to actually learn and be challenged. If you want to learn a lot and develop your ability to think critically and analyze scientific literature, this is the class for you!\n"

            "review_content": "\nJason is a great professor. He is really smart and pretty clearly a badass in the world of Psychology, but is not pompous or conceited about it. He structures the class well; discussion was always stimulating, even if we didn't always get to all the papers we had read for that week. He also provides much opportunity for his students to grow and develop their skills in analysis and writing.\nHe is not an easy professor and expects a lot from his students. This course required weekly blog posts of 750-1250 words, complete wiht summaries and analysis of a specified question. It seemed like a lot at the beginning of the semester and took a decent amount of organization, but after a short bit I settled into the amount of writing each week and it felt like a piece of cake. Also, being a blog and putting in pictures and making it public made it more fun than just a teacher response paper. But don't go into the class expecting it to be a cake-walk seminar-- it's challenging, and Jason expects you to really delve into the topics thoroughly, do all the reading, and put a lot of effort into the posts and your research proposal. \nWorkload:\nWeekly 750-1250 word blog posts, research proposal: initial proposal, oral proposal (a lot of emphasis on this), and final proposal. Peer review and good support for all, but it is a decent amount of work. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI took the Wandering Mind senior seminar with Jason, and I'd highly recommend him. He's very accessible, organized, and great at facilitating class discussion. The class was challenging, but he is really great about providing weekly feedback on your progress so to me that was really motivating in doing my coursework. \nWe got an email every week with a score on our class participation and our blog posts about that week's article. He really cares about his students and takes the time to make sure they feel appreciated. Take a class with him!\nWorkload:\n2-4 fairly intense journal articles a week, and you have to write a blog post synthesizing them. Class participation is graded. Final paper is a unique research proposal and you have to present your proposal to the class.\nDefinitely fairly intense in the coursework, so don't take this course unless you are interested in the material and have the time.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Buhle clearly cares about his students. He is always available to meet and discuss anything, for a lengthy amount of time. This course was very discussion-based - we were assigned ~4 articles to read, and a discussion leader would lead the conversation. The articles were very interesting and really helped form a cohesive understanding of the wandering mind, although there could have been more direction regarding how the discussion leaders each class should have conducted the discussions, which were not always well organized and depended too much on the student leader. After each class, Prof. Buhle emailed a grade for class participation and our blog posts, with comments; at first this was slightly nerve-wracking, but I later appreciated it because Prof. Buhle would clarify what he expected from us and how we could improve, and it was helpful to get so much individual attention.\nHe is passionate about the topic and knowledgeable - it's his area of focus in research - and we learned a lot about the wandering mind, while developing other \"seminar skills\" like analyzing a journal article and organizing a good oral presentation.\nWorkload:\nnote: this was a summer course\n- 4 articles to read before each class\n- attend a meditation course somewhere in the city\n- class participation 25%\n- blog posts (500-1000 words) responding to the articles 25%\n- discussion leader, to guide/teach one class 5%\n- research proposal on a novel idea for a study 30% (= 15% for 15 minute oral proposal & 15% for 6 page written proposal)\n- peer reviews on everyone else's oral proposals 15%\n"

            "review_content": "\nPSYCH SQ3225: Wandering Mind\nThis seminar is a fascinating scientific inquiry into the wandering mind that seizes undivided attentions. Readings range from developmental psychology, cognitive studies, to neuroscience providing a much appreciated assortment of perspectives on the topic. More than knowledge is gained; as the academic rigor of this course is balanced only by the value Professor Buhle places on cultivating every student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to read and reason through diverse research studies with sound, cogent analysis. The intellectual tide rises to such a supportively high level that each student floats to scholar status by the course end. I highly recommend this seminar. \n\nWorkload:\nGiven the quick pacing of the summer session, the workload can be intense at the end; but much is gained for the sake of enduring knowledge. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI just took Jason's seminar in the psychology of attention during a summer session.  In general, I found Jason to be an earnest, honest, intense, intelligent, and creative teacher.  The readings and pedagogical methods were on target, and I dare say that I'm walking away with a decent grasp of major issues in the psychology of attention, at least as it is currently formulated.  Jason took a genuine interest in seeing ALL of us learn and succeed, and I will jump at the opportunity to take another class with him if that is feasible.        \nWorkload:\nThe workload was pretty grinding, but this was a 5-1/2 week summer session course, so that was to be expected.  Needless to say, don't wait to the last minute--as I sometimes did--and you should be okay.  There are no curve balls in Jason's classes, and he's fair.\n"

            "review_content": "\nPROFESSOR PROS--Jason Buhle is a young, smart, (cute! but married lol, so don't get too excited) professor who is straightforward with what the class requires.  \n     1) As this is a seminar, participation is a large part of the grade, so after each class he'll email you with a participation score and his reasons for that session, which I personally loved.  While this might seem initially stressful, ultimately it keeps you on your toes and makes you work harder so it's actually good for your grade (MUCH better than when professors just give you a subjective participation grade from what they happen to remember at the end of the semester.)  \n     2) Super approachable.  You know those profs who are difficult or intimidating to have a one-on-one convo with them?  Not this guy, will help you with concerns and tell you how you can do better.\n     3) Lays out exactly what he expects.  EX: for the power point presentation requirement, he spent a good 20-30 minutes of class time giving tips for power point and public speaking dos/donts.\nPROFESSOR CONS--Can be a little dry.  Not monotone-voice boring though.\nMATERIAL PROS--It's about why the mind wanders--a fundamentally interesting and universal topic.  Don't need to purchase any books, all assigned articles are on courseworks.\nMATERIAL CONS--Readings can be kind of dense because you're really gonna go into neuroscientific and psychological frameworks (with detailed experiments and methodology) about why attention falters.  This ain't Intro to Psych folks.\nWorkload:\n1) 3-4 heavy articles per session\n2) participation--discuss in class (you pick one session to lead discussion.) \n3) power point presentation\n4) 6 page final paper\n5) peer reviews of classmate's presentations\n"

            "review_content": "\nI wholly disagree with the review below: Prof Buhle presents all of the material coherently, encourages responses from the class and fields questions thoughtfully, and is generally personable and enthusiastic. Some of the material may be redundant for Neuroscience/Psychology majors (particularly those who have already taken Science of Psychology), but this is no indictment of Prof Buhle's teaching ability.\nIn any case, if the lectures bore you, you need not wake up for them; attendence is not taken (unlike in some Science of Psychology courses) and there are no assignments that must be turned in. \nOn the other hand, if you are struggling with the class, there is plenty of opportunity for extra credit (in the form of weekly online quizzes and experiment participation) and you can engage in the ungraded \"self-check\" review quizzes that are presented at the beginning of lectures. \nIndeed, with his attention to student understanding of the material (at the macro as well as micro level) Prof Buhle makes a 100-200 student lecture seem much smaller.\nWorkload:\nIdeal for an introductory lecture course: absolutely no \"busy work\" (everything except the 3 exams is optional) yet the potential for 6+ points of extra credit. \n"

The guest lecturers are wonderful (Jen, Heather, etc.), but other than that, a sleepy way to start my mornings (and at 9AM no less). I guess the class is required for the neuroscience major, and the tests aren't incredibly difficult (he gives A+'s, which is nice), so it could be worse I suppose.\nWorkload:\nWeekly self-tests, 3 exams, 1 final\n"
