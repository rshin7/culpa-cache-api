The purpose of the TA is to answer questions, but Andrew Pinkard continually deflects this duty towards \"our classmates.\" Andrew Pinkard should encourage us to ask questions rather than reprimanding us for asking him questions.\nAnother passage from Andrew's email \"A note about quizzes\" sent on April 2, 2014.\n\"I've been getting many emails from students asking \"what's the quiz going to be on?\" While I understand your curiosity about this, please know that you already know the answer: the quiz will be on any material covered since the last quiz, up through Monday's lecture of the quiz week. This has always been the case for the last 5 quizzes and will continue to be the case for the rest of the semester.  There is no need to ask me via email about this because this has not changed and will not change for the duration of our recitations.\nThe quiz will cover where you left off from the last exam (free energy), up until Monday's lecture about free energy and it's connection to equilibrium. The quiz will have content from Chapter 10 and your Chapter 10 homework assignment.\"\nI'll close read this passage. \"While I understand your curiosity\" is a demeaning statement used to tell students that Andrew Pinkard does not like receiving emails from them. \"please know that you already know the answer\" is a false statement made by Andrew Pinkard in order to camouflage his own ineptitude in following the syllabus that he created to describe what material we would be quizzed on.\nIf this isn't passive aggressive, then I don't know what is. This is unacceptable that Andrew Pinkard reprimands the class for posing questions that he refuses to answer. Every week he changes what was on the quiz, for our thursday recitation, there was often significant material from the wednesday class even though Andrew Pinkard clearly stated that this material would not be included on recitation quizzes. Since Andrew refuses to clarify the material that we would be quizzed on, he cannot fault the class for asking questions.\n2) Andrew Pinkard spent an entire recitation explaining the unknown parable of oxidation states to the class. I KNOW ALL ABOUT OXIDATION STATES! He refuses to actually go over difficult material, instead choosing to teach us how to determine oxidation states, one of the few things in this course that I actually learned about in high school.\nWorkload:\nWeekly quizzes based on homeworks and lecture\n"
