            "review_content": "\nMatthew was undeniably the best teacher I've ever had.  Going to Lit Hum every Monday and Wednesday night was a treat.  This man is funny, understanding, and has incredible passion for the material.  The class is almost completely student-run, as Matthew prepares very few lectures (the maps he draws on the board are wonderful, though).  Instead, he points us to key passages and then asks us broad questions to consider.  He almost never shoots down any ideas (unless they're factually wrong), and always encourages his students to think of new ways to deal with and appreciate the texts.  He doesn't hold regular office hours, but he's super willing to meet with you about essays (which you DEFINITELY want to do).  If you can, by all means switch into his class.  \nWorkload:\nFirst semester--4 essays (graded harshly, but they don't seem to affect the final grade much...), midterm (IDs, essay; IDs can be rough but he grades the essay very generously), department final (again, he grades the essay and passage explication very generously).  Second semester--2 essays, midterm, department final.  Read the books, participate actively in class, and you should have your A.\n"
