She also includes a lot of cultural, historical breadth during class, so it makes lessons much more interactive and interesting. She is one of the few instructors who really, and happily, encourage you to participate. Most instructors want you to, but cringe when you make mistakes. She's not like that. She's young, energetic, flexible, and is extremely personable. Highly recommended! \nWorkload:\nAlmost bi-weekly exams, light reading, occasional worksheets, midterm, final.\n"
