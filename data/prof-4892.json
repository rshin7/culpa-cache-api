            "review_content": "\nAlex is THE MAN.  He is fun and interesting as a person, and that really carries over into his teaching style.  This is one of the few professors who has ever made me *want* to get up for a nine am class!  He's a native speaker, so you don't have to worry about picking up a funky accent.  He tries to make the activities as interesting as possible.  There's lots of group-work and conversation, with a heavy emphasis on interaction in general.  He's very knowledgeable about the language in general and is always willing to stop, answer questions, conjugate verbs, repeat pronunciations multiple times...take his class if at all possible.  He is everything you could ever want in a foreign language professor.\nWorkload:\nModerate, considering the subject.  Homework every night - usually a couple of simple written activities, some reading, grammar review, and vocabulary.  MAKE SURE YOU KEEP UP WITH THE VOCABULARY.  Chapter tests once every two weeks, with vocab/grammar quizzes in between.  Short essay topics are assigned the day of the test and are due for the next class.  Comprehensive final at the end of the semester.  Relatively charitable grading.  Very reasonable, all in all.\n"
