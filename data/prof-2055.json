            "review_content": "\nColin is a successful novelist and book editor who has helped at least one GS writing student get published. You have to listen closely, because he doesn't say much, but he does offer excellent criticism to students he thinks are worthy. But don't be fooled by his humor and apparently casual attitude. He's merciless toward students who are not professional material. And he'll tell you so, but not until the last class. That's when he offers his philosophy about how to be a successful author: \"It's okay to be an asshole, as long as it all goes into your writing.\" Right.  \nWorkload:\nthree short stories per semester. and they better be good.\n"
