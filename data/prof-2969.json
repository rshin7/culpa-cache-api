The class I took with her was an organizational disaster: she was often late, she often lost homework assignments, and all we did was go around the room reading aloud from a not terribly good Hindi novel.  I can't say for sure if the novel got better because the class ended long before we got through reading it. I certainly didn't learn anything. Make no mistake: staffing of lower-level language courses at MEALAC is such that the only way to actually learn Hindi is to hope for a good TA.  Dr. Pritchett was an excellent introductory Hindi teacher, but she unfortunately no longer teaches lower level classes.  Dr. Parveen is a nice person and a very poor teacher.  \nWorkload:\nnot too bad, though not too clear what we were supposed to be doing.\n"
