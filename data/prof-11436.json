            "review_content": "\nI would not recommend this class at all. Although I initially thought Professor Muir was an engaging professor and interesting person, my thoughts quickly changed. She requires a lot of weekly reading, which seemed redundant immediately because she would lecture about what we read the next day in class. Unfortunately, Professor Muir does not encourage her students to think by themselves, but rather encourages reiteration and regurgitation of the thoughts of the authors that we read as well as her own. During lecture, she tended to repeat the same sentence four or five times just in a different way, which was not only frustrating but also pointless and made the class seem insignificant and (again) redundant.\nWhat I found most irritating about this class and the professor, unfortunately, was the lectures seemed superficial and overwhelmingly pretentious. Since the material of the course is extremely interesting and engaging, I do not discourage anyone from taking this course with another professor, but certainly suggest NOT TAKING THE COURSE WITH PROFESSOR MUIR. You will undoubtedly be disappointed. \nWorkload:\nLecture attendance required\nDiscussion section--TAs seemed confused about the direction of the course/material\nHeavy weekly reading which was unnecessary \nOccasional 1 page reflections due during lecture\n1 midterm, 1 final--both of which were given to students (exact copies) before the exam dates and discussed in lecture & discussion section\n"
