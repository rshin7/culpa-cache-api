He does tend to emphasize conversation more than lessons, so if you need the grammar to be explained to you, he doesn't really do that, and when he does, he does it in rapid French. A good introductory class for someone who is already a little into French or has experience learning languages, but not ideal for a total newcomer. He's really nice and makes sure you get the highest grade you deserve, but is sometimes a little too focused on fluency and not the basics.\n\nWorkload:\nCompositions, quizzes, tests, oral participation, and midterm and final\n"
