However, he is a very cute old man that shows a lot of videos and there is a ginormous curve.  The only thing you really have to do to study for the class is fill out his study questions and know them backwards and forwards.  Also for the essay part of the test write a ton. He\u2019ll say write as much as you need but ignore that advice and vomit everything you know onto the blue book and you\u2019ll do better than if you actually make a structured argument.  The multiple choice questions can sometimes be worded strangely but he tries to account for this by letting you throw out 2-3 questions per test depending on how many questions there are.  Also, there is the occasional homework assignment that if you put even the slightest amount of effort into you\u2019ll get a \u201cgreat!\u201d written as feedback.\n\nWorkload:\noccasional homework assignments, 3 equally weighted tests\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Balsam, as the previous reviewer said, has really been misrepresented.  Before you continue reading, I am going to preface this by saying that I am a Neuroscience major and pre-med and did well in the class; perhaps the negativity in the other reviews stems from the fact that those students did not receive an A.  \nI found his class to be one of the easiest classes I have ever taken.  Yes, there is some math...but seriously, it's just basic algebra, nothing a Barnard student isn't capable of.  If you read the book, go to class and take notes, and study for the tests, there really is no reason why you can't get anything less than an A- on his tests; they are very straightforward.  Plus, he lets you throw out three questions on the test!  Can't go wrong with that.  \nTo do well on his tests, read the book and answer his study questions to the best of your ability.  Any questions you have on those can be brought to Balsam who is so wonderfully accessible to his students.  He really does care and it's quite refreshing to have a professor who cares as much as he does. \nSpeaking of how much he cares, Professor Balsam is an incredible resource.  He has the most amazing connections, especially at the Columbia Medical Center (he also his own psychology/neuro lab at the medical center for those of you who are interested in his research).  For those students out there who are looking to find a lab at the medical center, Balsam is the guy to go to.  Trust me, he is so nice and friendly...he will hook you up with the lab of your dreams!  \nWorkload:\nTwo tests and a final (not cumulative).  Easy problem sets due every so often that help you practice the material and give you points.  Light, very manageable!\n"

While he certainly is not perfect at teaching, he's one of the most understanding and kind professors I've encountered (and I'm a senior)! His humor is definitely quirky, in a sweet dad kind of way, but once you've got it, he's hilarious. He also really cares about his students and gives excellent feedback and invests time to further their comprehension. He's always looking to improve and asks for feedback- and actually implements it.\nI would advise any psych or neuro student to develop a relationship with him and neuro students! Be in his seminar! \nTo do well on the tests, read the textbook and take notes. The textbook is dense, but plow through! His questions are based almost solely on it. He can tell who shows up to class, so its a good idea to go.\n\nWorkload:\n3 Tests\nCute easy homework that are really just there for attendance.\n"

Like the previous commenter said, Balsam's lectures can get kind of boring at times, but he is definitely not a horrible professor. In fact, he's a genuinely nice guy who really wants his students to succeed. He adds videos wherever he can and is generally organized and clear. He is available outside of class hours and he even set up a chat room the night before both of our midterms where we could log on and ask him questions. The tests are typical for a psych class, and yes you do have to read the book, but this is a college course, so you should expect to have to do some work. He even posts reading guides for all of the chapters, which are extremely helpful. Don't let the bad reviews scare you away from taking this course. Balsam is nice, friendly, and really cares about the material (and you might even learn something, which is something the previous posters seem to be opposed to). I also recommend taking the lab with Ken Light--the lab and the lectures lined up pretty nicely and we were able to get extra practice on the equations introduced in lecture.\nWorkload:\nLight-- 2 midterms and a final (non-cumulative). Standard for a psych class. A couple of small assignments that were easy and only counted for a handful of points. \n"

Professor Balsam may not be the most interesting lecturer, but he's far from horrible. He makes jokes and shows video clips and tries to engage the class more so than most professors. the material isn't hard either and neither are the exams - if you've ever taken a psych class before you should understand exactly how to study for one. Definitely take notes in class but reading the book is not necessary until before an exam - and even then you only have to read the book to answer the questions he posts after each lecture. study the answers to these questions and the tests should be a piece of cake. \nWorkload:\n2 midterms (non-cumulative) and a final. all very manageable and straightforward - just answer the questions he posts and take notes in class. \n"

Professor Balsam is an absolutely disastrous professor; he is boring, confusing (and confused), condescending, and seems to have no grasp of proper written grammar. The material is about as dry as humanly possible, and Balsam makes it even worse by complicating it to the point of incomprehensibility and comparing every theory to his pathological fear of boats. Lecture is worthless, and the book is only a bit better. Studying is pointless, you'll do poorly no matter what because the exams make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Basically prepare yourself to watch your GPA free-fall into an abyss after this class. On the other hand, the lab is not bad at all, although not particularly interesting. Still, there is nothing that makes this class worthwhile; if it's required for your major I suggest rethinking your plan of studies. \nWorkload:\nThree exams, all terrible when you take them and even worse when you get them back. \n"

I don't understand how a LEARNING PSYCHOLOGIST could be the most ineffective teacher I've ever encountered.\nThe textbook is dense and the language is horrible. He clearly just likes it because his face is in it.\nHis lectures are very boring and he simplifies the material. He also always says annoying things like \"this is easy stuff guys\" \"dont worry guys\"\n...... if it's such easy stuff, then why do you have to curve every exam, with the median grade still being a B-.\nUnless you're a Psych wiz I don't think you can endure this class without wanting to punch Balsam in the face all the time.\nOne time a PHD candidate taught our class when Balsam was out and I realized how simple the material is, but how confusing he makes it. You're right Balsam, it's not rocket science--- you make it rocket science.\n\nWorkload:\nTwo Mid-terms and a Final Exam.\nExams are long and he doesn't SHUT UP during them. He gives multiple choice questions related to examples/experiments discussed in class (but not in textbook) without referencing them first--- so if you don't memorize all his examples you'll get these wrong.\nThe phrasing is also horrible and often grammatically incorrect.\n"

This class was absolutely horrible, the lectures are boring and you end up with only a handful of people attending. The textbook assigned is also incredibly dense and difficult to understand. As for the exams -- Professor Balsam needs to understand that this is an Intro level class. He is unclear about the content and when he tries to teach math he fails. The lab instructor ended up being the only reason I understood the math because she spontaneously decided to go over it in lab. In terms of getting help outside of class I would say that he is very unfriendly and unapproachable. He is borderline condescending and this is an opinion shared by numerous peers who were taking the class with me (even students just went in to pick up their exams found that he was rude). I got the impression that he did not have the capacity for patience with students asking intro-level questions; maybe he makes a much better graduate level professor.\nWorkload:\nLab is standard, group work once a week but the lab report you hand in is individual.

Prof Balsam in some ways does a good job at making the rather dry ideas more accessible through his numerous everyday examples.  However, I do not believe that makes up for his extreme arrogence and self involvement.  The last few weeks of the semester he decided to torture the people who came into class late, which in my opinion was grossly inappropriate, and frustrating to both the people who came in late, and those of us that had come on time.  The lab was by far the worst portion of the class.  The assignments were incredibly time consuming and didn't actually help you learn everything.  Additionally, there were 3 full APA papers, which is ridiculous for a 1.5 credit lab.  The new lab technician (Dr Florer) was unclear in her expectations, and completely inconsistent in her grading.  Although she seems like a nice person, she is highly emotional, and a disaster to have as a prof.  So, unless you have an enormous interest in the psych of learning, I would STRONGLY recommend that you find another class.\nWorkload:\nLecture: reasonable, 3 exams.
