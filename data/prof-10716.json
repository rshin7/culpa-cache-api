You barely even have to do the readings. Just go the lectures (Hugh gives stupid weekly quizzes to check if we went or not) and do the WIAs on time. I almost exclusively used the WIAs to study for midterm/final and did well; a lot of the problems were taken almost directly off the WIAs, but with different graphs/numbers.\nWorkload:\nbusy, busy, busy work that doesn't teach you anything remotely substantial. why hasn't Columbia deleted this class yet?\n"

I'm not going to comment on that; there are enough reviews that to cover every angle of it's horribleness. Hugh is a good leader to get you through this class. He's nice, understanding, smart, and really decent about deadlines. If you get him as your leader, stick with him. He's a tougher grader than some of the other section leaders. No, I didn't do as well as I'd hoped in this class. However, it was a more pleasant experience because I took it with him. \nWorkload:\nFrontiers workload. Readings (you should do them for the exams), WIAs (such a pain), term paper (busy work, but easy), midterm (nothing at all like anything you've seen already in frontiers, but you can't study for it), final (better than the midterm)\n"
