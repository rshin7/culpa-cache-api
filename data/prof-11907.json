            "review_content": "\nReally unfair course. Lecture is purely powerpoints. HW is radically different from lecture. You have to utilize the textbook in order to have ANY idea what the hw is about, and even then I only managed to figure it out from people who went to her office hours and asked what the hell is going on. She has office hours for undergrads and encourages you to go, simply because if you don't go you will never figure out the homework. Its a good thing that she posts hw solutions because that is how you learn from the class. Essentially, you learn after you flunk your hw grade.\nExams are 50% fair 50% impossible. This course is graded using a gaussian without a curve. BEST part about this course; you will find no material/help online since it is such a niche subject. You have been warned.\nWorkload:\nWeekly hw will take you 4-5 hours minimum. Usually more since you dont know what the hell is going on. And neither do your peers.\n"
