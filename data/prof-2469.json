            "review_content": "\nAndreea is the greatest lab TA ever.  I've had her for two semester now, and although she was rather shy the first semester, she became much more outgoing by the second, and made what could have been hellish labs for non-science majors into relatively fun experiences.  She took a tongue-in-cheek attitude toward the experiments that matched that of the students, and while she would roll her eyes at us when the labs never came out right, she genuinely didn't mind taking time to help anyone who didn't understand.  I wish that she was an actual teacher so I could keep going to class with her.  I felt that she more than any of my actual professors saw me as a person rather than a grade.\nWorkload:\nShe grades labs fairly, which means it's certainly not an automatic A.  She sometimes does fun things like going to the museum rather than doing a lab or assigning presentations.  Labs are done entirely within the lab period, meaning there is no homework.\n"
