            "review_content": "\nAvoid her at all costs. She is cruel and makes people cry. It would be one thing if her critiques made sense but she contradicts herself constantly. She has no empathy and is a stone-hearted bitch. She kicked someone out on the first day of class because they couldn't attend one of the field trips. She broke a student's project by shaking it to demonstrate its poor design. A student was having a family emergency and submitted an assignment late and she just said \"you should have done your work earlier then.\" Sure she's accomplished but she's a horrible professor and takes the fun out of making things. She sucks. \nWorkload:\nAbout 3-4 projects, 3 blogs posts and mandatory field trips. It doesn't seem like a lot but when she hates everything you do, it gets pretty stressful.\n"
