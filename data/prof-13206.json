I didn't learn anything in his class, but I suffered from the tedious amount of work and substantial criticism he gave my essays. His classes are often confusing and he is young and arrogant. Would not recommend taking his class if possible. \nWorkload:\nTypical amount for university writing. Lots of busywork every night that isn't graded. Manageable but extensive and heavy. \n"
