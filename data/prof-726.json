The professor has a way of breaking down complicated concepts, which not only makes you feel smart for understanding but gives you confidence to attempt to understand others. Who knew I would be able to calculate orbital periods of planets after the end of this course? Certainly not I! Seriously though, the class gave me a good working basic knowledge about the Earth, Moon and Planets which comes in handy every day. Every time I watch a science fiction movie about the solar system, this comes to mind. Articles about satellites and the discovery of Earth like planets, which are always on the news are no longer intelligible. The professor is also very approachable in the class but also office hours. I recommend this class to all. You won't regret taking it. (I am not a science major, took this as part of my Core)\nWorkload:\nHe hands out problem sets, which have the solutions on the back. Don't be fooled into thinking it's not going to carry any weight in the exams, because,.... that's exactly from where he picks the question he asks. Study the problem sets, and you will do great on the exams. There are 3 exams in total. No homework or assignments.\n"

The class is divided into two sections: first, calculate rotations, distance of stars and how they interact with other bodies in space, The second part is the evolution of stars and their lifespan. The first test is completely math based and the second test is math based and short answer.  This class is an easy A IF you go to class and pay attention. You cant just sign up and expect to show up for the review sections and ace the test. Also I felt for the most part I learned stuff but one of the questions on the final I felt like we had to completely memorize what he wrote and I feel like that isn't learning.  Also he would talk about stuff so deep it was almost irrelevant for the class because most of us were only taking it for the science requirement, My advice, this class gave me more stress than I wanted from a silly general ed class and I only missed class once or twice. There are better classes out there for the science requirement.  Applegate is awesome as a person but you could tell it was hard for him to explain something so complex to students who will not continue this area of study. FIND ANOTHER CLASS\nWorkload:\nHe gives out practice problems that are very similar to the test questions but that doesn't make the test any easier.  Some of his notes are very/too complex for an intro class. However he will drop one of your midterms if you bombed it but that puts more pressure for you to do well on the final. Too much stress!!! \n"

Because of this class my GPA went down, and come on, we ALL care about our grades and GPA's so trust me when I say this class is just plain crap. \nWorkload:\n10 review sheets that makes so sense.

Yes, it is true that his exams are just repeats of the problem sets, and that he doesn't give any homework. But these are probably two of the biggest problems of the class.\nYou don't learn anything-- his lecture style is painful, doesn't follow a logical flow, and is mind-numbingly boring especially as the semester progresses. And this stuff is actually pretty complex: it requires a lot of visualization which he was not able to provide despite his rotations of magic 8 balls around his head. To get the hang of this stuff, you need at the VERY least a globe that can spin on a tilted axis. An projected animated image of the rotating planets would make it even clearer... but he gave us nothing. \nTherefore, when you need to repeat it on the exam, it is almost literal regurgitation. Even though all the answers are provided to you before hand, memorizing them when you never grasped them in the first place (despite attending all of his lectures) is almost impossible. Explanation is the only way to understand something, and is the best way to be able to do well on a test. I know most people who take this course don't care about the subject matter, but even if your goal is just to get a good grade, there has to be SOMETHING of interest in the way it's taught.\nSecondly, optional problem sets? Yes, there are some students who do them diligently for their own good. But the majority of us are not like that. Even if you are, you don't go over them in class; if you're interested you could probably meet during office hours to chat about the homework but otherwise all you have as a resource to know if you're understanding the problems or not is a hastily handwritten solution set made by Professor Applegate. There is a reason that homework is usually assigned and checked!\nIf you are looking for an easy A, to learn a bit about astronomy, or even just to get through the science req--Do Not Take This Class.\n\nWorkload:\nNone, and this is BAD. \n"

The class is advertised that anyone with a basic high school understanding of math can be successful - and that may be technically true. I assumed that meant that there wouldn't be a whole lot of it. Instead, it was extremely math intensive and I was overwhelmed almost immediately. The one exam we had that wasn't math-based was graded harshly, so I was bummed about that. But he did warn us ahead of time that he cares about the details.\nApplegate is a great professor. If you like science and you are GOOD at mathy stuff, then take this class. Attendance is very optional, the knowledge is interesting, and Applegate is very funny. The mathiness killed me, but you may fare better in that respect.

Everything that will be on the exam is actually very basic and straightforward and the textbook explains very clearly, so open it and read it and do the problem sets to test your understanding before the exams. In my opinion, the textbook was very easy to read and helpful; I only studied from the book right before the final. The second half of the semester is heavily math-oriented but there are only a few difficult questions. Basically, you just need to plug numbers into a simple formula. Trust me, my math score on SAT was 500 and I loathe math and I was supposed to fail, but the book helped me understand fundamentals and was still able to get a B in the end.   If I opened the book sooner and studied for midterms, I could have gotten an A for this class.     \nWorkload:\nNo homework. absolutely nothing to hand in.  2 midterms (even if you scored below average, your final grade determines your final letter grade, or I would have failed or ended up getting a C-.)\n"

The review sessions he offers before each test are absolutely useless, don't even bother with them.  My biggest gripe, though, is that if you are a student with a dissability and you take the tests with ODS, he does not treat you with the same respect he treats the other students with - you won't get your exams back in a timely manner as the rest of the class does.  He did not grade our exams at the same time as the rest of the class's, so we didn't get them back for about another week and a half.  Further, he promised me several times he would get them graded by the \"next class\" and it never got done.  Only after an administrator from ODS contacted him, did we recieve our graded tests.  I was absolutely shocked that he thought he could treat students with dissabilities with such nonchalance and when questioned about it he acted as if it was no big deal that he blew us off and that, in fact, it was quite all right to do as if our tests were more difficult to grade.

Applegate likes to ramble a lot and repeats himself at the beginning of every class. \nI only took this class to finish my science requirement, so if you are looking for an easy way out I recommend this course. However, if you don't want to be bored out of your mind every class, don't do it. \nWorkload:\nvery light - 3 exams, including the final. as long as you attend the review sessions and complete the review problems you will know all the material for the class. \n"

In the beginning of the semester I thought Applegate was funny/amusing/quirky and the class was not boring; towards the end it did start to get extremely boring. As other reviews have said he could have given the lectures in about half an hour. Its not a joke class, but it is a relatively painless way to fulfill the science requirement -- the material isn't incomprehensible and if you study it is very possible to get an A. \nWorkload:\ntwo mid terms and a final\n"

            "review_content": "\nI feel like Jim Applegate was going through a rough divorce or something this semester, because he was hardly as carefree and funny as previous reviews stated. He did make the occasional joke, and could be sort of quirky, but he seemed like a battered dog or something. \nAside from that, this class is relatively painless in that there is no regular homework. The only disconcerting thing for non-science people like me is when the class abruptly switches from conceptual information (like which phases of the moon you can see from the north pole) to physics (how large a planet is if something orbits around it at such a speed), which requires me both to have to somehow remember formulae and do high school math that I didn't do well in high school, and can hardly remember now. That's the difference between the first and second midterm. One is conceptual, and one is physics. Unluckily for people like us, physics is most of the remainder of the class - and you keep thinking it might go away, but it doesn't. Until after the second midterm, and then with the 3 weeks left of class, you have a conceptual/physics together block, that is comforting, cuz you get what he's talking about again. The final is cumulative.\nIts true that most people don't go to class (its funny to see how much fuller that room is on test days), but I went to every class, and still felt abused by the second (physics) midterm. I don't really know what to tell you. He says that he bases your final grade on how you did on the final most of all, but I can't validate this because, as a previous review stated, his is the only grade I haven't gotten back yet, while all my other grades were submitted A WEEK AGO. \nBut Jim Applegate isn't a monster, but he isn't your best columbia professor either. I do think he's a guy doing his best who desperately wants to be liked, and is a nice man and kind of funny.\nWorkload:\n2 midterms, Final. 5-7 problem sets handed out, promptly followed by answers, upon which the tests are based. important to go to class if for nothing else than to pick up these papers.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI feel like I should warn people, because many kids probably read all these reviews and think that this really is going to be a joke class, and thateveryone will get an A.  Well, remember, there can never really be a class where everyone just gets A's, especially in a class with about 200 students (or more?). The whole reason there is that gigantic curve is because half of the kids fail the final miserably, so that the kids who thought they might just get B's end up getting A's. And the reason that half fails is because most of the students never go to class. Really, MOST of them don't go. Applegate even acknowledges this. He likes it. \nHe said once in class that he's glad, because the classroom can only fit like 100 students. So you really CAN'T have everyone go to class all the time. It's just ridiculous that they would even set up a class like that at Columbia, where you really are expected not to go to the class. The problem is, it's really hard to just learn the stuff on your own, even if it's not exactly rocket science. But you can't go to class all the time. The seats all fill up and then the overflow people have to sit on the floor. It sucks. That's if you even muster up enough motivation to go to class, which is very tough for a lot of people because it's so boring and stupid. \nLike some of the other reviews said, the only real information he gives out in his lecture takes about 25 minutes. The rest is just bull crap. \nReally. You almost can't believe it. The guy paces back and forth in front of the room, whether he's speaking or not. He reaches one wall and then does and about-face and marches right back to the other wall, over and over again. Sometimes there is just dead silence, while he's thinking of some stupid, inappropriate joke to say. So it's basically torture to sit through this one hour fifteen minutes class, for 25 minutes of information about basic astronomy/physics. And the reason that it's so hard to teach yourself this information is that, even though it is basic, it's very _specific_ stuff. You have to do the formulas and everything the way HE does them. So even if you are a science major with exceptional math and science skills you still couldn't just walk in and do the stuff. But apparently that is what Columbia expects of half of the students, the half that probably AREN'T science majors because they're just taking this class for an easy A to fulfill the science requirement. But there still aren't enough seats for this half of the class to actually attend the lecture, even if they will themselves to put up with a full class of torture for about 20 minutes worth of information. Fair warning to all--this class is not a joke. \nA LOT of people get A's, but that's mostly because a LOT more do terribly on the midterms/finals. It's better to take a science class that may be a little harder, but will be more interesting to you than astronomy with some strange professor, so that you might actually go to class sometimes AND actually have a seat to sit in when you go.\nWorkload:\n2 midterms, final on which most of the final grade is based\n"
