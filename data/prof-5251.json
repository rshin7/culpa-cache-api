            "review_content": "\nIt was a pleasure being in Julie's class this semester. I was originally a little disappointed since I had hoped to enroll in Steve Baker's class, but ultimately Julie was kind, a little silly, and her bubbly personality made learning italian really enjoyable. She expects participation and expects you to have done the assignments and will call on you in class. \nHomework is about the same as it was for intermediate italian 1, maybe a little more writing but overall there is not a steep curve between this course and the last. \nMy only issue and something I know people worry about is that she is NOT a native speaker, and I believe Italian is her 3rd language. There were a few times when I felt that she was struggling to speak along with the student. However, this did not hinder my learning of the language. \nWorkload:\nDaily assignments, 7-8 compositions, two in-class presentations, midterm and final\n"
