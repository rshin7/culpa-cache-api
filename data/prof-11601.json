            "review_content": "\nSpends half of the year in Italy. Very thick accent, difficulty in understanding students questions.\nApparently this year was changed drastically from last year. Last year he taught a lot of the in depth math associated with fluid dynamics, and had a midterm and a final on it. As well as a final project you work on through out the year. And some homeworks.\nThis year we've had 1 homework, there are no tests, and we still have a final project. He still lectures every day on the in depth math behind fluid dynamics, \"so we have a solid background of the subject\". I don't follow along mostly. There are times when we do interesting things that aren't just derivations, such as critical velocities of rivers and their slopes.\nThere are 7 people in the class. \nThe final project is such that we are all working on the Hudson river bay area. There are 3 groups of 2/3 people in each group. Topics are Sediment transport, tidal power, storm surge mitigation. There is a preliminary \"midterm\" presentation and then a final presentation. \nWe also meet with the TA once a week after class and he shows us how to do modeling on the computer.\nWorkload:\nvery light work load.\n"
