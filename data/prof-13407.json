This was a non-themed section (contemporary essays), and he brings in ideas from critical and cultural theory that I enjoyed. Notebook assignments and drafts are graded on completion, and they're pretty helpful in developing your ideas. Kent offers helpful feedback, especially if you discuss your work in office hours, that I felt refined my thinking and helped me write more focused, developed essays. I don't think he was very harsh of a grader, although I can't compare his grading standards with those of other UW instructors.\nWorkload:\nBiweekly notebook assignments, as well as two drafts and a final copy for 4 progressions\n"
