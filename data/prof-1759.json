He NEVER makes you feel bad, even if what you've written is total garbage.  He has a nice balance of positive and negative criticisms.... A little bit of a tough grader despite his laid back attitude and numerous tattoos (ask about them and he'll explain each one for you).... Always helpful and insightful. Highly recommended!\nWorkload:\nNot bad AT ALL -- one poem, one short story, one piece of drama and a portfolio at the end of all edited work... MUST attend all classes and don't be late! And make sure you REALLY edit well if you expect an A.  Very manageable workload.\n"
