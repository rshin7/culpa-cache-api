She is an absolutely amazing TA who is a great facilitator of discussion, very knowledgable, and extremely engaging. She is also very helpful for those who wish to meet with her oustide of class, hand in drafts, or ask additional questions. Not a hard grader as far as I could tell. No real flaws here and someone who can truly help you become a better reader, interpreter and writer of history and leads an interesting discussion.\nWorkload:\nAbout 150 pages of reading per week---sometime denser than others, but pretty decent books if you're into the period. One 10-12 historiography research paper which you will have to read two additional books for but is relatively straight forward. A midterm and a final which have pretty general questions that shouldn't be hard to answer if you have done the reading and gone to most of the lectures. The midterm is one essay and the final is two essays and some quote IDs from primary source documents (don't have to ID exactly just the kind of person who would have said it and when).\n"
