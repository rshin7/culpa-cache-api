The instructor is really encouraging and personable. \nI'm not sure if this goes for every gym class but you can skip 6 of these classes all semester, for being sick or for studying for finals. You might not want to use these like 2-3 in a row, but it's definitely convenient.\nThe instructor is very well-taught. I think he studied with the person who created iyengar yoga, which is just a type of yoga that uses a lot of blocks, mats, belts, and stuff. Essentially, s&m; yoga, without any of the creepy violent implications that that term carries.\nWorkload:\nnothing! it's phys ed!\n"
