Very, very straightforward, powerpoint slides and very little flexibility, but a pretty nice guy who teaches the material well. Never saw him once out of class, even if I wanted to -- of course, I didn't, so it was OK.\nYou're only taking this class because it's required, but he's an okay guy and not a bad teacher.\nWorkload:\nA little tough -- homeworks aren't too long, but are sometimes hard, exams are pretty average. Two textbooks, one of which is almost entirely useless.\n"
