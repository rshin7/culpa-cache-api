            "review_content": "\nIf you like Earth Science, TAKE.  THIS.  CLASS.  One question on the final was \"trace an atom of Iron from the big bang to your body.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  And you can do it by the end of the class!  How cool is that?\nTerry is an incredible lecturer.  I don't think her TedTalk is up on YouTube yet, but she practiced it on us and it was only slightly more inspiring and engaging than her typical lecture format.  She does a great job presenting science as a story: a chronological story of where molecules came from and how they came together to make the Earth and Solar System as we know it (starting with the Big Bang and ending with how copper mines work), and a story of trial and error by scientists.  It's really a joy to have her as a professor, whether you have an intense academic interest in the material or just have a layman's fascination.\nI took Solid Earth before this class and Climate concurrently.  I think this is a great way to do things.  From the very start, Terry throws around names of minerals and rocks and geological time periods without always explaining what they are.  While you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to know much about them to get what she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saying, the Geochemistry material will be a lot more meaningful if you have a working familiarity with the geology and everything will be easier to remember if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t learning the mineralogy/petrology vocabulary at the same time.  We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover climate topics until the last third or so of the semester.  By that point, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re co-enrolled in Climate, some of it is a nice review of what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been doing in that class.  Terry is a lot less comprehensive in going over things like Milankovitch oscillations than the Climate course is, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure those parts of the Geochemistry material would be a lot tougher without some Climate background.\nIn terms of Chemistry, if you never really got GenChem, this class is going to be a lot tougher for you.  If you want to spend a couple weeks reviewing over the summer or something, practice balancing equations, equilibrium constants, energy of reactions, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mass balance\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (mixing two solutions and figuring out the concentrations in the end solution), and alpha/beta/gamma decay.  It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing beyond GenChem, but deeply understanding the chemistry will make it much easier for you to focus on geological applications. Orgo is a very small topic in this class and you only need a very cursory understanding (Carbons bond together, they make chains sometimes and rings sometimes).  Terry does quickly review all of these topics in class but, if you have trouble with all of them, that is going to add up.\n\nWorkload:\nThe reading is not necessary, but the problem sets and studying for the tests can take some time.  You will also need to devote about half a day to participating in some way in a research project: collecting rock samples or shooting them with lasers at Lamont or playing with an Excel spreadsheet.  As another reviewer mentioned, you need to take very thorough notes because her powerpoint slides are adorable and helpful but do not stand alone as a study tool.  There's a decent curve (probably bumped my grade up 5%) and once you've seen her first test you know what to expect.  Problem sets and tests are worth about the same, so you have a lot of control over your grade.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI cannot believe no one has written a review of Prof. Plank before.\nIn short, she is my hero. She is nice, SUPER-approachable, down to earth (literally), and, despite the fact that she is a MACARTHUR GENIUS, extremely humble. \nThis class is also extremely interesting and enjoyable, though definitely not easy. The subject matter is presented as a story, taking you from the formation of the elements in the stars, to the sun, the earth, the crust, the continent, the oceans, all the way to how the elements behave in river chemistry. Despite the storybook format, the topics can be quite technical, and will draw pretty heavily on your Gen Chem knowledge.\nHer tests ask you to draw on very specific details, so beware--they're pretty tough. Her lectures go fast, and they make complete sense when she explains them, but when you go back, her notes by themselves don't make much sense. TAKE NOTES LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.\nIf you're a DEES major or if you've taken Chemistry and want to learn something fascinating from the coolest person on earth, then take this class. Prof. Plank deserves a gold nugget.\nWorkload:\nReadings that you KINDA have to do. 4 Problem Sets which WILL take a long time (mostly because her instructions aren't very clear) that are each worth 8%. Analytical Project that was actually a lot of fun because you get to zap things with a laser and feel like a scientist. 2 tough midterms (worth 15% each) and a final (23%)\n"
