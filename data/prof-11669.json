            "review_content": "\nI loved this course. It was small, student focused, and involved wonderful readings. Both professors were incredibly kind and had meticulous comments on assignments. They knew when to push a student or when to pull back and offer support, essential for this kind of class in which the students are asked to open themselves up and reveal vulnerabilities.\nA typical class would look like:\n15-20 minutes of introduction by the professors\n60-75 minutes of discussion\n5 minutes of free writing based off a prompt\n10-15 minutes of reading and discussion\nI took this course because as a pre-medical student, I always thought that a narrative medicine course would offer a valuable perspective. It did. It may have been obvious at times and sentimental, I still enjoyed it very much overall.\nSometimes, we had too many readings to have a thorough discussion on any one. That said, I read all of the readings, and I sometimes wished I had more to read. I was definitely inspired to put in extra time and effort beyond what the class would have requested of me.\nI would definitely recommend this course. \nWorkload:\nBrief (2-3 paragraphs), weekly discussion posts in response to a question; weekly reading (i.e. one book or several shorter readings); midterm paper (5-7 pages); final paper (12-15 pages)\n"
