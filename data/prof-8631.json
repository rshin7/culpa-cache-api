            "review_content": "\nSeth is the real deal.  I have never had a professor expend so much effort on reading and evaluating student work. He is so available to meet to discuss papers and such.\n The classes are a pleasure, really, no kidding- he runs the gambit of organizing and facilitating discussion in a way that I have never seen before.  You actually want to do the work for this class.  He is really funny, but oddly serious.  I never thought someone could be both- but he is.\nThe workload was 3 papers and precis statements- the precis project changed my life (again, not kidding) and made writing so much more easy and pleasant. I think I got better grades in other classes because of Halvorson.  He also has a very clear set of standards of evaluating student work.  He handed out a rubric for how he grades- he sticks to it and it makes a lot of sense. \nTake a class from him, you will not regret it.   He loves CC, it is obvious and he works to make the class accessible and excellent for everyone- even some of the students who don't pull their weight. He is probably too kind with the dolts, but Seth is one of the best professors I have ever had.  \nWorkload:\nHe has high standards but is fair.  After he read a lot of our work he introduced a precis project, where you write a one-page response paper.  At first I didn't believe him that it would help, but it really did. Halvorson is unique, you really want to do the work, just so you can keep up and talk with him.  BTW: he really cares about the verbs you use.  \n"
