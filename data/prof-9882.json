If you have to take this class, take it with anyone else.  It just has to be better.\nShe misspeaks in class all the time.  Makes no effort to know anyone's name.  Offers no practical advice on management, but instead offers only common sense tips.  She'll grade you on your powerpoint, but doesn't seem to know how to use it herself.  Because her lectures lack any substance, the recitations are also a waste.  (Although the TAs were very nice.)  Plus, there is no incentive to do any of the readings for the class, as they are never talked about in class or used in assignments.  (So don't bother buying any of the books.)\nWorkload:\n2 group projects, 1 individual response paper to a group's project (2 pages), 3 memos (2 pages + supporting docs), Final is another 2 page memo + supporting docs\n"
