I would recommend to all German students that they buy Schaum's Outlines of German Grammar (any bookstore will have it in the study aids section). It is much more systematic and clearer than the text book, which really sucks. Use it for reference, to fill in gaps in the text books exposition of german grammar, and you will go far.\n"
