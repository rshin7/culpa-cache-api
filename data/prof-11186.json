            "review_content": "\nSitting in Professor Hom's class, I could tell that she truly cared about whether the students understood the concepts she presented because she stopped to throughly explain questions students asked. Her lectures are outlined very well so that come midterms/finals study time you should have comprehensive and organized notes. Her exams are very fair so long as you do all of the practice problems she assigns as well as take the time to actually do the homework. The final was the toughest out of all her exams, but thats probably because the later material is harder to grasp and the final is comprehensive but has a definite focus on the untested materials we learned in class.\n\nWorkload:\nWeekly assignments\nTwo Midterms\nFinal \n"

            "review_content": "\nSo keep in mind that this is a Calc class so don't expect it to be inspiring in anyway. Like any other math class: dry, straightforward, hard, and time consuming if you are aiming for an A. Hom is very straightforward and basically copies down the book on the board while explaining the concepts. This is all I need from a professor so lectures were very helpful to me. The class is boring and you feel like %90 of material are useless, especially if you are an Econ major.\nThe HW is from the textbook, nothing crazy, and if you are stuck she will walk you through the problem in her office hours. There are usually 2-3 people in her office so you never have to wait that long for your turn which is rare in other classes. They are usually graded within a week. Make sure you do the problems yourself as they are crucial in getting a good grade 19.5/20\nFirst midterm: It was nightmare. There is so much material within the first half of the class that unless you are a math genius it will be impossible to get an A on. Also the multiple choice questions are really tricky. I lost 8 points just on multiple choice. There is also one distance question that most people including me lost points on. I got a 39/60 while the average was a 38 I think.\nSecond Midterm: After freaking out about my first midterm I sat down from a week ahead and did every single HW and review problem for the sections that were on the exam. I ended up with 55/60 ( lost 4 points in multiple choice and 1 point due to not knowing how to add and subtract) The average was 49/60. Much easier than the first exam.\nFinal: So try to manage your time for the final. There is a tremendous amount of material that you need to know. If you know them the questions won't be that hard. You won't run out of time but you will most likely be stuck on one or two questions. I ended up with a 77/100. Have no idea what the average was.\nShe curves the class to either a B or a B+.\nFinal course grade: A-\nWorkload:\n2 Midterms %40 , Second one very easy. weekly problem sets %20 which got smaller and smaller towards the end of the semester. Final %40, which was relatively hard.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Hom acts like an adorable 10-year-old who actually does an excellent job teaching you calculus. Her class is pretty much all I could ask for in a math course: straightforward, fair, and curved fairly generously.\nShe teaches very methodically, and even though the notes she writes on the board are fairly similar (if not identical) to the textbook, she does an effective job teaching you the material. I had never taken multivariable calc before (just BC calc in high school) so almost everything we learned was new to me. Yes, I'll admit the lectures aren't always the most engaging, but it's a math class \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how much flexibility does the professor have in terms of being creative? She teaches the theory and then works out example problems. When things get boring, or if she makes a mistake, she tells us a Chuck Norris joke or a funny story about her niece. It's adorable.\nThe exams are pretty fair. The first exam was definitely trickier than the second exam, which was as straightforward as you could possibly imagine. The final was definitely tougher than the midterms, with the average being around a 66%. However, there was a very generous curve for everyone's final course grade, as even people who had an average of a little over 85% uncurved ended up with A's. If you do your homework (which we affectionately referred to as Homwork) and actually understand what you're doing (not just copying from Chegg), you'll have no problem with the exams. I never went to Hom's office hours since I just checked my homework with and asked questions to friends of mine in the class.\nOverall, JHom is a great choice for Calc III. TAKE HER CLASS AND ENJOY THE CHUCK NORRIS JOKES!!!\nWorkload:\n2 Midterms (Each 20%), 1 Final (40%) and about 20-30 homework problems per week (Total of 20% of course grade). The homework does take a couple hours but I think it appropriately reinforces the material. Honestly, it's not too much, nor is it too little.\n"

            "review_content": "\nTAKE JENNIFER HOM!!!! She explains math like we are a class of 5th grade students, which is largely appreciated when the topic is multivarible calculus. For this same reason, she is quite adorable in class and commonly tries to integrate chuck norris jokes and stories about her niece into her lecture. Even if everyone is not a fan of her psets, they love Hom as a person. \nThe book explains calculus rather well, and you can pass the midterms/do all the psets without ever going to lecture, but go to lecture anyway. She explains calc better than the book does, she goes over practice problems that come up in the psets but are not explained in the book, and you'll actually save time by going to lecture vs skipping. She rarely asks for student input during lectures and when working out problems. This is really nice as you probably forgot a lot of trip/calc I/Calc II, but she also reviews the calc I/trig needed for certain topics. That being said, sometimes her lectures are really fast (with absolutely no bullshiting!) and you can easily get lost. Thankfully, she will stop to answer any question. Once a student said \"CAN YOU PLEASE SLOW DOWN!?!!!!!\" and instead of being offended, Hom completely stopped where she was, and went through the steps very slowly, re-explaining each part. So if you don't get something through lecture, its generally your fault; ask questions, or she will assume you get it. Oh, Sometimes her classes get out early =)\nOffice hours are very useful and she will hold midterm review sessions on some of those offices hours, going to one saved my ass on a midterm after I had skipped lecture for a few weeks. \nShe doesn't use webassign!!!!!! WOO!!! Though sometimes the grading by TAs makes absolutely no sense; like once I got a 8/20 on a pset I thought I did genuinely well on, another time I got \"bro, I can't read your handwriting\" was rewarded with a 6/20 (p.s. I could read that shit!). Despite my horrible pset grades and bad final (understood all the material but didn't memorize the necessary formulas, did well on midterms) I still passed the class. \nYou will have no clue what your letter grade for the class is during the semester and you are just going to have to live with it.\n One last note, there is no arguing about a grade on a midterm. I (and others) went up to her after the midterms were passed back to dicuss the partial credit we recieved and every response was the some variation of \"well yes, but you didn't do that so this is the credit you recieve\". Sometimes frustrating, but of no great consequence. If you want a calc teacher that explains the topic very well, gives a reasonable workload, doable midterms/finals, and is accessible, take Hom! \nWorkload:\nNot bad at all if you are a SEAS major, pretty horrible if you are an econ major. There is a pset due every week and the problems are announced well in advanced on her website. They usually take about 2-3 hours and are really straightforward with the exception of 1-2 problems at the end (again, some will rant that the psets are ridiculous, but those people have never taken physics). The method to solve these harder ones are usually explained in lecture but not in the book; regardless, a trip to office hours will save you much headache as she will explain how to solve any problem. There are 2 midterms that are rather easy if you memorize the formulas/know when to apply them, but as mentioned in the review before, have a multiple choice section that requires a true understanding of the material. The final was a rather difficult, but the class had a VERY generous curve.\n"

She explains things better than the textbook and thus makes going to class worth it, even if you REALLY REALLY REALLY don't want to...which was me most of the time. \nIf you take her class though, be prepared to really understand the material. No longer can you just memorize formulas. You have to really get it. Her true-false questions and sometimes-always-never questions on the exam insist on it. \nHer class is not an easy A. Her exams are kinda hard. Her final was soooo long. But whatever. Those days can suck. If you want to really understand calc III (but really though, why would you?), Hom is your lady. \nLong story short--I am not a math person. I did ok. You can too. Hom is a pretty good professor. She talks about her niece a lot.\nWorkload:\nWeekly hw (actually, these were SUPER long, but she uses a lot of odds thank god), two midterms (kinda hard, not awful, nice curve), and a final (same as midterms, but SO SO SO long. god. 13 pages.

I really didn't catch on to her much (as a teacher) at the beginning, but she missed one day and another professor taught in her place, and suddenly I realized how lucky I was to have Hom.\nShe's brilliant at math, and she is extremely helpful in her office hours.  She assigns a lot of homework and her favorite problems are the \"post-40's\" in the math book, i.e. those towards the end of the chapter that are lengthy and conceptual, so at times they can be somewhat esoteric and difficult to understand.  GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING, SHE'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET IT.  \nAs far as tests go, her initial test averaged a 45/60 and her second a 51/60.  In all honesty, the first one was pretty brutal but the second one was very straight-forward and easy to understand if you did your homework.\nTake Hom, she's not bad!\nWorkload:\n2 midterms (20%), one final (40%), lengthy problem sets (20%, 3 problems on each graded randomly... check for accuracy or your grade will suffer..  lowest homework grade dropped)\n"

More than that, she's very straightforward about what she's looking for from her students. I was a little frustrated by a few of my homework grades -- homework is graded on correctness, but only three of the problems are actually graded, so if it just happens to be the three problems you didn't know you're completely screwed. Also, the TAs grade, which obviously gets messy at times. However, if you are taking this class to meet a requirement, I'd definitely recommend Jennifer Hom -- you'll learn a lot with minimal stress.\nWorkload:\nWeekly homework, 3 exams, 1 final -- some of the problem sets are difficult and lengthy, but other than that very low stress\n"

Professor Hom was more than fair in her preparation and grading, and she told us exactly what to expect before both midterms and the final. However, a word of caution: since the tests are so easy, the class average was very high, and Professor Hom still curved to a B or B+, so I got an A- with an un-curved average of a 90%.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets that are partially graded for correctness.\n"
