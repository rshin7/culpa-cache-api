            "review_content": "\nI had Kim Yao Spring Semester of 2005 and I was surprised to find no one had written a review of her. I suspect that is because Kim is very very good, but might not inspire a fan base. Kim is thoughtful and attentive at desk crits, well organized, and fair in her critiques. She's not trying to push bounderies and shock students into or out of architecture like may professors who seem to feel the need to assume an \"uber-maven\" persona. She was always understandable and there was very little bullshit, if she lapsed into jargony arkhitectur-speak  she usually was self-effacing about it and laughed it off. That was a tremendous breath of fresh air and I hope I have professors like her in grad school. \nWorkload:\nFirm but fair. The minimum required workload was substantial, but you could easily spend 30 hrs a week in the studio if you wanted to. She was very easy going with due dates, however, and would give ample time to tweak projects post-review.\n"
