            "review_content": "\nA really fun course in microbio techniques. Prof. Dietrich really loves the material and shows it, both in how he lectures and how he helps you troubleshoot your results. You do two experiments, each taking about six weeks. In the first, you isolate and identify bacteria that you find in New York City. In the second, you do a transposon screen on P. aeruginosa to find phenazine regulatory genes. The TA's I had were really nice and would often meet with students outside of class to help them figure out what data meant. Professor Dietrich himself would work each student every class period, and really give me the guidance I needed to figure out what was going on. \nWorkload:\nIt's five credits for a reason, although it's fun. You have to do a lab presentation for you midterm and produce a paper for your final, both of which are moderately time consuming (especially writing during reading week.) You may also need to come in during weekends to monitor your bacteria. Still, a really fun course if you put in the effort. \n"
