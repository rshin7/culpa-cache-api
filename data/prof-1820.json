            "review_content": "\nFrances has been my favorite professor thus far at Columbia and Intro to Latino studies has been my favorite class. I'm even considering majoring in Latin American studies after taking this class. For the love of God do yourself a favor and take this class (it unfortunately isn't offered 2013-2014 but if it is later TAKE IT). The whole class is super interesting, and she's always including video clips and other media to make the topics current. This is probably the easiest/ most interesting way to fulfill a global core requirement. There are optional discussion sections. My TA was really cool and the sections were actually pretty helpful. \nWorkload:\nTake home midterm, ethnography report of a Latino neighborhood (2 pages), interview with a Latino (2-3 pages), final paper/project, weekly one page responses to the readings. Sometimes a lot of reading but you can skim it and still write a decent response. Pretty painless\n"

            "review_content": "\nAMAZING CLASS! Professor Negron-Muntaner never had a dull moment in class. She always would relate lectures to media, and she would also constantly relate teachings to what was happening in the world at the time. She was intimidating (she talked to us about how she met with the president during the semester and she would talk to us about other celebrities whom she has worked with--J. LO, Eva Longoria, Junot Diaz, etc), but this just made the class all the more interesting to attend. That being said, I think you have to really enjoy what was being taught to truly get the best out of the class. If you're interested in Latino culture at all TAKE THIS CLASS! \nWorkload:\nALOT of assigned reading, but you really don't need to do them at all. they are all gone over during class. One in-class presentation on a reading, interview of a Latino in NYC, take home midterm, final take home paper. Very easy to get an A-/A/A+ if you do all the work. \n"

She is perhaps the most knowledgeable professor I have encountered at Columbia and the class ended up being about so much more than the works we read. TAKE THIS CLASS! TAKE ANYTHING SHE'S TEACHING! She's amazing.\nWorkload:\nA lot of reading, one presentation, an optional extra-credit essay, a midterm (may be take-home), a final research paper (12-15 pages, but expect to write more)\n"

She is very open to ideas and thoughts from her students, and she will challenge you to make sure you have a clear understanding of the materials. Though the reading load was quite heavy, it was also very interesting. Make sure you do the reading and you'll do fine.\nWorkload:\nLots of reading, a midterm, and a 15 page final\n"

Negron is the best professor I've had at Columbia, and the only one that was so good I just had to take her twice. Even if your interests don't lie in this subject area, take a course with her--or four--anyway. They will be well worth your time.\n"

She is everything one can expect from a Prof. at an Ivy league institution.   If you can, take a class with her, she is worth the money , the time and the effort to read and go to class every day.  The lady is just great.!!\nWorkload:\nThe same amount as in any other class- do the reading-take notes and participate in class and you will be fine!!\n"

Her readings are very informative and varied, and they offer a wide range of analysis on the different social circumstances surrounding the different Latino ethnic groups in the United States.  That said, I have to add that even as a gay man, this class was SO overwhemlingly focused on homosexuality that it ended up seeming one-\nsided, even though we read lot's of works by straight authors as well.  This was my first English class at Columbia, and it was enjoyable because she had so much insight to offer.  Honestly I thought it was way too gay, but it also\ngave me a better understanding of how identity is constructed in this country.  Overall, a thumbs up.\nWorkload:\nLots of reading, but it's all reviewed in class and you don't need to do all of it, easy midterm, an informal presentation once/twice in the semester, final\n"

(OK, well, sometimes, but I still did it)  She is easy to talk to and interested to hear what the students have to say.  \nWorkload:\nFairly intense:  extra-large course packet, a list of at least 6 or 7 other books/novels.  Class participation, show up(she takes attendance) and at least one in-class presentation.  One take home midterm(not too bad), a 12-15 page term paper, and a final.\n"

Her door is always open and prefers your thoughts rather than just you summarizing what you've read. After taking two courses with her, she is in my book one of the best professors Ive had in Columbia. Any course with her would be a great experience.\nWorkload:\n3-5 interesting readings every week, 2 papers and an in class final. Even if its seems like a lot, she does cut and paste throughout the semester. You'll be fine!\n"

Caribbean literature had a $70.00 reader plus more than 5 novels. \nWorkload:\n A lot of reading but interesting..Take home midterm, 15 pg research paper and final. Short presentation on a novel\n"

Take advantage of her office hours, and go to the events she sponsors - they are never boring academic affairs but interesting and often lively (read: there is a heated debate and/or argument between panelists) events.\nWorkload:\n6-9 page paper, in-class presentation, longer research project due at end of semster, take-home midterm, short final.\n"

As a documentary filmmaker, she incoroporates multimedia into the class, including film adaptations of some of the readings.  She encourages class discussion, but keeps it focused.  I highly reccommend this class and any other she may be teaching.  Give this woman tenure!!!\nWorkload:\nin-class presentation, take-home midterm, final, research paper (12-15 pp)\n"

She's young, she's an artist, she makes documentaries, she knows famous people, she throws in random facts (\"about that time when i was interviewing Selena's brother ...\").  Her lit selections for the class are great.  It's all current stuff, and feels really new because not much criticism has been written on it yet.  It's clear this professor is on the cutting edge of her field.\nWorkload:\nA take home midterm, an in class final, and a 15 page research paper due at the end of the semester.  Go to class, it helps a lot and that's the best part.\n"
