            "review_content": "\nThis is a review for Prof. Shapiro's Fall 2013 seminar. (Side note -- think he's on sabbatical this coming year 2014-2015, but he'll be back after. Take his class. All of them.)\nI love Prof. Shapiro in lecture, and really glad I got to take a seminar with him. In this seminar, we read every single poem of Shakespeare's, which was simultaneously awesome and horrible. Every week we would focus on a couple of sonnets he wrote, or once we got into the longer poems, passages in, e.g. Venus & Adonis. In retrospect, you didn't even have to do all the reading, since we definitely didn't discuss all 116 or whatever sonnets that Shakespeare wrote, but I did all of them anyway and I think Shapiro inspires that kind of dedication (especially since he says in the beginning of class that everyone will get at least a B+). I kinda wish we had heard more of his voice in seminar, but I learned a lot from the other students in class which I guess is the point. \nFound the reading load to be doable, but I don't think I would ever call it 'light' ... we had a paper due every week (600-800 words) so it always felt like a scramble to get the reading and the paper done. 600 words doesn't sound like a lot, but when you have to come up with a good argument and back it up in 600 words AND make it a final draft (Shapiro is huge on revisions) it can be really difficult. I definitely think I became a better writer over the course of the semester, but I wish I had put in more effort and time, though there's only so many hours in a day (or a week). Shapiro graded our papers on a check/check-plus/check-minus scale and the highest grade I ever got was a check/check-plus. I do think there's some satisfaction in doing better on the papers, but also felt that Shapiro was purposefully harsher on grading in the beginning of the semester so it would seem like we all improved. Or maybe I actually did improve. Not sure. The writing workshop was super helpful though as were his comments (of which there were always many). \nWhen I write my papers for other classes now I definitely think about what Shapiro has said about my writing in the past and try to not make the same mistakes. In a workshop he had us all read anonymous sentences out loud from papers he'd gotten that week and fix them up -- it's really illuminating to read just one sentence out of dozens that you've written and realize how f***ing convoluted it is. Also he's super kind, and super funny. He told the greatest stories. \nTips -- do the reading early so you have time to come up with an argument and execute, go to office hours cause Shapiro is one of the most delightful profs I've taken at Columbia... a true gem in the English department here which is a gem in itself.\nWorkload:\n600-800 word paper due every week, with one pass, on the reading of that week, which was usually at least 50 pages, sometimes double that, of poetry. weeks with heavy reading (like all of Venus & Adonis, or all of Lucrece) was matched with no reading the week after since we'd spend two classes on discussion, etc. \n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Shapiro is a WONDERFUL professor.  He is enthusiastic, presents difficult material clearly and in a stimulating manner, and is extremely kind and approachable.  Acting out the plays in class clarified dense text and made it exciting.  The contextual information (political and social history, biographies of the play writes, etc) helped to create a trajectory in my head of how tragedies and comedies changed in response to one another and the period in which they were written.  \nThe only time I have had another professor give such critical feedback to my writing was in U Writing. Professor Shapiro puts a lot of thought into his comments to help his students strengthen their writing and thinking.  \nI would recommend everyone take a class with Professor Shapiro during their junior and/or senior year.  It may be more difficult for non-English majors, but his enthusiasm and clear teaching style makes the material less intimidating, and he works diligently to help students become better writers.\nGo to his office hours.  Seriously, go to them.  Shapiro is a boss in his field and one of the kindest professors I've ever met.  He loves getting to know his students one-on-one and is extremely helpful with his writing assignments if you actually show up and talk to him.\nWorkload:\nOne play a week with the first two acts read for Monday and finished by Wednesday.  Exams are very fair: midterm and final (not cumulative).  He provides a list of characters and in 10 words you have to identify them; a couple passage IDs pulled from material discussed and/or acted out in class; one or two quotes that you have to explain the significance of in 30 words or fewer.  Two essays during the semester: one 600-word theater review and another 2,100 word response to a very specific question regarding two plays.\n"

            "review_content": "\n]This was my favorite class of the semester by far. Shapiro is an incredible lecturer, and his passion for the works is truly infectious. I was hesitant to take this class because I wasn't super interested in the material (1600s non-Shakespeare drama), but he definitely changed that for me. He jokes that he lives in that time period, but he really does seem to have an endless amount of knowledge.\nHe began every play talking about the playwright and situating him in the time period, and we generally acted out one (or sometimes more) scene(s) from each play -- Shapiro is big on the theatrical aspect of the works and how you feel in the setting, whether it's a big theater or a small theater, etc. We learned a lot about that sort of stuff which not every professor does. Also acting out the plays was hilarious to watch, at times.\nHe also encourages class participation from everyone as much as possible. He caps his classes at around 60 students so that there's an intimate class/lecture environment, and it definitely works. He's pretty good about cutting people off who go too off topic, too.\nThe only thing I felt Shapiro didn't do enough of was detailed textual analysis (eg syntax, diction, etc.) but the rest of the class more than made up for this and I really didn't think that much of it. He's an incredible professor and I would honestly recommend his class to just about anyone. \nHe comes off a bit intimidating the first class but as has been said before he is really wonderful and caring of his students. He is really helpful during office hours and encourages all his students to go to talk about the final paper. I was pretty intimidated during office hours but did feel like I got some good feedback on my paper before handing it in.\nAlso, he's absolutely hilarious.\nWorkload:\n600-word theater review\nmidterm that's all IDs\nfinal paper (the topic is given over a month in advance and he encourages you to go to office hours a lot)\nparticipation\nfinal exam (on the last day of class for us) that was a mix of IDs and two(?) essays on the text\nI found grading to be fair.\n"

The first few classes made me want to shit my pants (he barked so gruffly at the students who arrived late that I was genuinely scared to go to the bathroom mid-lecture), but you will quickly learn that his no-nonsense persona is just part of his teaching act; he is one of the warmest, most generous, most dedicated people I know beneath that spiky shell. His classroom, after all, is a theatre: every lecture begins with audience participation, and he thoughtfully and successfully uses your gut reactions to each reading as a starting point for more serious discussion. He wants you to read Shakespeare as much as you think about how you FEEL when reading a specific play or poem. He also cares immensely about your writing: he will treat everything you write as if you were submitting it to the copy desk at The New Yorker, and he will give you sharp, thorough feedback on your work throughout the writing process (I still get goosebumps when I read his comments on my final essay).\nBasically, you are doing yourself a terrible disservice by not taking this class before you graduate. He is, by far, my favorite teacher, and his lectures made me feel more alive than those of any other professor at Columbia.\nWorkload:\nRead about 1 play/week. Write a short textual analysis, a 600-word theatre review, and a 2100-word essay on Hamlet that will take you the entire semester to write.

And, I've taken classes with pretty much every well-reviewed professor in the English Department. Shapiro has a truly dynamic personality, and he ran our class smoothly and intelligently. Shapiro is not only insightful and engaging, but hilariously funny. He's a true delight.\nYet, these qualities are not what truly set him apart. After all, there are a lot of professors at Columbia who run great seminars. The real cherry on top is the feedback you will receive on your writing. Although most professors only grade and critique your essay's argument, Shapiro cares deeply about your writing style. Every week, we were required to hand in a 600 word paper, which would be promptly returned 7 days later bleeding with red ink. Shapiro's writing philosophy is deceptively simple: don't write anything you wouldn't say. Over the course of the semester, my writing style went from dense and jargony to crisp and gripping. \nShapiro doesn't give your papers letter grades. Instead, he operates on a \u00e2\u0153\u201c/\u00e2\u0153\u201c+/\u00e2\u0153\u201c- system. At the end of the semester, he met with all of us individually, and gave us a grade based on our class and writing performance. Don't freak out if you can't seem to crack a \u00e2\u0153\u201c+. He doesn't grade you cumulatively, but rather based on where you end up (I only got a \u00e2\u0153\u201c+ on the last paper). I've never worked so hard for a class, and never been prouder to receive an A.\nAlso, he got us tickets to see King Lear with Derek Jacobi, which proved to be the best Shakespeare production I've ever seen.\nTake this class, and never look back.\nWorkload:\nModerate to light reading. Sometimes, we'd spend two weeks on the same poem. However, he expects you to pour your heart and soul into a 600-word essay due every class. This is tough, but the spacing of the workload makes it very reasonable. Don't worry too much about grades: he told us that all of us would get somewhere B+ to A range. Another nice bonus in this course is that he gives your final grade at the last class.\n"

Sure, I left with a heightened ability to read Shakespeare texts, but I have a feeling this has more to do with the sheer number of texts we had to read than with Shapiro's lectures.\nYes, Shapiro keeps you awake at 9 AM, there's lots of fun acting, etc. etc. but the class itself isn't particularly intellectual. This is frustrating, because, as your in-depth and amusingly harsh paper comments will illuminate, Shapiro's a really smart guy. His lectures though, with the exception of a couple, seem dumbed down and didn't inspire me in the way that a lot of other professors in the English department have. Often, the class was left sitting in silence while Shapiro asked inane, obvious questions that no one wanted to answer.\nAssignments (the final paper and final exam) are pretty interesting and get you thinking, but I couldn't help wishing, while I took the final, that Shapiro had toned down the entertainment and his personality in order to teach the answers to these sorts of stimulating questions.\nIf you're not put off by this class's lack of content, by all means take it. But I'd carefully consider your choice, especially if you have options to take a class with Jenny Davidson or Erik Gray.\nWorkload:\nOne paper assignment (which we're apparently supposed to spend weeks working on), a midterm (IDs) and a final (essays, pretty challenging).\n"

These are not boring lectures - Shapiro lopes around the room cold-calling, staging scenes, and asking intimate questions about bodily functions. He isn't quite a close-reading kind of guy, although he does get into the nuances of language. But really, it's a comprehensive, big-ideas class. Because Shapiro's interested in Shakespeare's process and the circumstances of the Elizabethan literary scene (yes), this class is as much history as it is literature. It's sort of like watching a Ken Burns documentary about Shakespeare instead of taking a class on him, only with a lot of mimed sex that sometimes you have to get up and participate in.

This semester he chatted with Julie Taymor as part of the NYFF and he jets off every summer to consult for The Globe. He teaches Shakespeare not just as texts but as plays that force the reader, director, actor, and audience to answer hard questions and make difficult interpretative decisions (some of which you can't be aware of from reading the text alone). Almost every class he makes a group of students get up and act out certain key scenes to drive the point home (while the rest of the class shouts out just how they would like the soldier to pike the dead baby or smear the father in his child's blood). He has the requisite Shakespeare prof reverence for the material but also emphasizes production history and how each play has been reinterpreted to respond to the times in which it has been performed. Engaging, thought-provoking, entertaining, top-notch class. Bizarre that he isn't a gold nugget already.\nHe really cares about your writing and though there are only 2 assignments - a theater review and a paper on Hamlet - he gives extremely detailed (often punishing) notes and won't let sloppy thinking or writing slide. Also one of the few English professors who isn't cripplingly socially awkward outside of class, so go to his office hours - he expects it, especially for the paper.\nWorkload:\na play a week, theater review, 1 essay (he gives you the topic 2 months in advance and expects you to spend that much time working on it), \"regurgitative\" midterm, \"synthetic\" final \n"

It IS a pain in the ass that the class is at 9am, totally brutal (and chances are you'll be on the 7th floor of Hamilton because, as he told my class, he specifically requests that room so that students will have to walk all the way up there and it \"gets your blood pumping\"), but I really think it's worth it. I also really suggest that you go to his office hours, especially to talk about your final paper, because then you get a chance to see his softer side\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe transforms from the intimidating famous Shakespeare expert to a chill guy who wants to help you get a good grade in his class (which, by the way, is totally doable if you do most of the reading). Believe the hype and take this class!\nWorkload:\nA midterm that should be easy if you've been keeping track of the quotes he highlights in class (since a lot of the midterm is IDs, all of which he will have discussed).

Which do you like better, he asked? There are many interpretations of Shakespeare's plays and Shapiro shows us that there are no easy answers. He is one of the most passionate professors I have encountered--his stories about being inspired by London theater make this clear (if you haven't already been convinced by the enthusiasm he shows during class.) Yes, he asks questions and calls on students at random, which is intimidating in a 70 person lecture, but he is just trying to prove to us that we can't just sit and mindlessly absorb Shakespeare--it takes work. And he is one of the few professors I've encountered who actually seems to want to teach and is willing to work himself. He wouldn't even give us contact info for the TAs because he said there's no reason to meet with them when we can meet with him. He personally grades all of the Hamlet papers with comments throughout (on both material and writing style), and an additional page of comments at the end. He even stayed after the final to individually read everyone his comments (his handwriting is atrocious).  For a well-renowned, full professor, this kind of attention is, unfortunately, pretty rare. The material is fairly introductory, but it doesn't matter. The paper is an unbelievably challenging assignment and you'll feel a real sense of accomplishment when you finish it. And Shapiro is, of course, so entertaining that you might just forget to drink your coffee.  If you are a junior or senior English major, take this course. \nWorkload:\neasy ID midterm that doesn't really count, 600-word theater review that doesn't really count (it gets you out to a production, which is Shapiro's ultimate intent...and he gives plenty of inside info about upcoming productions), a 3-essay final that also doesn't really count, and a 2100 word term paper on Hamlet.\n"

Typically, a Shapiro lecture confirms and nuances your own gut reaction to a play (indeed that's what he solicits in class), putting some of the themes that you have identified in historical and biographical context. His overarching argument is that Shakespeare's take on these themes is more ambivalent than subsequent commentators liked to think. This is a good thing to keep in mind, and after a few lectures you should get the hang of it and start looking at Shakespeare's language with vigilance. Having seen a Shakespeare play realized on stage, I understand how different (and better, in my opinion) that is than reading. So I don't think his acting is a waste of time.\nOverall, even though this class may not blow you away with brilliance, this is a good introduction to Shakespeare and more than sufficient for most casual reader's purposes.\nI enjoy Shapiro's dynamicism, but most heartening is his passion for the material and for teaching. He loves Shakespeare and theater, and he wants us to love it too. That as a full professor he teaches two undergraduate courses per semester shows his devotion to undergraduates. If he seems \"abrasive\" in class,  that is his way of keeping us alert. If you talk to him during his office hours, you realize he is the kindest professor imaginable. I have a lot of respect of him as a person and as a teacher.\nWorkload:\nModerate. Shakespeare's language may take some time to get used to, but take good notes and revisit the plays after class.

His approach emphasizes discussion, and while this may minimize unnecessary note-taking and boring lectures, it isn't always particularly educational.

Shapiro's not much on close reading, but he makes you appreciate the plays and understand them on a larger scale. He's also got a great sense of humor, and he keeps things moving. Even though it was at 9:00, I didn't fall asleep once, something that can't be said for my other classes. \nWorkload:\nA play a week, midterm, final, a 600 word theater review and a 2100 word final paper which counts for most of the grade.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis course was easily the most entertaining English course I've ever taken at Columbia, and it's really all due to Prof. Shapiro.  His flair for showmanship is remarkable, and he presents brilliantly.  It's impossible to sleep through one of his classes, even though this semester's Shakespeare was scheduled for nine in the morning.  This is a fantastic class for people who like to speak their minds, because you'll get the opportunity to say something in this class whether you want to or not.  Heh.\nBeware, though -- Shapiro's a quick draw, verbally speaking.  If you can't back up what you're trying to say, or if you're just trying for brownie points with impressive-sounding crap, it's not going to fly.  Shapiro won't settle for less than your best effort, in class or in papers.  But that's ok, because by the end of the class, that's exactly what you'll want to give him.\nWorkload:\nA midterm, a final, a short theater review (3-4 pgs) and a final paper (8-9 pgs).  Be advised:  The papers are assigned by word count (i.e. 2100 words).  Don't run over.  He'll be able to tell.\n"

            "review_content": "\nShapiro's popularity is, at least partly, well-deserved.  He's enthusiastic, engaging, and smart;  he really loves the plays he teaches.  I enjoyed the plays we read and Shapiro usually presented them in an appealing way.\nOn the other hand, Shapiro's lectures left something to be desired.  While I was never in danger of falling asleep during the 9 am class, I never felt I like I was learning a whole lot either.  Only rarely did we study the plays in depth - often the lectures focused almost entirely on our reactions to the plays and on their historical context.  It's true, Shapiro often seemed a little bored with conventional teaching;  but instead of seeming \"abrasive\" (as he did to a previous reviewer), to me he simply seemed focused on  everything except analyzing the plays themselves.  Often I just wished we could get down to the meat of the plays, the language and themes, instead of having to watch scene after scene being acted out by students in the class and, often, by Shapiro himself, who seemed to greatly prefer acting over teaching.  The class time wasn't used effectively and when the class ended I felt I had learned the most about the plays from reading them on my own;  I had a superficial understanding of how they worked, but the class didn't teach me anything very substantial or enduring.\nWorkload:\nEasy.  A play a week, one paper, easy midterm and take home final.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nI came to this class expecting to be impressed - Shapiro gets consistently high word-of-mouth reviews - but frankly, after the first few weeks, I felt heretical stirrings of annoyance.  No question that he's brilliant; no question that he is, more often than not, funny and engaging.  However, he's also abrasive and discouraging; he seemed bored during the required discussion of our papers during office hours; and he spent more than one class period yelling at us for not appreciating the incomprehensible and frankly weird plays that we were required to read.  I can see his appeal, but I just didn't feel it.\nIn terms of the course content, it's a lot of strange Early Modern stuff - basically, every play we read was kind of like another Shakespeare play but too weird to have survived.  The workload is manageable and the grading more lenient than I expected.  Expect to hear a lot of historicizing of the plays and not to talk very much about the language.  Everything we read \"had its finger on the pulse of the times\" or \"split along the fault lines of _____.\"  If you already love Shapiro, you'll probably love this course - if only for his sock-puppet acting.  However, if you prefer your professors to be a little less abrasive and a little more engaged with their students, look for another class.  \nWorkload:\nOne midterm, entirely IDs that he claims didn't count very much towards the final grade; one 8-10 page paper; one take-home exam\n"
