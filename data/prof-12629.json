Now. \nHer quizzes range from incredibly hard and tricky to deceptively easy week to week and she has a slightly hostile attitude towards questions / everything. The quiz averages are around 1-1.5s and she gets really annoyed if you ask her a question that was not emailed to her beforehand. \nOverall, she isn't very approachable and the quizzes make me feel like complete poop afterwards most of the time. \nWorkload:\nWeekly quizzes / non-mandatory hw. \n"
