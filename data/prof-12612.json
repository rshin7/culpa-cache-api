She is sincerely committed to the goals of music hum, and every student who takes the class with her leaves with a new perspective on music generally, let alone classical music. The textbook is really interesting, with one of the first assignments on syncopation citing \"Lose Yourself\" by Eminem. She ties in music from different genres to solidify conceptual ideas, and really strives to make the class interesting for everyone. \n\nWorkload:\nProfessor Kramer does require that you do the reading, and she tests this by occasional pop quizzes. In addition to this, there are two concert reports, a midterm, a final, and additional homework assignments. \n"
