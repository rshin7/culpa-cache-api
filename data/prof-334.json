            "review_content": "\nWhen taeching, Flynn rarely does practical application problems. He teaches every unit by deriving the relevant equations. While this teaching style may work for some, I found it useless when doing the homework and taking the tests, given that the problems are all practical and rarely theoretical. When studying for the tests, I found that the best strategy was re-doing all of the homework (not graded, which is nice), because the lecture slides were completely irrelevant.\nThe variables he uses have no correlation to modern convention (c is velocity rather than the speed or light) so be prepared to learn a whole different set of variables than the ones you're used to. He probably should have retired about fifteen years ago; he tells cute stories about his granddaughter sometimes, but mostly he puts you to sleep. Only a third of the class regularly shows up. Honestly, there's no need to go to lecture; at least for me, the material was entirely self-taught from doing the homework. \nHonestly, you might be better off taking Gen Chem; there's no real curve (most of the class does fairly well) and I don't feel like I understand Chem any better now than I did in high school.\nWorkload:\n7 or 8 ungraded homeworks, three midterms, one final, some quizzes in your recitation section\n"

            "review_content": "\nFlynn hasn't been reviewed in a whiile, probably because not much changes with him. He does his best to make material interesting and clear, but often fails. It's worth going to the lectures though, because for the few people who show up, he will often hide an extra question that's not included in the posted slides in his lectures that is very similar to an exam question. Either way, it's on the whole unnecessary to go to class because the lectures slides are posted and fairly comprehensive.\nUsing the textbook as a supplement is highly recommended. I found that compounded with the book, on the rare occasion that I studied for this class, the material was very well illuminated.\nYou do need to study to get above a B. The exams are very similar to the practice exams, and knowing how to do them perfectly will pretty much guarantee you a B+. It takes a little extra studying to better than that. The whole class seemed to perform well, so there was almost no curve, but about a third of the class got A's. Keep up with the material weekly and you will likely do very well.\nThe quizzes in the recitation section were somewhat difficult, but that depends on your TA.\nI do regret taking this class just because I don't think Gen Chem would have been at all difficult if you've tested into this class and it would have been much easier to very well compared to the other students taking it. Think carefully of whether taking advantage of people failing chemistry for the first time is worth cutting out a semester of chemistry before you take this class.\nWorkload:\nThree midterms (20%), a final (40%), recitation quizzes (20%), lowest 20% dropped or final counts for half.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAs previous reviews have implied, Professor Flynn is a hit or miss.  If you learn best from lectures, this is probably not the place for you, as you will probably learn most of the material on your own.  In any case, I strongly recommend not attending his lectures.  He uses powerpoint slides that go by much faster than you can really comprehend.  To add to that, the lights are dimmed and his voice is quite droning, so you can imagine what happens next.\nI did not find the recitations particularly useful, but the weekly recitation quiz forced me keep up with the material.  His practice exams were really similar to the actual exams, so make sure you know how to do all those problems, and you should do well.  Personally, I felt that the class simply taught how and when to use the equations on his equation sheet without revealing any real underlying knowledge of chemistry.\nAlso, since the exams are all scantron (multiple-choice), you don't get partial credit.  The curve was not bad, though.  I do not regret taking this class, since it was not a large time commitment and a better option than two semester of gen chem.\nWorkload:\nUncollected problem sets.  Three exams, weekly recitation quizzes, and final.\n"

The grandfather who Dad makes you visit every year even though it's somewhat agreed that nobody really likes him and his bitter attitude. He tells the same war stories over and over, long/winding/dry anecdotes about the good old days, and even though we pretend to like his famous shepherd's pie we all know it tastes like a rotten taco. \nDo not go to class. Really. His lectures are filled with units that chemists don't even use anymore (ergs? really?) and confusingly worked out problems. Watch the attendance drop, halfway through the semester there were literally about 30 people in lecture. Just do the problems. \nThe exams are a bit tricky, but not impossible by any means.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI read on CULPA that this class was an \"emotional roller coaster,\"  and I think that was fairly accurate.  At first, I thought it didn't sound too bad and that I had a pretty good grasp on the material, however I walked out of the first midterm with my dreams of a chemistry major absolutely crushed.  His \"creative questions\" on the exams threw me off, and I hardly had enough time to finish the test. Thankfully he drops your lowest grade, so in the end this midterm didn't hurt me.\nI managed to break the class average on the subsequent midterms and the final, but not without obsessively studying the homework, retaking the practice tests a few times, and a horrible sensation of hopelessness accompanying each test.  This is a difficult and intimidating class, but it is possible to keep up if you are motivated.  The recitations were incredibly helpful in going over the material (although I heard that the TA for the other section was much worse), and if you're interested in physics and/or chemistry, you'll find the material somewhat engaging.  Flynn's lectures were kind of boring (and at 9:10, so they were not well-attended), but he is a really smart guy and knows what he is doing.  I did wind up with a lower grade than I had expected (I was told he curves to a B+, although I scored at least average on everything except the test I dropped and got a B), so I'm not really sure what happened.  \nOverall, this class is tough, but as long as you keep up with the work and don't save all your studying for the night before, you won't totally fail.  \nWorkload:\n3 midterms, 8 recitation quizzes (best 5 of which collectively counted as a midterm), and a final.  Drops your lowest grade.  There is homework for every chapter, and even though  its really just \"suggested,\"  you'd better do it. \n"

            "review_content": "\nGoing to the lecture is not completely useless no matter how bleak it looks.  You will see your class size drop from 100 students to 20 maybe 35 tops though.  His powerpoint lectures are useful only as an outline and sometimes a bit confusing...he does explain the material a tad better in class albeit in a droning manner which makes you fall asleep for this 9 AM class (bring coffee).  During lecture, he sometimes throws in some \"cultural enrichments\" or \"not posted slides\" for which it is good to be present because some do show up on the midterm...but if you absolutely can't handle his teaching style it's not worth it and is better to just skip the class in general.\nThings do get better after you get used to his teaching style. It is helpful to either look at the powerpoints before class and/or read the book, which though not amazing is much more clarifying and will teach you more chemistry.\nHe's a fair grader, however his grading is done mostly using statistics thus even though you have really good grades, if everyone else did well your grade is merely average.  Therefore take all the exams (don't skip one b/c u got good grades on the others) and perhaps you may be lucky enough to do extremely well on a difficult exam.\nTo do very well, I recommend spend maybe 6 hrs per week on the material.  Spend 2-3 hrs learning the material covered in the lectures or book and make sure you can do all the homework problems for the recitation quizzes.  Then when it's time to study for the midterms, you can spend maybe that same amount of time reviewing and redoing all the problems.  Make sure to pay attention to his practice exams especially because many of the exam problems are very similar but harder.\nWorkload:\nungraded bi-monthly homework, 3 midterms weighted equally, one final, and weekly recitation quizzes.\n"

Even with a really strong cup of coffee I would doubtless find myself falling asleep in class.  It was far easier to simply skip lecture and learn the material from the slides/book, although the book was not a great deal better.  He would sometimes tell sweet little stories about his granddaughter, though.\nChemistry 1604 was quite easy, if you've taken AP chem.  It is a nice way to get a chemistry requirement out of the way.  Flynn is reasonable with grades, and the tests are a fairly good indication of how well you understand the material.  Essentially, if you go to class occasionally to hear cute stories, study the notes, and do the problems, you'll be fine in the course.\nWorkload:\nSuggested problems are given for each topic, but none are collected\nThere were 3 midterms, 8 or 9 recitation quizzes, and a final exam.  There are 6 units, of which the top 5 are used for your final grade.  Your best 5 quizzes/each midterm are worth 1 unit, and your final was 2 units.

For the second and third midterm, I attended lectures more often but didn't find them too helpful.  I will say, though, he is about as entertaining as a chemistry lecturer can be and he's smart as hell.  When you're following him, the lectures can be pretty interesting.  I feel like I understand the \"how\" behind the formulation of the equations instead of just the equations.  (like in the equation for frequency of collisions between gas molecules at a section of a wall, all of the numbrs and multiples in the equation make sense as opposed to just the concept).  \nFor the second and third midterm, I did ALL of the homework problems twice.  They help so much.  If you know how to solve all the homework problems, you'll do well on the exams.  Not only are the ideas in the test questions all taken from the homework directly or indirectly, some problems are always reproduced exactly.  There is, however, a frustrating challenge problem on every test.  Despite my prep for the 2nd and 3rd exam, the challenge problem got me both times but I did do a little above average.  I was ready to get a B+, but then I studied even harder for the final again just by doing homework problems, killed the final, and got a straight A.  He gave about 40% A-range grades in Fall 2003, and probably around 25% regular A's.  This curve is SO much more generous than regular G-chem, which I think is about 20% A-range grades.

            "review_content": "\nIG Chem with Professor Flynn will take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride.  You'll be happy at first, because you only need to take one semester of chemistry.  Then you will be terrified because you'll realize that this is chemistry different from anything you've seen before.  If you're brave, you'll stick with it.  You'll be confused, but pretty sure you understand things...well...sort of.  And then, you'll take your first test, which will almost certainly bring out all of that horror and despair deep in your chemistry soul.  Professor Flynn is a great teacher and really loves chemistry.  He just sometimes forgets that we are college freshmen and have not been working in the field for 60+ years.  His tests are HARD, and you will very rarely feel sure of yourself.\nThis class is most definitely not for people who lack a real (AP) Physics background, as a lot of the chem is based in \"basic\" physics concepts that I had never heard of before.  I probably would not recommend it for premeds, because there is very little real chemistry until a week before the final.  \nEither way, it can't be denied that Professor Flynn is a great teacher.  He is one of the funniest (in that slap-your-forehead corny way), nicest professors you will ever have, but his tests will bring you to tears.  All the riding on his \"spaceship Columbia\" challenge questions have left me a bit jetlagged.\nStill, he is a VERY generous grader, and if you stick with him through the first test, it will  probably be worth your while.  \nWorkload:\nHomework for each section of the course (not collected, but you will fail miserably if you don't do it), weekly recitations (probably the most potentially painful experiences of your life), 3 HARD tests (the challenge questions are killer), and a final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nFlynn is a really nice prof. If you have any questions, he is totally open to help you.  In lectures, he tells some interesting jokes, sometimes.  That said, his lectures are pretty boring.  I once counted at a lecture and only about one third to one half of the class was there. Probably a quarter of those in attendance were sleeping.  I dozed off a few times, myself.  The lectures are easy enough to understand, but the lights are out and his voice is a little monotone: a perfect recipe for sleep.  The tests were challenging, but manageable and the curve is pretty generous.  If you read either his lecture notes or the book, you can pretty much learn everything.  It's worth taking because it is only one semester whereas G Chem is 2.\nWorkload:\n3 midterms and 1 final -- lowest grade dropped; 1 homework graded; three others for self practice\n"

But he does teach well though. He includes diagrams and boxes to make it very clear. He always gives hints about the midterms and finals, so that really helps. Overall, good teacher.\nWorkload:\n1 homework to hand in. Other homeworks for self-study. 3 midterms, lowest dropped. 1 final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nFlynn's a great person and great professor, but his class is very hard.  He does his lectures in powerpoint, so you can download them, but there's a big advantage to going to class - a lot of what's on the presentations doesn't make sense unless he's explaining it to you.  \nTop 5 reasons to take his class over normal G-chem:\n5) The class is curved on a B+ average, so around a third of the class gets A-range grades\n4) No chem-write paper.  Ask anyone who took G-chem, it sucks.\n3) For a guy of his stature, Flynn is a really humble guy.  He's basically an expert in his field, but he'll happily take an hour of his time to answer your questions about the material.\n2) There's about 80 people in Intensive, compared to ~225 in each section of G-chem.  You can actually ask a question without feeling like you've just made 200 enemies.\n1) Intensive chem is over in 1 semester; G-chem takes up 2.  And if you got a 5 on the Chem AP, finishing Intensive chem gets you credit for a second semester anyway.\nMy point is: Flynn's a good teacher and his class is worth the extra effort.\nWorkload:\nhomework assignments are used as preparation for the tests - all but the first are ungraded.  A whopping 3 midterms and a final keep you busy, but things are fairly curved.\n"

Granted, all the lectures powerpoint and online, but I actually do think it's worth it to go to class, even though sometimes his lectures are tediously boring.

However, it's an EXCELLENT idea to do the problem sets because test problems are often homework problems or are very similar.\n"

He's generous with the class materials: posts powerpoint lectures on the web, holds a LOT of review sessions before tests (with very smart and helpful TA's, and he even leads one himself), gives detailed solutions to homework problems, AND hands out practice tests with detailed solutions (real tests from the year before). He's willing to stop class to answer questions. I have to say, though, that his lectures go pretty quickly and are hard to follow unless you're really good at math and whatnot. If you read the textbook, go to review sessions, and do the homework and the practice tests, you shouldn't have a problem. \nWorkload:\n4 problem sets (one for each unit): only part of the first one is collected. Recitation exercises are easy and helpful in understanding the material (if you READ the packets). 3 tests and a final, all pretty difficult but graded VERY fairly (also, he regrades them if you have a problem). At the end of the term, your score is calculated in two ways: one with your lowest test (not including final) score dropped, and the other with all three test grades but the final counting less. He takes the score that's better for you.\n"

            "review_content": "\nWhen I signed up for this class I was under the impression that it would be a quick review of AP Chem and then a little bit of new stuff would be introduced. Not so. The class - or at least Professor Flynn - starts right out in the nitty-gritty of it, with some difficult-to-follow math on the first day. The class is further worsened by the fact that it's all on slides; all the math is done ahead of time, and thus goes by far too fast for students to really ask questions or comprehend the material - or even write it down. Basically George ends up reading the slides to you as they go by, which doesn't really help the sparse information they give. It seems he designed the course last year or the year before and just kept the slides around. He is very good at answering questions, but often the information provided on the slides are too sparse for a student to do anything less than interrogate him on the subject. Unfortunately, this is the only one-semester genchem course, so it must be borne by those of us who passed the AP test. Yeah, he got a teaching award, but I wouldn't have given it to him.\nWorkload:\n3 midterms and a final, with optional homework. Do the homework, it doesn't take very long. I found the book far more helpful, though.\n"
