She seemed great in the beginning and towards the end it seemed like she didn't care. You kind of have to teach yourself and read the textbook. The TA was kind of immature, but if you pushed enough he gave you really helpful hints. some problem sets take a  L O N G  time to do, however the TA provides hints/help with them. It was an okay class.\nWorkload:\n1 problem set about every 2 weeks, 2 midterms and a final\n"
