Mr. Hughes is an excellent teacher who presented the material clearly, fairly, and in a fun way.  He challenged students who wanted to take math to a \"higher level\" yet he was able to break the concepts up to the basics for people who needed a little more help and understanding.  \nHe is always available to help you and holds office hours each week as well.  \nHis assignments were fair and his exams were also fair.\nAnyway the point is, I highly recommend Prof. Hughes to anyone and everyone.\n"
