Its inevitable that sometimes the class gets off-topic, but those occasions are rare and once its obvious we've reached a point of no return he swiftly reins the conversation in.\nHonestly, the conversations in this class (little or no lecture given, though he does frequently participate in discussion) remind me why I chose to go to Columbia for a tech/engineering degree vs another school with fewer non-tech requirements. I strongly recommend this professor, despite the fact that he sometimes assigns an couple extra chapters to read (though he became more reasonable by the end of the first semester). Also a very fair grader, he gives very valuable comments and takes student input on how to structure the tests.\nWorkload:\nLots of readings, 2 essays, 1 midterm (write two in-class open-book essays; five choices given), one final (30% multiple choice ID's, 70% two in-class open-book essays with five choices given as well).\n"
