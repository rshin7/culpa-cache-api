            "review_content": "\nThe most impressive aspect of Prof. Rosenzweig\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s instruction is how she can spend two hours delineating the immensity of climate change problems and the near-futility of solutions while carrying a gigantic smile on her face, one that is loathe to fade even when in disagreement with a situation. Nonetheless the class is not all doom and gloom, and covers subject matter\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnamely agriculture\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinadequately addressed throughout Columbia and Barnard colleges. Prof. Rosenzweig is a very intelligent and accomplished adjunct professor, hailing from the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies oddly located above Tom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Restaurant, and is a member of the IPCC (intergovernmental panel on climate change), making her a prime source for information on current international climate change issues. However, I believe this also leaves her schedule pinched when it comes to running class, leading to a slightly frenetic and insecure structure within each session. Lectures basically reviewed the readings, which you must do anyway to complete eight tedious response assignments, and were followed by student discussion, which alternated between interesting and overly simplistic for people already well-versed in environmental\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand particularly agricultural\u00e2\u20ac\u201dissues, which turns out to be a small minority. Overall I recommend the course particularly to non-envi majors because of its unique subject matter and some interesting conclusions, but would like a smoother structure and more directed assignments. My biggest frustration lay in maneuvering between international problems as demonstrated by science and politically and economically viable solutions beyond buying cloth tote bags, but hey, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s academia for you. \nWorkload:\nVariable. Weekly readings and eight reponse papers; lengthy take-home midterm; 15p. (1.5 spaced!) final research paper with short presentation; 1 field trip\n"
