I liked UW much more than almost all of my friends who had other teachers, so I feel like she must have done something right. I found the subject matter of the progressions to be extremely interesting, even if I didn't want to write 7 page papers on them. She is dedicated, and genuinely worked hard on making you a better writer, and would respond to students' emails extremely quickly. It's impossible for a teacher to make this a truly enjoyable class, but Rachel will not make it worse, which is the most you can ask for.\nWorkload:\n4 papers (approx. 5, 6, 7 and 2 pages respectively) which are the same in all sections. A fair amount of nightly homework, but she NEVER checks this, so feel free to do the absolute bare minimum for those assignments. The one annoying thing is she'll have certain drafts due online at midnight, which I hated.\n"
