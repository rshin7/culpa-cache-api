            "review_content": "\nListen, I know that all these reviews basically state, \"yada yada yada, the woman is a delight\". But she absolutely is - and it's worth the reiteration.\nCathy Popkin is considerably more than just a highly qualified academic. Despite the fact that she must have read, heard or considered nearly everything there could possibly be to say on the subject matter, my often half-baked ideas have never been so engaged with by somebody in the teaching profession. Her love for the readings is palpable, and her patience and enthusiasm for discussion verges on superhuman. In all sincerity, the hardest thing about the class is not having enough hands to have one in the air, one in the book, and one taking notes at any given moment. If I could come back as an animal, it would be an orangutan, just so I could take this class again and type with my feet. And yes, I'm keenly aware that the tone of this review has gotten well out of hand. You might well conclude that I'm some kind of sycophantic lunatic... but I regret nothing. If you're even remotely curious about Russian lit, please take one of her classes.\nI've also had a class with the equally lauded Liza Knapp. If you're deciding between the two... take both. It's a horrible choice to have to make. If there was any justice, both of these instructors would have gold nuggets. God bless them. God bless Russian literature.\nWorkload:\nThere's a lot of reading, but it's all literature rather than non-fic, and you'll be surprised at how fast you get. Other than that, the only regular work you'll have to do are postings. And as mentioned in other reviews - the posting prompts are great. Honestly the answers write themselves, and it'll help you engage with the material.\nThe tests are graded fairly. \n"

She didn't give us some of the busywork that other LitHum classes have (quizzes or blog posts), but we still really engaged with the texts.\nShe's funny, engaging, kind, and for sure the best professor I've had so far. She more than deserves the silver nugget on Culpa.\nWorkload:\nA few papers a semester. I worked hard on them, but I got a good grade.\nParticipation in class is not strictly necessary.\nMidterm and final. Midterm was only passage IDs, where she asks for a couple paragraphs for each that analyze the passage in terms of the novel it comes from. Final was the standard final for LitHum, but she asked us to spend less time on the long passage analysis and more time on the passage IDs. Very fair grader.\n"

            "review_content": "\nOh man. To be honest, Cathy Popkin is probably the best professor (and teacher in general) that I have ever had. I honestly don't understand how anyone can have such a detailed understanding of so many different works (especially when she's a Russian lit professor by trade). Her class is amazing, and she succeeds in making you interested in some books which are really, really uninteresting on their own. She has an uncanny ability to encourage discussion, which is actually interesting and relevant--none of the wishy-washy grasping at straws you so often see parodied when people talk about English classes. She makes the course as much about life as it is about literature, and about the ideas from the books which relate to us. Yet it's done subtly and tastefully, like so much of this class. She also will go out of her way to do interesting activities on the weekends, such as having the entire class for dinner at her house. Definitely would recommend. Ice skating 6 for sure.\nWorkload:\nIt is what you make of it. Though there's less work in concrete terms than in other LitHum classes (2-3 papers/ semester, no other assignments), a lot is required of you on each one. I'd imagine it's pretty easy to skate by with a B in this class, but Professor Popkin has high standards for giving out As (though you'll find yourself wanting to put in the work to get one).\n"

She always had a well-prepared organized lecture, which she would deviate from based on comments and questions from the class.  (Speaking of which, it's been my experience that the students in the Slavic Studies department are really impressive.  You can't make culpa reviews of classmates, I guess, but mine were so insightful!)  Every week she posted a discussion question which absolutely stumped me, in the best possible way, making me see patterns in the reading that I could only barely bein to make sense of.  She's not one of those professors who ask questions with one correct answer.  She is completely open to the possibility of a student pointing out something she'd never considered, and it was so great to watch her reanalyze the work in light of a student's remark.  At the same time, she doesn't beat around the bush to call someone out on their bullshit.  If you like Russian literature, take this class!\nWorkload:\nA LOT of reading, often 100 pages for each session, but occasionally skipping a section won't kill you.  Paying attention in class is the most important.  Weekly responses to a discussion question.  A brutal midterm and final, simple identifications but then way more close readings than you could do in the allotted time, although I have a hunch she considers your annotations of the prompts along with your actual essays.  A poorly defined class participation grade (She said you wouldn't be penalized for never saying a thing in class, but it's listed as 10% on the syllabus.  Who knows.)\n"

Her class does more work and she gives only 5-6 kids (out of 25) A-/A grades, but you'll learn more and have more fun than other sections. Our class had outings to museums and her apartment for dinner. She really takes an interest in her students. If you do the reading and put in the work you'll do well. Very macro focus is on broad themes, not a traditional English class you took in high school. Seriously take this prof. \nWorkload:\nStandard LitHum reading (try to do all of it, though you can skim certain assignments), 2 five page papers, midterm final. Final is standard, but her midterm is all passage IDs. She doesn't care about \"who said this\", but wants full bodied answers that relate the quotes (often obvious, including names so you know where they came from) to say something insightful about broad themes of a particular work/the semester as a whole.  \n"

The class is supposed to be a lecture but it really a discussion.  Prof. Popkin is respectful of all students and encourages everyone to speak.  My favorite class thus far at Columbia!  \nWorkload:\nVery light - you write two questions for each assigned reading.  Although it's a Russian lit class, there are only two or three novels over four-hundred pages, and Professor Popkin spaces the readings out well, so the longer assignments are mangeable.  A mid-term and final that allow you to review what you've learned during the semester and which don't require studying if you've gone to class and paid attention .\n"

Professor Popkin asks questions like \"do you guys like Anna?\"   By asking questions that could only produce incredibly subjective answers, no one learns anything.   You will not learn anything about Russia.  Whenever a book contained long passages about Russian politics, history, or religious thought, she would say things like \"don't you just want to skip all over that\" and \"I don't think that's really important.\"  Basically, don't be misled by the \"and Empire;\" Professor Popkin does not encourage you to read the books in their historical context.   You also don't learn much about the authors, how the books were received, where the criticism stands.  It's basically a bad Lit Hum section instead of an upper-level literature course that posits itself as a historical analysis of Russian literature.  The 20th century survey that's taught by Professor Stanton, \"Literary Avant-Garde and Revolution\" is a MUCH better class.     \nWorkload:\nMidterm, final, 2 questions per class (which was actually kind of time consuming; most of us wrote about a page single spaced for each class)  However, this shouldn't be important to you because hopefully, you will not take this class.  \n"

She is passionate and enthusiastic, interested in what the students can contribute to class and runs a discussion based class very well. I highly recommend, she can seriously help shape the experience of 19th century Russian lit.  \nGrading:  Popkin says that she believes in recognizing the amazing from the less than amazing, so don't expect to breeze through even though the assignments are pretty easy.  If you read the texts and engage with them, there is no need to worry about the grade.  \nWorkload:\nShe assigns students to write two developed questions based on the text for every class.

            "review_content": "\nI'm not quite as big a fan of this class as previous reviewers.  Prof. Popkin is very nice and intelligent and knows the novels inside and out.  She is also totally approachable, and in a class of about fifty students she learned every name, which is amazing.  And yes the reading list is great.  But this class is too heavily dependent on the students.  If you're in a boring section, the class will be boring.  If people haven't done the reading, the discussion will stagnate (though this only happened a couple of times toward the end of the semester).  In my class some of the most interesting students didn't speak that much, and some of the least interesting babbled profusely.  I have a low tolerance for students who talk even when they have nothing of interest to say, so this really drove me crazy.  Overall, though, the reading list makes this class worth taking.\nOne very good piece of advice--Popkin's main concern is themes.  The whole midterm consisted in identifying five paragraphs by work, author, and a brief (like one sentence) explanation of where the paragraph fit in the story, and then listing themes from the novel that came up in, were hinted at by, or in any way related to the paragraph--you didn't even have to use full sentences.  The themes are the most important part, and the more good themes you can come up with the better your grade will be.  When reading, and in class notes, make sure to note down every theme you can, then make lists of themes for each novel and use them to study for the tests.  If you have read the books, then studying your theme lists is all you have to do to prepare for the midterm (and get an A--geeze I with someone had told me this).  The final was the same as the midterm with the addition of an essay.  She gave lots of choices for the essay topics, all pretty straight forward, and many allowing lots of room for personal opinions, interpretations, etc.  Themes, themes, themes...you'll thank me.\nWorkload:\nlots of reading (especially after the midterm), midterm, final, 2 discussion questions a week (if you pick up on important themes she will love your questions)\n"

She is definitely the best teacher I've had in Columbia. And about the syllabus -WOW!!! Yes, it's a lot of reading, but reading the last lines of Fathers and Sons or Brothers Karamazov can make you see the world in a very different way, while inviting you into the complex but unique realm of word and metaphor, of color and painting, of PURE PASSION! (You can see how much this course excited me!!!) And as one of the other reviewers comments, the students who took this course with me were quite incredible (of course we got more than one boring and sometimes irrelevent comment -but there's a con to every pro). Also, visit her during her office hours. She is always open to any questions/comments... and I can say that this goes beyond the classroom topics. She's a theacher in both Russian lit and life in itself.
