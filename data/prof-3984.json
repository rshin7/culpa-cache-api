            "review_content": "\nProfessor Edwards is simply a spectacular teacher. As a first-year, I personally struggled with the workload (the majority of the students are either achieving their masters or are upperclassmen), but nonetheless I still looked forward every day to coming to class and hearing what Professor Edwards had to say. His knowledge for the topic of African American and African Parisian studies is exceptional and I find it personally impossible not to be engaged in his class. It is a must-take course for all prospective history majors, art history majors, film studies majors, popular culture majors, and english majors. Just a supremely spectacular class. \nWorkload:\nHeavy (4 hr. / night)\n"

            "review_content": "\nI took this class my freshman spring. I was one of two freshman in the class and was very intimidated at first. Even so, this class is by far one of the best classes I have taken at Barnard or Columbia. Not only is the syllabus engaging but Professor Edwards is a fabulous professor who really cares about his students and is very knowledgable on the subject of Jazz, harlem renaissance and the black diaspora. As an english major I really enjoyed how class time consisted of dissecting some of our readings and really getting into the niddy gritty details of style and meaning. Before this class I simply liked the idea of jazz, after I was completely blown away by the amount of history and social aspects there was connected to the musical development of jazz. In this class we learned not only about the musical forms of the blues and jazz but also the written forms, which was really interesting. Professor Edwards was also very approachable after class and in office hours, and not a hard grader at all especially if you take the time to go to office hours and run your ideas by him. I went in pretty much the day before our final paper was due with a strange idea of a thesis and he helped talk me through it. He was also very helpful via email. \nHonestly, take this class if you are at all interested in the history behind jazz and the harlem renaissance. You wont be sorry after reading such a fabulous syllabus and just hearing Professor Edwards speak on the subject - it is pretty much adorable to watch him get quietly excited about something we analyzed in a poem\nWorkload:\nreadings every weak and a weakly post on courseworks, not hard at all it is kind of a free for all. one take home exam plus a paper and a final research paper. If you do the readings and take notes on what he says about the readings in class the take home is super easy. The essay prompts were engaging and not overwhelming. the final essay was 12 pages. Go to office hours if you want to learn more and run ideas by him - he will appreciate it and will be very helpful to give you clear direction and sources for you to turn to at any time. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI'm not sure what to make of this class. It's definitely different than anything I've taken as an English major.\nCoursework covers a fairly large range of writing for which form and conceptions of form is paramount\u00e2\u20ac\u201dBurroughs, Gertrude Stein, and the Dadaists make up the most \"traditional\" writing that you read\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand as an English major used to analysis that starts from close reading, I was totally confused as to how to approach the seminar. I wasn't alone; most of the class circled awkwardly around making a broad point about form while admitting complete intimidation by the pieces we were working with. Discussion was fairly nonfunctional, but the course was new, and it got a lot better by the end of the semester. I'd only expect it to get better in subsequent semesters as Professor Edwards has clearer idea of how students are approaching the material. \nThe course is also as much a writing workshop as anything else; three short pieces integrating visual form, distinct narrative choices, or \"new-media\" tools, graded on a check-minus, check, check-plus basis were the only assignments besides (heavy) reading, presentation, and a final term paper (though the paper could also be a project of your own design). The goal is something like using actual (or inspired) application of the techniques used by the artists in the course, though Professor Edwards is interested in you exploring your own voice as writer. \nThe course, as a whole, is not one where your hand will be held the way through. Professor Edwards exposes you to material, but he doesn't necessarily pave a way for you through it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand it probably wouldn't work too well with the material you look at. GO TO OFFICE HOURS\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit really helps to talk through your ideas about the material on a one-on-one basis. I'd recommend the course, as long as you're prepared to be frustrated at times.\nArtists: Spading Gray, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Bill T. Jones, Martha Rosler, Shelley Jackson, Alison Bechdel, Langston Hughes, Jonathan Lethem, Walker Evans and James Agee, Kurt Schwitters, Yvonne Rainer, among others, as well as a bunch of criticism that's hugely helpful. \nForgiving grading, but tough to tell how you're doing throughout the semester.\nWorkload:\nHeavy and/or dense reading, sometimes including films and music. Three short creative assignments for which there is a lot of leeway. One five-minute in-class presentation, though most were (or at least seemed) much longer. 12-15 p. final paper. \n"

            "review_content": "\nCLEN W3300 Black Paris\nI strongly recommend this class. Mr. Edwards is the best English professor that I had at Columbia. He's a man of great intelligence, a real expert on the topic of Black diaspora and actually wrote a fantastic book about it. The reading list was amazing, a well-balanced selection of the major works as well as relatively less familiar but totally worthwhile, thought-provoking books. His deep knowledge of African American as well as African European music and the way he presented it over the course alongside the readings made the topic and the discussion all the more interesting. He also has a great sense of humor which kept the class always quite enjoyable. Towards the end of the semester, we fell a little bit behind the schedule, but it wasn't due to laziness or lack of enthusiasm like the case of some other professors; he was just so eager to introduce many interesting materials to the class. He was always thoroughly prepared for each class and also very kind & approachable despite his busy schedule. A fair grader, neither too harsh nor too generous. No bsing, no empty dropping of jargons regarding obvious concepts.         \nWorkload:\nmanageable. one-paragraph weekly reading response posting on coursworks, a take-home midterm fairly straight if you have attended classes and taken good notes, and a final 10-page paper covering at least three different works on the reading list.   \n"
