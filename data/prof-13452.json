            "review_content": "\nDebashree is easily one of my favorite professors from both semesters this year! While there is the occasional silence following one of her more profound questions, overall she leads engaging discussions which give everyone opportunities to make meaningful contributions. She's energetic, understanding, and one of the coolest professors I know. The Core can be boring, so I don't always look forward to Lit Hum, but I do always look forward to class with Debashree!\nWorkload:\n\"Show-and-tell\" presentation: student chooses any topic (some examples include Beyonc\u00e9's \"Lemonade\" and Black Mirror) and discusses it in relation to the reading\nQuiz (1 or 2/semester): Basic questions about the reading or midterm/final practice\n1 discussion post/week: Question or commentary on the reading posted before class\nMidterm/Midterm paper (tentative):Last semester the midterm paper replaced the midterm, this semester the opposite occurred\nFinal/Final paper: Quote ID + 2 essays\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nAmazing professor. Kind, attentive and respectful of student opinions, Debashree did everything to make Lit Hum enjoyable. I really recommend taking her class as she really made me think as a student and go beyond simply memorizing obscure facts about individual works -- really a thought provoking class.\nWorkload:\nVery reasonable: provides students with important passage guidelines. Two papers, in class essays and a final -- the usual Lit Hum work plus the reading of course.\n"
