            "review_content": "\nThis is a review for Rose Gardner rather than for French I, because the content of French I probably requires no explanation. \nIf you're interested in learning French at Columbia, I can't recommend Rose more highly. She was very good-humoured, very supportive of everyone in the class, extremely kind, and created a wonderful class atmosphere. Going to class every morning at 8:50 actually ended up being kind of a pleasure. \nI had a great time in the class, and learned a lot of French. If you're going to take the class with anyone, take it with her. \nWorkload:\nStandard for an intro language course:\n- Weekly work that is submitted online\n- Weekly quizzes\n- 5 \u00c2\u00a8essays\u00c2\u00a8\n- Midterm and final \n"
