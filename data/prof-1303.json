            "review_content": "\nAlla Smyslova is one of the best professors, and likely the best language professor, that I have had at Columbia. Alla Aleksandrovna uses a distinct teaching style: it is highly methodological, students constantly are engaged in small- or large-group discussion, and she provides comprehensive feedback targeted to each individual student. Expect her to quickly see and recognize your strengths and weaknesses. Although this may seem intimidating, it is not. She is always there to help students with problems they have with the Russian language. The class is high-energy and engaging as a result of her enthusiasm.\nThe material of Alla Aleksandrovna\u2019s Third-Year Russian course does follow along with parts of the textbook, but she often goes into greater depth than the textbook and more often than not utilizes her own exercises rather than those in the book. In this sense, the course and its materials are obviously designed by her, while the textbook is simply a supplement. Although you will read a lot and write a lot, in my opinion the greatest strength of the course is the emphasis placed on speaking. Perhaps the quantity of new vocabulary terms will be less than in first- and second-year Russian, but the depth of understanding of the lexical topics covered (including vocabulary and phrase retention) and, especially, the grammar is greater. If you had problems with topics like motion verbs and verb aspects, expect to be able to understand them more clearly through the methodology introduced in this course.\nThe efficacy of Alla Aleksandrovna\u2019s course is dependent on the students too. Students who are motivated and do the assignments (which often include speaking to yourself) will experience great improvement in the language, while those who do not follow her suggestions will not. So, I recommend only taking this course if you genuinely wish to improve your Russian skills and are willing to put in the effort to do so. Under Alla Aleksandrovna\u2019s teaching ideology, a large part of becoming comfortable in a language stems from practice. She refers to this as \u201c\u043c\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u044c\u201d (muscle memory), and therefore treats language like any other sport or musical instrument. Class time is not enough to effectuate this, so plan to practice outside of class if you wish to really improve.\nThe class overall is not easy, and you may be frustrated at times, but it is very rewarding. For me, declensions, motion verbs, and other linguistic characteristics of Russian are no longer something I get confused over. If you put in the effort you can expect positive results.\nWorkload:\nThe workload is moderate to heavy, but largely dependent on you. Often, Alla Aleksandrovna\u2019s assignments (which are always clearly written out part by part) include things like speaking practice, that are easy to skip over. However, if you wish to improve your Russian, doing the entirety of the assignments is a necessity. Per class (3 times per week), expect to work for 1-2 hours outside of class. Each assignment has times written on it, so you won\u2019t face any surprises time-wise. Alla encourages spending the whole recommended time: if the assignment takes less time, use the rest of the 1-2 hours to practice speaking or other things.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis course is absolutely fantastic for anyone who wants to improve their Russian language skills - particularly their speaking ability. Because of the small class size, you have plenty of opportunities to speak, and a lot to speak about. The class includes reading short stories, writing essays, working on the finer grammatical points, speaking frequently about your life and experiences, as well as reading the news in Russian and discussing the headlines. Alla Smyslova is an incredible professor - she is constantly energized and passionate, but she is also very caring and considerate to her students needs and abilities. She has a real methodology for teaching grammar that works really well, particularly for difficult topics like verbs of motion. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve their Russian Language over the summer -- it will be a challenging class, certainly, but it will also be immensely rewarding.\n\nWorkload:\nThe workload is quite heavy - not only do you have class four times a week for four hours each session (with a thirty minute break), but you also have on average 2 hours of homework an evening. Furthermore, you have to come to class ready to participate, with prepared speeches and written homework. While the workload is certainly intense, Professor Smyslova is very understanding and supportive if you need extra help or support with the workload.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAlla Smyslova is one of the greatest professors I have had at Columbia. Coming into the class, my Russian grammar was horrible and I felt as though I was behind everyone in the class. After taking two semesters of her class, I can confidently say that I definitely  communicate with family members much better. I can even write essays in Russian. This is all because Alla really cares about her students and is an expert in her field. She knows that everyone comes into the class at different levels and she tweaks the curriculum in such a way that everyone learns as much as possible. She gives a very reasonable amount of work and keeps her lessons interesting. In addition to assigning interesting readings including works of Chekhov, Alla engages students to share information about their backgrounds and their pursuits at Columbia. At the start of every class, everyone had a chance to talk about their day and anything else they wished to discuss. I really enjoyed this and feel like I got to know a lot of people because of it. \nI encourage any Russian speaker to take this class. As someone who grew up with Russian parents but no formal Russian language education, I really benefitted from this class. Alla is amazing, kind, and will help you go the extra mile to make sure you are learning. \nWorkload:\nVery reasonable, some assignments are repeated because she emphasizes the importance of practicing rules to master them. Few tests, which are more like quizzes, you'll know exactly what is on them and should do well if you do all the homework assignments. Large portion of grade is determined by improvement.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAlla Aleksandrovna Smyslova\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teaching style melds Russian silovik, English nanny, and American nurturer. She has a guru level grasp of both languages; linguistics, grammar, structure, and utilization. This is what I expect from a Columbia University professor. If students graded teachers, she would get a solid A. My expectation for Columbia is to provide me with such professors for each and every course I take and this is why I am willing to pay big bucks for an Ivy League education. \nAs much as I tried, I was not able to be in her sections during my first year of Russian, but I was fortunate to have her grammar lecture each Thursday and they came as welcomed respites from graduate student taught classes. The level of energy and effort she put into the grammar lectures were impressive and her preparation of material (PowerPoint, PDF and other multimedia tools) allowed me to go over the lectures and practice afterwards. The fill in the blank exercise on PowerPoint were particularly helpful. She does not cut corners. I learned more in the weekly lecture than I did during a week of classes. She was rarely ever stumped by a grammar question in either language. She engaged the class.\nTeaching is part art and part science; she has mastered both. It is my expectation that Columbia provides students with teachers like Alla Aleksandrovna, who have already mastered the skills needed to educate others. If you have a C teacher, can you expect a student to get an A?\nIf you are serious about learning Russian, do not mind an excessive workload, and want to be taught by a professional educator, look no further!\n\nWorkload:\nFor the grammar lecture none :-) \nFor the course ... insane!\n"

            "review_content": "\nI took first and second semester Russian I with Alla Aleksandrovna Smyslova, along with the Russian Grammar Lecture required for all first year students of Russian. I can honestly say that I'd be hard pressed to think of a more effective and caring instructor, of any subject. As the year went on, I increasingly considered myself extremely lucky to be in Prof. Smyslova's section of the course, and I think students in some other sections probably wished they were in her section, too (everyone was able to experience her teaching at least once a week, in the grammar lecture). She has a command of both Russian (her native tongue) AND English that made her unusually capable of handling even complex grammatical questions. And - you know when you can tell that an instructor really CARES that her students learn something? I got that feeling from Alla Smyslova. There were a few times during the semester when I had to miss class, and Alla gave me as much time as I needed with her in and out of office hours to make sure I understood the material I had missed. I sometimes went to her office hours with one or two other students, and I could actually see one student in particular growing in confidence over the course of the year because of the commitment she gave to making sure he learned the material - I mean, I can only imagine that the confidence he gained from Alla also helped him in the rest of courses, and that's a pretty awesome effect for one teacher to have. Russian is NOT an easy class, but if you want to learn, Alla will not only make it bearable but fun - you WILL learn Russian, and, most importantly, you'll feel like your teacher actually cares.\nWorkload:\nNo surprise - it's heavy - but you'll definitely learn. About 7 chapter tests, no midterm (who needs a midterm when you're being tested all semester?), a three hour written final, and a less than 10 minute oral final with a partner from class. Up to 2 hours of homework a night (but not more), if you really want to keep up.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI absolutely loved this class! First of all, Alla manages to be both warm, kind, and encouraging, as well as quick, sharp, and no-nonsense. Alla will give you 110% as long as she knows that you're giving her everything you have in return. I never left a class feeling like I wasted my time, on the contrary, I felt like I walked away from class having learned something new every time (which is no easy feat when you have her every day). And trust me, if you're in her class you will learn Russian whether you're ready for it or not. Alla likes as much in-class participation as possible and that means lots of practice for listening to and speaking Russian on a daily basis. She has no problem posing a question to the class and then suddenly pointing to you with a smile and an expectation of the answer in grammatically correct Russian. I'd say about 25%-50% of class time was spent with pure grammatical instruction, going over homework, questions, and the like, with the rest of it being devoted to pairing up and being forced into practicing our spoken Russian, with Alla bustling around, eavesdropping on our conversations and swooping in to offer the correct case or aspect.  As the other reviewers have said she's always extremely prepared when she comes to class, with handouts, charts, pictures, anything to get us engaged and learning. She's also very approachable and willing to meet you whenever you need her for whatever reason. So far I think she's the only non-TA to even teach Russian I and I also think my year might have been her first year doing it,  so if you're wavering definitely go with Alla, you won't be disappointed! (Also I think she was able to make some arrangements to have more than the cap of 15 students in her class last year, so I'm sure if you sit in on a class and talk to her she'd do her best to help you get in.)\nWorkload:\nBe prepared. A previous reviewer said it best: Russian I is like Russian boot camp. I spent at least a good 1-2 hours a night every night working on daily reading, writing, listening, and speaking exercises. Tests are given every 1-2 weeks that you definitely shouldn't blow off studying for. There's a written exam as well as an oral exam at the end of each semester. Russian in general is not going to be an easy A, but like other classes, do your work, show up to class, and you'll do perfectly fine. \n"

She works very hard to have a good class (always finds her own handouts to supplement the textbook, encourages us to interrupt her anytime we're confused, patiently repeats difficult grammar rules as many times as necessary).  She has so much energy and she puts so much effort into teaching, that you want to reciprocate by doing well.  She pushes her students pretty hard, but she is also one of the few professors I've had who actually understands that we have other commitments too.  She will meet with you as many times as you want/need to even when it's not convenient for her and she will notice if you're confused.  She expects you to pay attention in her class, notices if you don't, and encourages you to speak up.\nAs the reviewer below also stated, more outside readings would be useful, but overall this is a really great class.\nWorkload:\nAround 1 and a half hours of homework per class which decreased as finals approached.

The textbook, \"Russian for Russians,\" is pretty boring, but it's the only one out there for heritage speakers. Alla makes up for it by introducing her own handouts and readings. We read a few short stories in class, and my only complaint is that I wish we had had more outside readings, but I understand that people in the class were at different levels with their Russian skills so not everyone could have handled a higher reading load--a great thing would be if the class could be split into two levels.

Professor Smyslova's class took my Russian from understanding a lot but feeling mute to really being able to *speak* the language. She is an expert on helping native English speakers let go of the English syntax and sensibility and delve full-heartedly into Russian. The structure of the class is wonderful, and better than those of First-Year or Second-Year Russian; you have an \"aktivnaya leksika\" which means that instead of numbly memorizing lists of vocab, you read articles with the vocab embedded in them and are then required to summarize them in your own words, use the vocab words in different contexts, and keep bringing them up even as you move on to the next text.  Only in the most extreme cases will she resort to English. If you are taking Third-Year Russian you probably love the language as much as I do, but in case not, beware: you cannot get away with not doing your work or pretending to understand something when you do not.

Some might not think she seems very kind, but that is simply because she keeps her classes structured and well organized. Since the class combines two years of Russian into one, she moves it relatively quickly. Though you probably will not leave a class entertained, you will leave with a plethora of information. Her grading is fair, if not somewhat generous. She will also have you correct every homework assignment, quiz, and test. This not only slightly boosts your grades, but also allows you to learn the material more effectively. Possibly the most important point: She is very willing to meet with students on a one-on-one basis, even outside of her office hours. In fact, if she sees you are having trouble she will require you to meet with her, and will strongly encourage meeting with her often. \n\nWorkload:\nMostly moderate, but it can vary.
