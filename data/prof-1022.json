This is the most invigorating course I've taken at Columbia so far, and Professor Baklhle spurs student interest like a pro.  Every lecture is fast paced and packed with material, so it's not an easy challenge, but is still overall worthwhile.  Professor Bakhle is relentless in delivering the extremely complicated history of the formation of modern India; there's never a dull moment in class.  Be warned, the class is all the way at 120th and Broadway, and you can't afford to come in late, lest you lose important information.  Professor Bakhle is strict as well about cell phone and computer use as well, but you wouldn't want those distractions compared the amazing experience you'll have in class.\nWorkload:\n3 5-8 page papers (30%)\nMidterm Exam with multiple choice and a couple of short essays (20%)\nFinal Exam (30%)\nSection attendance (20%)\n"

Professor Bakhle is a fantastic lecturer with a thorough insight into her subject. Moreover, she did an excellent job of contextualizing an extremely broad overview of South Asian history. While we covered a lot of material, I found that it was generally manageable to grasp what was going on and understand the narrative as it was presented. \nProfessor Bakhle also made a tremendous effort to expand the course beyond Gandhi. We read numerous different opinions, and were presented with a class that put Gandhi in conversation with his contemporaries-- and allowed us to understand him within that context. Given that we had such a short amount of time in class and a large amount of material to cover, we actually read about a remarkable variety of the movements and disagreements that dotted Indian history from pre-colonial and briefly, post-colonial times. \nClass had two TA's. I had Divya, who was great at dissecting and making sometimes dense readings understandable. \n\nWorkload:\nHeavy reading, though some weeks are better than others. 2 7-10 page papers, discussion section. \n"

I don't understand why people think she's a \"bitch on wheels\" as one reviewer said below. She commands the classroom but not in a bitchy way at all. \nThe TA's are very intelligent, approachable, and professional. Mine was Omar Sarwar. He started out somewhat lacking in confidence but a few weeks into the semester he had us engaged and the fifty minutes of discussion section seemed to fly by. He's also hot. Just thought I'd add that! I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the history of South Asia.\nWorkload:\n200 to 300 pages of reading a week, 2 paper assignments, midterm exam, and final exam. Weekly discussion posts on Courseworks. It's a lot of work so only take the class if you know you can handle the workload. It's all worth it in the end.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI think the problem with this class is that Prof. Bakhle packs in a lot, and I mean a lot of information into one course.  Sometimes, I just wanted her to slow down, perhaps engage with the students more and ask our input.  Actually, the course was supposed to run for the full year and I was sorely upset when she changed it last minute and condensed it into one semester.  \nShe knows her stuff and that's the best part of the class.  She may come off intimidating, but she is really nice.  Just don't come to class late or expect to type notes on your laptops.  I came in knowing very little about Indian history, and by the end of the class you will for sure have a very different view on Gandhi himself.  \nOh, there is a lot of reading.  I think it would've made sense to stick with just a few books and follow their development throughout the course, as opposed to a whole bunch that at times felt detached from the course.  However, you can get away without doing all the reading.  \nI was upset about the timing of the papers. One was due in about a week and the last one was due a couple of days before the final:((   The exams are cumulative which can kill you with ID's.  I agree with the previous reviewer about the grades and the TA's. I did fine, but Divya and Merve were not the best in my opinion-trust me on this since I was able to sit in on both discussion sections and ask fellow students their opinions.  I had great TA's until I came to this class, and am still baffled by it.  \nI suggest sitting in for the first 2wks if you are unsure whether or not to take her class.  I enjoyed the information I was learning and her opinions on Gandhi.  \nWorkload:\n3  5-7pg papers.  One midterm/final.  Loads of ID's  Reading: 200-300/wk\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Bakhle is one of the best lecturers I have experienced in my time at Columbia. Unlike other history lecturers, her lecture is clear and fast paced. For the sake of clarity,she provides an outline of the lecture in the first five minutes. Her lectures have the perfect balance of fact, context, and synthesis. People seem to call her out for being arrogant but I think the more appropriate word is confident. Bakhle is undeniably knowledgeable on the topic and does not shy away from developing interesting ideas. I went into the class knowing nothing about India and can know have an intelligent conversation about it. Other reviews have shared anecdotes to prove that she is a bitch-  but this is not the case. She made an effort to learn the names of at least a quarter of the students, which is nice in a big lecture, and bought starbucks for a student she \"yelled at\" the day before. \nI am expecting a grade that is likely going to be less than I would prefer, but thats because of my TA, not Prof. Bakhle.\nFinal verdict- Take this class. Dont think twice. I was skeptical of her, having read scary culpa reviews, and kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. It never did.\nWorkload:\nA ton of reading but  I managed without doing most of it. It is interesting though. Three fairly easy and interesting papers, an easy midterm and a final that is a more challenging version of the midterm\n"

            "review_content": "\nI completely agree with the review below. I would just like to emphasize a couple points about Bakhle's class that are extremely irksome. She assigns (no exaggeration) 200-300 pages of reading every week. Most of this reading is only partially relevant to the class. Most of this reading is incredibly boring. Most of the reading Bakhle assigns in primary sources, or chapters out of a history book. So, most of the relevant information is sparse and far between. I would suggest, if you take the class, to only skim a couple pages of each reading. It certainly won't help you on the tests or papers. \nBakhle acts like she is the god of the universe. If anyone comes to class late she will act like they were late because they were lighting up a crack pipe out front of class. If people who are lost and they push open the door to see what's inside, she will freak out on them. One time she gave a freshman about a five minute lecture about, \" the rudeness inherent in disturbing my class.\" She just has no respect for students. One day a person came to class, because her lectures are pretty good, to sit in. She called him out in the middle of a sentence and said, \"my classroom is not a cafeteria, you need to leave.\" Needless to say, that dude probably felt like crap for the next couple hours, and nobody probably even noticed him before she made a big deal about it. The worst part of her power trip is that she routinely held us 10-15 minutes late every class. \nOne good side of the class is that she is one of the best lecturers I have had at Columbia. I probably only missed one or two lectures because I actually felt like I learned a lot listening to her. She certainly brings energy to the table.\nIt appears that I am going to be a B+/A- in the class, which is about my average at Columbia. But I would say that it is not worth it to take this class unless you are very interested in learning. This class is probably great for overachievers, or those really interested in India. But for the average person just trying to get a good grade, this might be the worst possible class you could take at Columbia. \nWorkload:\n3 papers, somehow not relevant at all to your readings. They are assigned six nights before they are due, which would be more frustrating if the topics weren't so simple. i.e. \"defend Gandhi's position on Caste.\" One ridiculously easy mid-term, because you got options in every section, so if you knew 50% of the information you would get a 100. I suspect that the final will be significantly harder, mostly because the TAs sent out an e-mail saying, \"Needless to say, you will need to study your mid-term review sheets because the final is cumulative.\" \n"

            "review_content": "\nI would like to preface this review by saying that I did pretty well in this class, so the following comments are not motivated by bitterness about an unsatisfactory grade.  That said, avoid Gandhi's India with Professor Bakhle at all costs.  Many of the other reviews have stated that this class has very little to do with Gandhi and is more about the 18th and 19th century in colonial India.  This is accurate.  At one point we were talking about Gandhi in World War II, and Professor Bakhle said something along the lines of \"I don't know anything about the twentieth century.  We can talk about the 18th century and I'll tell you everything there is to know.\"  Then why are you teaching a class called Gandhi's India, where the most relevant years are from around 1914 to 1948?  The course should really be called something like \"Colonial India and the Development of Indian Nationalism\" or something like that.  The structure of the class was scattered, there was no coherence, she flip flopped between seeming to organize the lectures chronologically but also thematically, and she didn't provide readings that helped tie together the material.  Professor Bakhle speaks very fast, only stopping to tell TA's to write random terms and names on the chalkboard (by the time they do this you can't even figure out to what they refer because she gone onto other things miles ahead of what she said before), and you are not allowed to bring laptops. \nShe decided to change out whole reading list after she realized the books on the list were out of print.  However, she changed this way beyond the return dates at Bookculture so most of us had bought about half the books already.  She decided to change the course so that it was based on primary sources--which meant making the TAs track down 18th century manuscripts, of which there are about 8 in the world, and scan these 300-page documents from microfilm to put them on courseworks.  No one is able to print 300 pages from courseworks in a week, and reading 200-year old documents on your computer screen never really works.  Needless to say, the reading was difficult but not because there was a lot of it or it was written in complicated prose, but only because she chose to do this in the most ridiculous way.  Also, because she chose a bunch of random primary sources, and didn't really provide enough context in lectures, the class had no narrative and no coherence.  The midterm and final were not very hard, and she gives you a study guide for the midterm with ID's and essay questions, some of which will be on the test.  She gave us a study guide for the final as well, but it didn't have as much information.  I used wikipedia more than my notes for the midterm and final because the ID's were things she never mentioned in class or said one sentence about, and of course there was no context from readings.  The 6 3-page papers were fine, just annoying that you never knew when they were and you only got a week to do them.\nProfessor Bakhle rules with an iron fist.  She kicks people out of class if they are late, or punishes them in other ways.  She made one kid give an introduction to the next lecture when he was late for class once.  She treats her students and the TA's like they are 5-years-old.  I am not against Professors who are strict about discipline.  I actually think most professors let their students walk all over them too much.  But Professor Bakhle doesn't deserve to do this because she does not teach you enough to warrant her students dealing with being ruled by a tyrant.  It would be one thing if she taught the best class at Columbia and the price you paid for it was no being able to take notes on your laptop, or  go to the bathroom during class, or come to class a few minutes late once or twice.  But her class is far from the best at Columbia.  As a history major, I think it's one of the weakest I've ever taken.  I learned much more about India from Professor Tiersten's Colonial Encounters class and Professor Gluck's World War II seminar where we discussed India for 1 week in each than I did in this whole semester about \"Gandhi's India\".  She constantly complained about how it was impossible to address the entire subject (about 200 years and 1 country) in a semester.  This is BS as most other professors teach much broader subjects in terms of time and geography and do infinitely better than she does.  She told our class to write CULPA reviews and say she's really mean and hard to scare people off so that only serious students would take her class.  If you are a serious student, particularly a history major, avoid this class at all costs because you won't learn anything and there are much better classes you could be taking.  If you are not a serious student and are not interested in history, PLEASE take her class pass/fail just to make her frustrated.\nWorkload:\n6 3-page papers that are assigned a week in advance of their due date, so you can't work on them earlier than when you get the question a week before. Midterm and final, where she gives you long list of possible IDs and, for the midterm, possible essay questions from which she picks 3 and you have to write about 2.  The final essay questions were about the first half of the course.  Weekly readings and section.  Don't go to class late if you are not a glutton for cruel and unusual punishment.  Grading is not easy, but not unreasonable.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nThe main problem with Professor Bakhle is that she has not yet figured out how to structure her class so that the material comes across clearly.  She struggled from the very beginning to find an effective way to teach the class.  First she tried to have students run each class discussion, then slowly did away with that and by the end of the semester, was simply lecturing from her notes for the majority of the class time.  She did somehow get across the main points of each text, I believe, but it was done so in a very convaluted, roundabout, and incomplete manner.  If she had a personal intrest in one aspect of a particular piece, she would focus solely on it and neglect to discuss other major aspects of the work.  Overall, her teaching style is not conducive to a class such as CC.  With such a broad and in-depth study of philosophy, clarity is key and Professor Bakhle rarely accepted this.  To top it off, she refused to give the class any idea about the format or content of the final exam and then proceeded to include challenging quote identifications, key terms that were barely mentioned in class, and broad, complex essay prompts to which the response could not exceed one page. \nTo sum it up: I would keep searching.....\n"

            "review_content": "\nI'm actually surprised to see so many rave reviews of this woman since I find her appalling.  The lectures are not too bad--assuming you have a laptop to types pages of notes or are very fast at writing by hand--but Bakhle herself is not likeable.  Yes, she's smart and knows the subject...but that's her job as a professor.  She keeps you ten minutes after the class ends every class.  She assigns ridiculous amounts of reading that no one can finish.  Not to mention that if you don't actually know the history of the subjects discussed in the readings you're probably going to be lost, since for the most part she assigns the intro chapters of various books; the readings are more about theories than historical accounts.  \nSomeone earlier mentioned she makes the class more complicated than it needs to be, and I completely agree.  She'd be better off assigning a few substantial readings than overloading her students reading that in the end doesn't need to be done.  The two coursepacks (yes, two) you have to buy for the class are a complete waste of money.\nTests:  She assigns a ludicrous number of IDs for each midterm and final (about 120 terms for the final), and then has the audacity to put IDs on the test that were never on the ID sheet.  Also, for the upcoming midterm, she gave a list of 53 IDs to know, then added what she called a \"handful more\" a week later.  She acts like hers is the only class we have midterms/papers for and therefore she can pile on as much work as she wants, and whenever she wants.  And speaking of IDs, I have to point out that many of them are merely mentioned in class, and you have to be quick at hand to write them down.  Usually she mention someone without saying anything salient about them except that they were at such and such conference, and then expect you to write about them on the test.  I wouldn't mind her assigning so many IDs if I didn't have to wikipedia MOST of them when I get the ID sheets, because I cannot find anything about them in the 5 pages of class notes I write every day.\nAside from the the lectures, which are usually interesting, I wouldn't recommend this class.  But decide for yourself whether or not the lectures are worth her self-entitlement and self-importance.  \nWorkload:\nLots of reading, most of which can be skipped; TONS of IDs for the midterm and final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI normally read CULPA; however, after two and a half years of reading, I have never felt so compelled to write a review on a professor as I am after taking Professor Janaki Bakhle\u00c2\u2019s \"Gandhi\u00c2\u2019s India.\"\nLet me preface this review with the acknowledgement that Professor Bakhle is incredibly intelligent and engaging\u00c2\u2014her lectures are ridiculously fast-paced (bring a laptop if you have any sense) and you will undoubtedly learn a hell-of-a-lot of information. She knows everything and you will not fall asleep in her class, if not solely out of fear she\u00c2\u2019ll call you out.  I enjoyed her lectures for the most part.  \nThat said...\nThe class name: now when I took Gandhi\u00c2\u2019s India, I thought Gandhi would play a pretty prominent role in the class.  Not so, my friend.  The first half of the course covered the history of British colonialism\u00c2\u2014not just in India, in Africa as well.  Don\u00c2\u2019t get me wrong, I understand why this history is important, but Bakhle seriously thinks Indian history is so complex that the entire first half of the class cannot even delve into Gandhi until the role of the colonizer is established.  While I agree for the most part, general colonialist theory is not the class I signed up for and, in addition, it definitely does not require eight weeks.\nHer lecture style: Bakhle\u00c2\u2019s lectures are incredibly fast-paced because she finds every minute detail in Indian history so important that she just has to cover it.  This just leads to an inundation of facts which are never actually situated within a theme. She probably thinks she does this with a random platitude she unleashes out of nowhere, but she does not do this sufficiently.  She never slows down to clearly define positions or present anything schematically because Indian history is just too \u00c2\u201ccomplex.\u00c2\u201d  In the end, you\u00c2\u2019re just left with a ton of information with no solid thematic context.\nHer readings: Confusion in lecture is compounded by the readings she assigns. Not only is it a laughable amount that is straight-up unreadable in both length and content, the readings are assigned BEFORE her lecture.  We\u00c2\u2019re not talking a textbook here, people.  This is 100 pages of reading (for one class, not for one week) that is extremely theoretical.  Why am I reading about the \u00c2\u201cdebates\u00c2\u201d on sati before I even know what sati is? However, for Bakhle, no such debate can ever be that clear. Instead, we must read a dense introduction (yes, the TWO huge coursepacks are made up of introductions primarily to author\u00c2\u2019s books) that presents an argument on how colonialism shapes the differing opinions on sati. Because we're reading introductions, there is little evidence, and, instead, we're left with an unproven idea on a topic I have been given no background on. Awesome. \nHer class dictatorship: Now I totally respect the fact that the woman has issues with cell phones and people falling asleep in her class, but her \u00c2\u201cbitch on wheels\u00c2\u201d act gets old fast.  It\u00c2\u2019s one thing to yell at someone for dozing off in class on the first day to set a standard, but it\u00c2\u2019s frustrating to the students who arrive on time and want to take a lecture to have that lecture immediately stop, because Bakhle can't focus with someone in the back row who did not get enough sleep the night before. Professor Bakhle sees it as her duty to embarrass that student. Apparently I guess I don\u00c2\u2019t derive as much satisfaction as previous reviewers at the expense of other students, but this \u00c2\u201ccalling out\u00c2\u201d ended up being a huge waste of time, because students inevitable doze off, but she can't seem to focus or understand why ANYONE wouldn't want to hear her speak.  \nWhich leds me to my biggest complaint about Bakhle: the woman is so self-entitled and self-righteous. It is actually ridiculous. She works with a ton of assumptions about how ignorant Americans are.  For example, once she felt the need to digress for ten minutes to tell us how our study of \u00c2\u201cslavery\u00c2\u201d is wrong in that it states that the Africans \u00c2\u201cleft\u00c2\u201d for the New World. Fortunately, Professor Bakhle was there to enlighten me to the fact that slavery was not a humane practice and that the conditions on slave ships were not ideal. I don't know what this had to do with Gandhi, but Bakhle felt the need to express her dissatisfaction that I now know her opinions on the Iraq War, prescription medicine, education, health care, divestment, etc.\nHer papers: I hope you enjoy writing really frustrating papers that are not hard, but poorly-written (1st assigned essay) or extremely general with no direction (2nd assigned essay). Not only that, but she gives you a week to write a paper on the premise that \u00c2\u201cstudents buy papers and it\u00c2\u2019s an issue.\u00c2\u201d I mean, I feel like I was more tempted to buy a paper with this new rule. It's one thing to give us a week, but one week included Thanksgiving and another week included Yom Kippur. That aside, Bakhle would NEVER adhere to promises she made to the class. She was late on both paper topics and switched the deadline for the paper constantly.  \nHer final: Apparently, studying 123 IDs is not adequate, because the final will have 20 of those terms, but 20 other terms that were not on the ID sheet.  What\u00c2\u2019s the point of passing out a review sheet with a bunch of random names/facts that were never mentioned in class (leaving wikipedia to teach me) only to test the class on minor figures she mentioned in passing on some random day in the semester?  At least don\u00c2\u2019t tell us everything is on the \u00c2\u201cstudy guide\u00c2\u201d\u00c2\u2014just give us a test.  \nI expected this to be my favorite class and it ended up being a pain.  She is a good lecturer but this is not the AMAZING class CULPA makes it out to be.  I actually legit felt duped.  I feel like Bakhle would be an amazing CC teacher because it\u00c2\u2019s a smaller class and she's pretty smart. But there are way better history classes out there. Only take this course if you're incredibly fascinated with India\u00c2\u2019s history and care to deal with all the noted issues above.  \nThis pertains to the first half of Gandhi\u00c2\u2019s India, though. I feel like the second half would be better, because, well, it actually deals with Gandhi, as advertised. \nWorkload:\nMidterm/final, 2 papers, 2 in-class quizzes (she cancelled one), and participation in section.  The class is not nearly as hard as everyone makes it out to seem. \n"

It's way too intensely factual and not interesting or engaging enough.  She's definitely smart though if that's what you're looking for.  She's not really nice at all so don't go to her class if you don't like mean teachers. \nCome to think of it, this was my worst class all semester and I normally really like my classes. \nWorkload:\nThe readings are not doable.  No one did them all. It's impossible and annoying because it's just so much reading.  The tests and papers were just annoying and nothing was made to really test knowledge as much as it was made to just make us spend a lot of time completing.

But she's also totally intimidating (I think she actually wants to maintain a reputation for this) and therefore not easy to approach. Her lectures are well-spoken and informative, but rapid-fast. I'd definitely recommend taking a laptop to her class to type notes because your hand won't be able to keep up with her mouth! I ended up taking about 6 pages of notes each class. The material is usually interesting (except when Bakhle herself admits that it will be boring--although she made Gandhi's \"Autobiography\" out to be worse than it was... she said it would be dry, but I actually found it quite fascinating). She demands a lot from her students--the papers were not easy and there were so many IDs for the final exam. Overall it was a good experience as far as the lecture goes, but I will not be sticking around for the second semester. (Gandhi's India is now a two-semester course.) The TAs as a whole were mostly worthless. The review session before the final was a waste of time because they wouldn't answer pertinent questions--they kept telling us to just go look up the answers for ourselves. They eventually posted some decent lecture notes but occasionally they wrote misinformation. My particular TA, Sheetal Chhabria, was intelligent and responsive but politically biased... and I think my grades on papers suffered because of this. (Supposedly she didn't grade us based on our opinions, but I still felt attacked for having differing political views.) In her favor, however, she definitely devoted a lot of time to helping the students and she always answered emails promptly. I think she genuinely cared about the class and I appreciated her hard work.\nWorkload:\na lot of reading, two papers, midterm, map quiz, final\n"

After three years of taking nearly all lit and philosophy classes, she is the best lecturer I have had, and frankly its not even close (ok, Mark Taylor is pretty close).  I'm not making this up: The first time she ever paused or said \"um\" when she was speaking was probably six weeks into the class.   If I ever become phenomenally wealthy, I may attempt to pay Janaki Bakhle a ridiculous sum of money to just come and lecture to me all the time (about anything she wants).  She is without a doubt the most academically sexy professor at Columbia, but she's not just all bluster and gusto, throwing these \"sexy\" terms around haphazardly.  Its obvious that her lectures (they're works of art, really), are well thought-out, and they fit together perfectly.  Yet she can lecture that way on more or less any topic.  She just thinks faster, more logically, and with a wider scope than you ever thought possible.\nAnd although Bakhle can be a little intimidating, she's actually a very sweet woman who cares about her students.  Its obvious that she really cares about her students, not because she coddles them, although she can be really nice and funny, baking cookies and talking about her kid's Barney cake; but rather because she really challenges them;  I came into this class with a decent philosophy background, so sometimes I would get bored and not really think my comments through as clearly as I should have.  She totally got on my ass about this, and I really appreciated the fact that she cared enough to want me to do better.  After a freshman Lit Hum and philosophy fiasco, Janaki Bakhle made me care about learning and philosophy again, and gave me the confidence that I could actually do both.  \nThey're just aren't enough superlatives to describe Janaki Bakhle: invigorating, brilliant, ball-busting.  People throw around the term goddess all the time here.  As an embodiment of academic power and glory, Bakhle truly deserves the honor.  It is an absolutely traveshamockery that CULPA hasn't made Bakhle a gold-star.  Hell, a gold-star would be insulting to Bakhle because it would imply that there are that many other professors are even in her league.  She deserves her own rating, like, say, platinum, or mother-of-pearl or something.  I think I will probably suffer the indignity of becoming a Life-long Learner wherever she ends up getting tenure.  The MEALAC department is absolutely insane if they don't give it to her, along with the reins to the whole department, like, tomorrow.\n"

She did add a lot of extra readings to the syllabus, but is open to trimming the syllabus as the semester progresses if the reading is just too much.  You will have to talk in her class, but even if you're not very articulate or can't really think of something intelligent to say, just spit something out - she'll turn what you say into something that sounds remarkably insightful and intelligent, so you'll at least appear smart.  She says that she's a tough grader, but I really didn't think so.  Everyone did reasonably well on both papers, the midterm and the final.  Her paper topics were a little odd, though, as they didn't really have much to do with the readings.  For example, for the first paper we were asked to write on the war in Iraq and for the second paper we were asked to write about academic freedom in light of the MEALAC scandal.  I did appreciate the breadth of the topics, though.  One thing you must watch out for is her quirky rule about cell phones.  She is vehemently against them and not only thinks they are disruptive to classrooms, but also that they are a menace to society.  She threatens that she'll ask you to leave if your cell phone rings, but, while a few cell phones did go off during the semester, she never kicked anyone out of class for it.  She did, though, ask someone to leave for falling asleep in class.  Other than her impatience for cell phones, she was really an excellent instructor and I would definitely recommend her!\nWorkload:\nAn incredible amount of reading - more so than most CC classes.

This is true; however, all she asks is that you show up on time to lecture and not fall asleep or have Jay Z's \"Big Pimpin'\" ringtone blast throughout the lecture hall.

Really wonderful class, I'd recommend it to anyone.  \nWorkload:\nTons of reading, but nothing in the course pack is ever discussed and you aren't tested on it either.  The autobiography is important and the different texts are helpful too, especially the Metcalf.  I didn't realize how helpful it was until the end of the semester and I wish I had earlier.  1 map quiz, 2 papers (5-7 pages), an insanely easy midterm and a fair final.  All you really need to do for an A is attend class (which is a pleasure anyway) and learn the key terms, names and dates (which are all given out on sheets) for the tests.\n"

I'm the kid who sits in the back of the class and doesn't say anything and falls asleep. But Prof. Bakhle is REALLY amazing, she keeps you on your toes the entire time, she's really interesting and talks about everything from making babies to indian food to what is wrong with English royalty, and makes even Hegel understandable. You better have something to say in every class cos she picks on people, but it's worth it because I've actually come away from CC this semester knowing more than the names of the authors. It takes a lot for me to like a class with such heavy reading, but Prof. Bakhle did it! She's got a nice heart too, IDs for the midterm were easy peasy lemon squeezy, and the final wasn't cumulative.\nWorkload:\nLike every other CC class, way too much reading, 2 short-ish fun to write papers,  midterm, final, with REALLY kind grading. I know someone who got an A+ for this class.\n"

She has a true passion for her subject, and is always very enthusiastic.  Her lectures are dynamic, and her teaching style great.  Her beauty is merely an added bonus!  The TA's in the class were very helpful, and the progression of the class in terms of chronology is ordered well.  Very interesting class, GREAT professor.  She is very accessible, which makes a big difference as some of hte material may get confusing at times.  OVERALL, GREAT CLASS, and if you take notes, you'll do well.\nWorkload:\nTwo map quizzes (really easy), two papers (5-7 pages), an easy midterm and an ID and short answer based final.  \n"

I've taken classes with her in the MEALAC department, and she was great in a lecture setting, but I was not sure what to expect for CC, both in terms of subject and class size. However, Bakhle knows her stuff, she infuses the class with energy and witty comments, and I loved CC with her (I had a different teacher first semester and hated the course). The additions she made to the syllabus (\"Midnight's Children\", \"Beloved\", Hegel, Fanon, and Tayeb Salih's \"Season of Migration to the North\") were fantastic. Although some students claim to find her overwhelming or intimidating, it's really just that they're wimps. I found her very approachable, and always ready to help. One thing to know: do your reading, she opens every class by volunteering students to answer pointed questions about the readings. \nWorkload:\nSubstantial: HEAVY doses of reading, two 5-7 page papers, midterm and final (not bad, reasonably graded)\n"

She is a compelling and capable speaker (and not so hard to look at, either) and her dynamic stage presence makes it hard to fall asleep in her lectures--that, and the fact that she will immediately notice you and reprimand you for doing so, no matter how large the class. Our class did have the difficulty that she often assumed we understood more of the fundmentals of South Asian history than many of us did (think about an American citizen trying to pick up the story of American history for a classroom of foreigners with the Civil War) but as the semester went on her lectures became more organized and will quite likely be better overall the next time she teaches the course.\nWorkload:\nLots and lots of reading, most of which is interesting enough that it won't be a chore to at least skim it thoroughly. One paper, graded by T.A.'s whose approaches ranged from easy A's for all to failing grades for competent papers, a midterm and a final, both of which were ID-style with the IDs coming off from a pre-distributed study guide. Exams graded fairly leniently; if you use your study guide as the extremely useful tool it is you'll be fine.\n"

It was also a bit disturbing how no one had any idea what their grades were until they got them. Midterms were out of 20 and the Final was out of 50. No one knows about curves, etc. At least it fulfilled the Major Cultures requirement. \nWorkload:\nTons of reading. One paper (6-7 pages), One midterm and one final.
