            "review_content": "\nA great professor for CC, and I was lucky to have him for a term.  He's very knowledgable about a lot of the books, and I especially loved our classes on Hobbes and Locke (he is less knowledgeable about Al Ghazali and the Qur'an).\nHe is full of himself and he knows it, and he tells us the most interesting, sometimes hilarious stories about his life.  My biggest complaint would be that sometimes he would follow a student's point on a tangent for a very long time and it frustrated me that it seemed like we'd gotten nowhere, really.  But generally he was able to keep conversations interesting and focused on the stuff that he prepared.\nThe essays are graded fairly.  He likes for you to be succint and not include lots of fluff.  Every sentence should have a purpose in the essay.  It's great to learn to write like this.  The essay prompts are short, just a couple of sentences each, all based on the texts.  But they are not often straightforward, and for CC essays you really should think through your points before starting to write. They are on the short end (1200-1500 words).\nIf you have him for your professor, I would definitely keep the class!  I certainly had a great CC experience.\nWorkload:\n3 essays 1200-1500 words each, and a pretty straightforward midterm and final.  The exams were all short answer questions, had options, and covered what we discussed in class. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI took Justice with Prof. Johnston in Spring 2014 and absolutely loved the class - Johnston is articulate, well organized, highly engaging, and offered excellent guidance as we navigated challenging readings and political theories. I highly, highly recommend this course to any student but especially ones considering a Political Science major or concentration - Johnston's class is what convinced me of a political science major. The class, especially the readings, are not easy - Johnston expects but does not require that students have some base knowledge of Locke, Hobbes, etc - and uses their theories as a basis for the classes' readings which include Mill, Kant, Nozick, Rawls, Nino, etc. The optional TA sessions, however, were incredibly productive in helping clear up the topic material and the frequently convoluted but engaging writings. My TA, who I HIGHLY recommend, was Rob Goodman, and he offered excellent insight into what the authors were actually saying and what topics it related to. Overall, the class focused on some fascinating and highly controversial themes in our legal system today - the right of international rescue, abortion, female surrogacy, torture, etc. The papers, while graded critically, often focused on these same problems - one absolutely excellent topic discussed whether prostitution, in theory, is ever actually just. If you like engaging with political theory and enjoy a highly articulate, organized and accomplished professor accompanied by helpful TAs, I highly recommend this course! Justice was the best class I've taken so far at Columbia. \nWorkload:\nAbout two 60-80pg readings a week and 1 3-4 page paper every 3 weeks. The TAs varied in quality and difficulty but the papers tended to be graded critically but with a lot of helpful commentary. No midterm. Final paper and in-class final exam (not too challenging if you understood at least 80% of the readings - the final exam included some reasonable multiple choice questions and then about 12 essays where you had more options of essays so could pick the ones that you liked).\n"

For CC, he would definitely be one of the better professors to have considering that he knows his stuff. Especially for Machiavelli and Hobbes, he's written books on those guys. But for other areas like the Qur'an and Al-Gazhali, his knowledge could have been greater.\nBut like what others have said perviously, Johnston is very particular about how he wants his students to write their papers. No fluff, no repeating yourself, and generally no bullshit. Though it is annoying at first, concise and precise writing is a good skill and something students who like to make themselves look smart rather than actually write something smart could pick up anyway. \nWorkload:\nVery manageable. Does not add extra reading to the CC syllabus. 3 essays that should be no longer than 1500 words, regular short (1500-200 word) response papers to daily readings. And a very leniently graded midterm and final.   \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis was a fantastic class. I may still have some years to go at Columbia, but this is, and will definitely remain one of my favorite classes ever taken in college. I was attracted to this class mainly because of the interesting subject matter of the political theory of justice and I was not let down at all. For one thing, the readings were all very relevant and interesting (and for a Political Science class, thoroughly manageable), and were usually tied into the lectures and discussions. Professor Johnston was also a terrific lecturer - he was clear and concise in outlining the relevant material and arguments, bringing in external perspectives from the readings and elsewhere, while also giving us his own opinion, all without ever boring me in a single lecture. I really have to disagree with the negative CULPA reviews about his demeanor and manner of teaching, because he was always capable of engaging us intellectually in ways that never implied that his own opinions were the right ones, or only ones worth holding. He was also pleasant, kind and patient, and occasionally abruptly funny in ways that make you think, \"wait, did he really just say that?\", and also make you not regret coming to class that day. Luke, one of the TAs, was also really great - he was always swift in responding to emails and was generally adept in answering questions. \nI thought on the whole that the syllabus was well-structured, the readings interesting (though doing ALL the reading isn't really necessary), and the lectures were always fruitful. The 3 papers we had to do (4 assigned overall) were all very thought-provoking as well, inviting us to think more deeply about issues we had discussed, and to form our own personal opinions about issues in modern society pertaining to justice. Perhaps my greatest takeaway from this course is having the privilege of being introduced to John Rawls, whose theory of justice as fairness is now one of my favorite philosophical works. The module on domestic distributive justice was also the best one, in my opinion.\nI guess most people thinking about whether to take this course will want to know if it's easy, or if a good grade will come out of it. The answer is that it's sufficiently challenging that in order to get an A a fair bit of hard work will have to be put into it, but it's all worth it in the end. In general though, as long as you pay close attention in the lectures (really important for the final) and keep up somewhat consistently with the readings you'll do fine.\nAs a testament to how great this class was, I will admit that I've never taken a political theory class before, and as a (potential) political science major I've never considered political theory as one of my subfields. This class has completely changed my mind about that, as political theory will definitely be a subfield of my major. \nWorkload:\n3 short papers of 3-4 pages in length, worth 15% each. (only 2 of which need to be done, if you do all 3 the 2 with the highest grades are taken). 1 long final paper of 8-10 pages (30%), plus one final that covers the entire syllabus of the course (35%). \n"

I think that he is one of those professors that you either love or despise -  you have to make up your own mind about him. I started off hating the class and the lectures and especially the arrogant and aloof TA's, who acted as if it was a bother everytime you asked them a question. I was particularly bothered by the fact that Professor Johnston had little patience for any ideas that could not be reconciled with his own, albeit well thought out theories of justice.\nAs the year went along I must confess I grew increasingly fond of him. Despite the imperial demeanour, he is very gentle and accomodating to the concerns of his students. \nHis comments on the papers can be biting, and you can either get annoyed with him, or swallow your pride as I did, and work much harder. He does have great passion for his subject which covers a multitude of flaws, at least in my mind. I will  always be grateful to him for introducing me via his lectures to John Rawls, who has since become my favorite philosopher. Overall, if you take the notes, and attend his lectures you can do well in this class, and leave with a great appreciation for the idea of justice.\nWorkload:\n3 short papers with one optional, and the lowest grade is dropped.

Yes, the workload is small for this class, but the midterm and final are just ridiculous- I think I spent more time on his final exam than I did thinking about which college to attend.  He regurgitates his lectures from notes which he randomly interjects his own theses into.  His awkward mumbling and sparatic southern drawl don't help him out any either.  Just avoid him, he makes even potentially interesting theories on political justice seem like death in an inescapable hour and fifteen mintues.  The sad thing is he has potential to be a great teacher, not just someone published in his precious Norton (which he'll make sure to inform you of.)  Good luck to you   \nWorkload:\n3 short papers, one of which was optional.

            "review_content": "\nFrom the first day of class, I was put off by the fact that Professor Johnston was reading almost word-for-word from lecture notes.  Unfortunately, this continued through almost the entire semester.  Johnston has taught this class many times before, and therefore it is nothing new to him - his lectures suffer as a result.  They come across as very scripted and dull, with several humorous and interesting stretches sprinkled in between.   About papers: if you have a desire to be unique, or to challenge accepted concepts of justice or morality, then BEWARE - you will feel extremely stifled in this class.  Professor Johnston has a cookie-cutter image of what papers should look like, and he does his best to make everyone conform to this (quite dull) image.  He even passes out what I consider to be mediocre papers as examples after which he suggests everyone should model their own papers!  I appreciate that the professors and T.F.'s expect clear, well-constructed arguments, no matter what one is arguing, but the fact that they had such SPECIFIC views of what make \"good papers\" was disappointing for those who like to challenge themselves.  My T.F. marked down my grade because he thought my view was \"wrong,\" in his own words.  I was able to show him and the professor that my argument for what was in their opinion \"wrong\" was in fact quite clear and persuasive, and thereby was able to raise my grade on that paper, but the problem was endemic to most students' grades, from what I saw.  This class is not the worst class at Columbia, but the professor's confusion of \"writing a standard paper\" with \"writing an exceptional paper\" is quite nauseating.  I was able to get a good grade in this class only by suppressing any urge I had to become engaged with the topics and by forcing myself to regurgitate Johnston's own views.  If you think you are the type of person that may get frustrated from being expected to write and think a certain way, then avoid this class.  If you can handle being a cookie-cutter student for one semester (or letting your grade suffer), then take the class - the readings are quite interesting on their own.\nWorkload:\n3 short papers (graded using frustrating standards - see above), 1 long paper, a fairly easy midterm and final - fairly interesting readings (and you do not have to do all the readings to do well on the exams)\n"

I took the class in the Spring of my Sophomore year, so the theoretical readings on justice overlapped nicely with my CC reading. Johnston's lectures were amazingly organized and logical; each class was pretty much structured as a logical argument. If you paid attention in class, while just sitting there you pretty much learned the way to structure an argument and write a proper philosophy paper. The readings were extremely interesting since they dealt with current issues. The papers were on current issues as well, and were challenging yet fun to write, even though they weren't graded as easily as some people liked. If you paid attention in class you easily knew what he wanted in the papers (a logical argument in a similar structure to the way he teaches). The class taught me more about how to write than any Core class I've taken.\nAs for grading, I got B+'s on the papers and then probably aced the surprisingly easy final exam and ended up with an A in the class (and I was a sophomore). I think my transcript says there were 30% A's overall, so don't believe the people who think the class was harshy harshy graded.\nI liked the class so much that if i have the time next semester I'm going to go to the lectures just to sit and hear him teach.

It utilizes some of the same readings as CC, however there is more of a contemporary emphasis on the readings, and considerably more contemporary readings are used.
