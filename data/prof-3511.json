I also didn't like that most of the \"seed texts\" he provided the class were written by Columbia professors-it made the class feel very insular and detached from the real, practical world.  \nthat said, one could do worse.  he clearly cares about his students, and he was good at sparking interesting student discussions that provided fodder for essay topics. \nWorkload:\n4 essays.  light reading.  \n"
