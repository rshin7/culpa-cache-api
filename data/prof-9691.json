            "review_content": "\nNili is a great professor and I really really enjoyed having her for Music Hum. She does her best to make class painless and easy. There was only one concert report, a lot of extra listening that she posts on Courseworks. She uses a different textbook than anyone else, so be prepared for that. While she's not super good at eliciting classroom participation, she's more than willing to be patient and answer questions, and really tries to engage the students. I didn't really do any of the readings, and relied on class notes for the exams. It's a good idea to have a little bit of musical background before taking this class, since she seems to place a lot of emphasis on technical analysis of music (e.g. meter and textures) but I'm sure you could get through it fine without any. \nWorkload:\nOne concert report, one midterm, one final. \n"
