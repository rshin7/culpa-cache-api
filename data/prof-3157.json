If you're good at statistics you should be fine for the first half of the course, the second half gets a bit tricky, both in terms of forcing yourself to come to class and understanding everything in detail.\nAt first he teaches everything straight out of the book but after a few weeks he starts teaching extra material so if you want to do well in the midterm and final you should go to every class and take notes (Hard to do)\nMidterm and final were both open book and pretty fair.  Not too easy, not too difficult.  Average was relatively high but his curve at the end was nice.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem set, easy at first but becomes tedious after the midterm.  Open book midterm + final.\n"

Dehnad must be one of the least engaging professor I've had in Columbia. \nIt's not like he doesn't teach the material;he does. He is also very qualified, and you can tell he understands it thouroughly. But he acts like he is forced to come and teach us every week, and it's a chore he completes with very little good will. \nHowever, he seems to enjoy talking to his powerpoint slides and his excel spreadsheets.\nWorkload:\nOne short problem set every week: very useful to grasp the material.\nOne midterm and one final are both open book. It's easy, but as a consequence the average is incredibly high.\n"
