            "review_content": "\nJustin is a man of many talents. He knows his Organic Chemistry almost as well as he speaks Japanese. He is very stylish, charming, and has wisps of curls like a baby angel. His chilled out attitude and lack of desire to ever take points off makes for a pleasant experience in the class. He is always around in his office if you need help and always willing to answer questions. I highly suggest you take the night lab with him, as this is when he is at his most relaxed state. be sure to snatch him up this coming fall, as less is expected of the students who take the class in the fall since they havent had any orgo yet. \nWorkload:\nstandard orgo lab. unknown report, 3 lab reports, weekly quizzes and prelabs. study for the quizzes! unplug your hotplate and wash hands or lose major points! for the lab reports ask your ta what he/she looks for in particular.\n"
