Ridiculous amounts of reading.  But Hodges was really laid-back and you didn't have to do most of it.  If you must take Grammar and Comp, Hodges is a nice guy, so you may as well take it with him.\nWorkload:\nLots of reading and stupid grammar exercises that you don't have to do.  THE WORST TEXTBOOK EVER!\n"
