We speak only Finnish from day one, which means pronunciation and fluency advances quite quickly. She also isn't heavy on test grades - as long as you show up to class, make an effort and write the short essays that she assigns, you'll do well in this class. Finnish is a really fun class and the small size of the department means that it's a little community - we all do Finnish stuff outside of class together. \nWorkload:\nsome homework for every class but not too heavy, maybe 3 or 4 longer essays per semester. easy midterm, fairly straightforward final.\n"
