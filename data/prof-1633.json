During this course, he made a guest lecture on St. Ignatius and the Jesuits, as he is a minister for the Society of Jesus (Jesuits).  After talking with some of my friends who are also in this class, we decided that he was a remarkable lecturer.  His lecture was concise, interesting, and he even tried following in Somerville's footsteps with a few religious jokes here and there.  He is an extremely articulate and engaging lecturer.  Although I did not have him for a discussion section, I heard that he was a really great section leader, so take him if you can.\n"
