Moody is an incredibly organized professor, and the readings she assigns are never too long or useless. she covers the reading in class and posts her power points on courseworks. i still think its incredibly worthwhile to go to lecture though because she further elaborates on the major themes of the reading, and engages the class in discussion. by the end of both semesters i left feeling like i had a new perspective on what law is and what ethics means to me. \nWorkload:\nlight : both classes are essay based (3 essays), in class midterm for both (no worries, just do the reading and go to most lectures)\n"

Professor Moody-Adams is a wonderful human being and a great teacher. She lectures off of slides that she puts on Courseworks so a lot of people don't go to class, and this is a huge mistake. The slides don't contain everything she wants to say and often times she explains things in ways that the slides do not capture or she discusses something that isn't on them at all.\nThe class covers some of the more classic ethical theories (util., Kant, Aristotle) and then moves on to some other topics (Ethics of Care, Egoism, Meta-ethics). It's a great introduction to some of the major topics in ethics (both new and old), and also a great introduction into philosophical thinking.\nProfessor Moody-Adams is really nice so go to her office hours and ask questions. In general the grading is very fair and the workload pretty light. If you go to the TA's before the papers you will not have a hard time writing them.\nWorkload:\n2 Papers (each 4-6 pages)\n1 Midterm (in class, not too hard but very pressuring time-wise)\n1 Take-home final\n"

            "review_content": "\nMoody-Adams is an ethical boss.  Her understanding of the material and her personal insights into it--especially during the last third of the course--are amazing.  She has done a tremendous amount of thinking--and writing--in philosophical ethics, and always gives well thought out arguments for and against the claims made in each reading.  She has also developed some really compelling views of her own that seem to capture important aspects of what ethical inquiry what is really about.  These views are creative and new, yet draw on what feels to be the actual way in which people think about their moral lives, and the class has the privilege of reading a few excerpts from her work in the last week.  I'm a philosophy major and gained a lot from her class; anyone who puts thought into their interactions with the world has much to learn from MMA.\nI'm really happy I took ethics with her.  That said, her lecture style can be frustrating.  First of all, she uses powerpoint, which in my opinion is always boring.  Her lecture style can be engaging--she certainly does not just read from the slides--but the medium makes the class boring at times and sometimes hurts the logical flow of the class.  Secondly, she is often very tired, and it shows.  She can be a little disorganized and some of her lectures were not so clear as a result.\nOutside of her lecturing--which, to be clear, is sometimes great, often just OK--she is always on point.  She loves when students ask questions (though she never prompts them) and she consistently gives thoughtful and interesting answers.  She's great to talk to outside of class and clearly cares to talk to her students despite how busy she is.\nOh, man, the readings for this course are amazing.  We read the big three of normative ethics--John Stuart Mill, Kant, and Aristotle--and then contemporary philosophers in each of their ethical schools.  We then did a week on feminism and the ethics of care (super interesting), one week on egoism, and three weeks on metaethics (which addresses questions of objectivity in ethics and the nature of ethical inquiry).  It was all great.  There's not to much of it and not too much work either.  It was a really great class.\nWorkload:\nNot so heavy.\nOne 2-3 page paper, one in-class midterm, one 4-6 page paper, and a take-home final.  Readings were also of very reasonable length.\n"

            "review_content": "\nDespite her intelligence, renown here, (Moodygate) credentials, (she was Rawls' grad student and has previously worked in positions of power in several big-name schools) and being highly regarded in her field, she is personable, kind, and more than ready--excited, really--to talk to students. \nIf you communicate with her one-on-one at all she will make you want to be a philosophy major.\nShe taught a section herself this semester, and was constantly referring in class to \"new insights\" that her students had given her. While I was skeptical that a person of such experience could be really impressed/surprised with student contributions, it was nice to discover that she's not as jaded as many. \nThe philosophers discussed were many and varied, and overall she did a good job of providing much of the spectrum of ethical thought. She also likes art, and worked architecture and painting in without losing touch with the goal of the lecture.\nPast reviews are true, she does read off the slides, but also adds her own insights that are invaluable not only educationally but also for writing the papers (and this is coming from someone who had never written a philosophy-style paper before this class, so believe me, I needed whatever she would give me content-wise as well as stylistically). It's not necessary to take notes all the time, which I liked, but anything that's not on the slides (and not a strange tangent) you should probably write down. Boredom in lectures is also real, but she is super quirky (slide typos lol) and I can't emphasize the extent of her intelligence and knowledge enough. Sections are fine, better if you really enjoy philosophical discussions. She has little or nothing to do with actual grading, so TA interaction is super important. \nWorkload:\nNot bad.

            "review_content": "\nMoody-Adams is hands down one of the best professors I've had at Columbia and will probably ever have. Here's why:\n(1) She knows her stuff. \nNever have I encountered a professor who is so well versed in the subject matter that she teaches. In addition to historical context and the multitude of scholarly debates surrounding the texts, she would share little anecdotes about the authors and their backgrounds, which were both entertaining and informative.\n(2) She will make you want to be a philosophy major.\nGranted, I'm not going to change my major but the stimulating, intellectually driven conversations really got me interested in the works and helped me see how they are still relevant today. And she often \"pushed back\" in class discussions, challenging us to think more critically about our interpretations and viewpoints, which really helped me to grow as a scholar and thinker. Even with the authors that I didn't like or agree with, I came away with a thorough understanding of their works, what they were trying to say, and how they relate to the syllabus as a whole.\n(3) She's genuinely an extraordinary person.\nWith all of her credentials and expertise, I was intimidated coming into this course. However, I found her to be a very approachable person. She had an openness about her, never hesitating to say what was on her mind or how things were going outside of class (e.g. her daughter graduating, going out of town, etc.) be it big or small, and she often shared personal anecdotes relating to the texts, sometimes referencing her Lit Hum-teaching partner in crime (her husband).\n(4) Um, it's Moody-Adams. Renegade ex-dean of Columbia College. Need I say more?\nShe was a Marshall Scholar and studied philosophy at Oxford. She got her PhD in philosophy at Harvard. She studied under John Rawls. This woman is brilliant. Take her class!\nQUICK TIPS:\n(1) Use the handouts. They are a godsend. They're especially useful for going back over texts while studying or writing papers, or if you didn't have time to read it before class.\n(2) Make an appointment with her before your paper. For the first paper I met with her and realized that I totally didn't understand what was being asked. I came out with a good grade on the paper thanks to 5 short minutes of clarification.\n(3) TAKE THIS COURSE!!!\n\nWorkload:\nVery well organized course overall.\n(1) 2 to 3 short pop quizzes; evaluated with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153check,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153check-plus\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153check minus;\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u009d considered part of your attendance and participation record, which is 10% of the course grade.\n(2) Paper One: 10%\n(3) Mid-term: 25%\n(4) Paper Two: 25%\n(5) Final: 30%\nReadings are standard, and she splits up a lot of the authors over two days which gives us more time to digest and study them. Minimal additions to the standard syllabus.\n"

Don't expect to be blown away immediately, but as the course rolls on, you will realize that you are learning a huge amount and becoming a better student.\nThe main this about her: she really cares about you. She will write detailed, carefully considered responses to your essays. She always tries to be fair with the amount of time she lets students talk in class and encourages participation. She is honest about what she knows and doesn't know -- she has said in response to questions in class before \"that's a great question. I'll be honest, I think it is this, but I don't know if I am right -- can anyone else comment?\" which I think is incredible! She never pretends to ramble on about something unless she thinks it is important. \nMidterm questions are to be expected. Papers are always well thought out. Office hours are generous.

If you have the chance to take her class (she doesn't teach CC very often), jump at it wholeheartedly.\nIt is impossible for any professor to have mastered all of the texts we read in CC. MMA (as she refers to herself) doesn't try to pretend otherwise. She will let you know which texts she knows by heart (she wrote her thesis on Hume, but is also incredibly knowledgable about Kant, Rousseau, and other Enlightenment thinkers). She will also let you know when she only has a working knowledge of a text. Her lectures on the texts that she claimed to know the least about were still some of the most informative, entertaining, and thought-provoking classes I've ever had. She knows every anecdote about every author, she knows the conventional theories on the content as well as the more controversial historical and modern theories. She also often tells us about what modern philosophers think about these works. Overall, she manages to give you each interpretation of the text, so you really feel like you know the work well.\nDon't get it twisted, though. Her lectures are amazing, but this is no lecture class. I am NOT one to participate in class. I'm not lazy, but I'm pretty shy. However, she will never force you to participate. Rather, she will pique your curiosity, motivate you to read the texts, and inspire you to share your thoughts. I shit you not. I'm your typical overworked, cynical Columbia student, but she has actually made me love the core.\nThe manner in which she guides discussions makes the class much more enjoyable too. My first term professor would routinely tell people they were wrong and that would be the end of the discussion. MMA challenges everyone who speaks and will help them, and the other students, come to a better conclusion on their own. Whenever anyone shares an opinion, she'll say, \"I'm gonna push you to think a little bit further on that.\" It's cliche, but she really helps us become better thinkers. I appreciate that she doesn't let students share unfounded opinions (having clearly not read) without correcting them, but I also appreciate that she allows for a discussion, where people are never afraid to be wrong.\nAs for the workload, it's minimal. It's CC, so you read a ton, but she includes fewer texts per term than the average professor. She also spends two classes, rather than one, talking about several texts. She'll generally give you an overview of the more difficult ones (Hume and Kant) and then give you a weekend to read it with what she said in mind. She's a very fair grader in my opinion. Even when you get an A on a paper, she'll give you tons of constructive comments. Basically, she's an angel. \nAgain, if you have the chance to have her as a professor, jump at it.\nWorkload:\n2 essays (3 to 5 pages) - Second essay weight more\n1 midterm\n1 final\nParticipation - only 10%\n"

            "review_content": "\nI don't find that any of the reviews are doing Professor Moody-Adams justice as I took two classes with her. First off, like [almost] every class, you can get as much or as little as you want out of it- the difference here is that she is by far THE most approachable person you will encounter at Columbia. I actually started the semester as a somewhat numb and unmotivated senior and quickly learned that neither one of her classes were going to be \"cake\" so to speak. I too almost cried after my first paper, but then I made a decision to do work, go to office hours and *actually* learn things that I will remember in 10 years. Let me say that it completely paid off and her classes even impacted my motivation and academic trajectory. To conclude, if you've ever felt neglected and frustrated by professors and need to know what a real educator is like - take advantage of the great opportunity to learn from a scholar of her class and take a course with her- you will be both educated and inspired as she is kind, brilliant, and incredibly generous. After all, isn't that what you came to Columbia for?\nWorkload:\nSeminar: a presentation and a seminar paper. \nPhilosophy of Law: two essays, a midterm, and a take home final (with plenty of time). \n"

            "review_content": "\nI was planning to review Philosophy of Law after Christmas, but the negative reviews have prompted me to defend it earlier. I agree with the former reviewers that it was not a standard philosophy course, however, I think it happened to be so for the following two reasons:\n1.\tThe subject matter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c philosophy of law \u00e2\u20ac\u201c falls under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153applied\u00e2\u20ac\u009d ethics, which is apparently different from philosophy qua philosophy;\n2.\tColumbia doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer pre-law classes, and this definitely could serve as one.\nWith that being said, students who sign up for Philosophy of Law should at least expect for two things: a) the course is not purely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153theoretical\u00e2\u20ac\u009d; b) the course is closely related to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poli sci\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. \nBearing the above assumptions in mind, I think Professor Moody-Adams did a great job in putting this unexpectedly large class together. As the first reviewer commented, Professor Moody-Adams lectured in a very orderly manner, and her Powerpoints were very clear and well-formatted. It was also true that 70 percent of the lectures were on the texts assigned for reading. Nevertheless, as someone new to the field, I did find the lectures helpful for me to better understand the relationship between different theories. If it were true that it is the professor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s task to clarify the course materials and the student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s task to build connections between conceptions and to shed new light on the readings, Professor Moody-Adams completed her task very well.\nYet different people have different teaching philosophies, which explains the situation in the previous review.\nIt was also worth mentioning that the readings for this class were extremely interesting, hence discussing them in class was quite an enjoyable experience. To cater the needs of both \u00e2\u20ac\u0153philosophy students\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153law students\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, the course began with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the nature of law\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (theories) and gradually shifted its focus to more concrete matter. Considering the nature of this course, I think the arrangement was understandable. It might be better, however, if Professor Moody-Adams could adjust the proportion a little bit to cater the needs of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153philosophy students\u00e2\u20ac\u009d more.\nDifferent from the first reviewer, I think the essay topics were highly relevant, and working on them has significantly helped me appreciate the nuances of the texts. Professor Moody-Adams has a very specific idea of how a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good essay\u00e2\u20ac\u009d should look like, and will make sure that you know what it is. Do follow her suggestion and give her what she wants. When in doubt, R.B. Brandt and John Stuart Mill are your friends. \nAs half of the class were seniors, and at least 80 percent of the 74 students wanted to go to law school, competition was not nonexistent. It therefore made sense that not everyone was happy to be there. As a sophomore, I felt intimidated throughout the semester, yet it was exactly this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intimidation\u00e2\u20ac\u009d that motivated me to work harder. When the semester ended, I was surprised of how much I have learned in this class thanks to my intelligent classmates. To me the discussion in class was a valuable part of the course, although the second reviewer doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to think so.\nBesides the classmates, the two teaching assistants, Jonathan Fine and Nick Engel were also essential to the course. Both of them have been exceptionally kind and helpful. It was a pity that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have recitation sessions.\nI think the grading was fair and even quite generous at the end. I did cry after getting back my mid-term and first essay, but felt very happy after receiving my second essay and final grades. There are a few theories that can explain this phenomenon; all of them lead to the conclusion that the grading system is designed to make students \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do better\u00e2\u20ac\u009d at the end. \nTo sum up, I highly recommend Philosophy of Law to those who are interested in philosophy of law, or law, or both. The experience is not always pleasant, but definitely rewarding. You will love this course if you put you heart into it.\n\nWorkload:\n1 mid-term, 2 position papers (one page; single spaced), 2 short papers (4-6 pages; double spaced), and take-home final. Short and interesting readings.\n"

Lectures, however, are a painful waste of time. Professor Moody-Adams merely reiterates a summarized version of the readings, adding almost nothing to them. She is more interested in making students feel smart, even and especially when they are remarkably dim, than in discussing or giving a more nuanced version of the readings. For some reason, she is unable to tell a student that he or she is wrong, even when it is blatantly obvious that she should. Grading is on the harsh side, although feedback is good (both of these, however, are up to the TA). This should undoubtedly be a 2000 level course. If you are interested in philosophy, don't take this course. If you have a superficial interest in law, and not in philosophy, then maybe this course is for you.
