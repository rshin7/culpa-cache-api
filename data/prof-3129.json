            "review_content": "\nKathryn is by far the worst teacher I've had in my entire schooling history.  My kindergarten teachers were better than her.  She apparently lacks direction, organization, purpose, inspiration, integrity, etc. etc. Everyone in the class was constantly confused as to what we were doing, project expectations were never established, and  she rarely gave feedback, when she did give feedback it was artificial and unfelt \nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND avoiding this teacher. She seems to have no teaching experience, and almost everyone in the class had a perpetual WTF look on their faces. WASTE OF MONEY $3000!!!\nWorkload:\ntwo 3 hour classes twice a week. she expects you to go on field trips and come in during weekend monitor hours. so not worth it. youd be better off fingerpainting in your single.\n"
