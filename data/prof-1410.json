He was organized and a good lecturer---not the most charismatic.  In general, he grades by the book and is very anal about that.  You will have do extremely well in the exams in order to get an A-/A/A+ in class.  The textbook is not bad at all and you can just learn straight from the textbook without having to go to class.  \nWorkload:\nA problem set every week(ONLY WORTH 10% of your grade but they take SO LONG TO DO!!!!!- every question has an a, b, c, d.... part to it so if you have 10 assigned problems, it is like 40 to do), 2 midterms and  a final\n"
