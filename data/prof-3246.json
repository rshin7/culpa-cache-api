His review session for the midterm was the reason I got an A+ (ok, Vail was also an easy grader, but Brian's review definitely made it clear what to study and what was expected). Again really nice guy, very respectful of all students.\nWorkload:\nmidterm, final, 3-4 1-2pg reading reaction papers, 1 ~2pg film review.\n"
