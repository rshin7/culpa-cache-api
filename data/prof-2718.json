He never asks you to do what you're not ready for, but if you trust him and follow his directions you'll learn to swim by the end of the semester (apparently the other section this semester did not progress as far).  We played a lot of games to help us be comfortable in the water and learn survival skills.  I appreciated him even more after we had a substitute teacher one day who just had us run drills back and forth.  If you don't know how to swim, then Eric's class is the way to go.\nWorkload:\nEasy.  Show up and have fun.\n"
