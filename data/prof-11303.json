However, the extent to which he lets class discussion take over his lectures can be frustrating. The same things would be said over and over for 20 minutes--time that could be spent actually learning more of the material. He is an easy grader--but the TA grades the major assignments and she was super harsh so watch out! Really interesting material, and varied assignments however. I would recommend the class overall.\nWorkload:\nnot too bad, 4 responses to the reading, a film review, midterm and final paper. all fairly graded (although I though a bit harsh for the final paper)\n"
