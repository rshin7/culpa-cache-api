            "review_content": "\nThis team taught course was a creative disaster of epic proportions. Cathy is an affable but rambling literature professor obsessed with her first person knowledge of Russia and its scholarly cognisenti. She cannot resist to tell you one more story, and she will even as time ticks away and the ten articles read for class go undiscussed. Alex Motyl is cool and aristocratic, lays down great theoretical structures for understanding political and economic change to the post-USSR world, and gives dish about other folks in former Sovietology - he's hilarious and speaks like the cowardly lion. \nTogether they spent 1/3 of each class alternately laying out theory and blabbing, then had students give presentations on the dense, often outdated and heavily Russian focused literature. Since this class is required for Harriman Certificate folks, there were a lot of bright people from all over the world and that made the class worthwhile.\nWorkload:\nTons and tons of reading, most of it overlapping and much of it tightly focused on Russia. The upside is that one really needed read more than a few pages of it to get the gist, and that many folks in class had broader understanding of the historical events than the authors did. One in-class presentation, one response paper and one final paper. Don't expect to get your grade in a timely fashion or to get feedback. These people are busy.\n"
