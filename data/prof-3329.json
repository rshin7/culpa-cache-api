Professor Lerdahl is extremely knowledgeable, providing prompt and useful feedback.  He is very picky, but it loves it when students disagree with him.  He is a great teacher. Don't miss out.\nWorkload:\nThis fall: in-class discussion of students' work and analysis of Bach fugues, composing 2 fughettas, 2 3-part fugues, 1 4-part fugue\n"
