            "review_content": "\nSarah was a great instructor! This class was a lot of work, but I never felt like I had wasted my time. All of our written homework and all of our in-class discussions were meant to help us get the most possible out of the readings, and when it came time to write essays I felt like I was well prepared. Sarah was genuinely interested in her students' experience with the readings and seemed to really enjoy teaching us. She gives plenty of personal feedback on every draft and is always willing to meet with you, in or out of office hours. I was really impressed by the amount of work she put into the class.\nShe gives your draft a projected grade and then explains how you can improve it for the final draft. If you pay attention to her comments, you can pretty reliably raise the preliminary grade by at one third of a letter grade.\nWorkload:\nTough but pretty standard. Four essays ranging from 1200 to 3000 words.  Multiple drafts required for each one. A lot of reading and short response writing at first, but this petered off as the semester went on. Lots of mid-weekend deadlines, which were seriously not fun. \n"
