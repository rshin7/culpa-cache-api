            "review_content": "\nToby is VERY passionate about French language and literature which is awesome but it makes him better suited to teach a more advanced third year class in French as opposed to Elementary or Intermediate French which most students are taking to fulfill a language requirement. I would suggest avoiding him if possible. He is extremely strict, has zero sense of humor which makes the class quite dull and at times tense, and despite a clear love for his subject, he honestly isn't the best teacher. He is not the worst French teacher but with a department full of gems, you can also do much better. He is not the most generous grader, but he does make himself available for office hours. If you must take his class, attend regularly, prepare extremely well, and participate as much as you can (this boosts your grade).\nWorkload:\nusual intermediate language level: 4 tests throughout the semester, 5 essays, a final, a presentation, an oral, a lot of reading and grammar homework.\n"
