It's hard to get a good grade because the classes and homeworks are 90% useless. You really have to be a trooper to pick out that 10%.\nIt's a fundamentally bad idea to have three experts split up an intro level class. They sometimes overlap, sometimes lack cohesiveness,  and just generally don't have enough time in front of a class to get their stuff together.\nWorkload:\nweekly homework, weekly labs, two midterms and a final. lots of time, not a lot of thought. At least your brain doesn't get tired.\n"

He's so willing to help you understand the climate class- I would email him questions and he always responded within an hour, sometimes even within 15 minutes, providing really detailed explanations. He also never makes you feel stupid, which I really appreciated since I'm sure I asked some redundant questions. I don't know what else he's taught, but if he's teaching a class, take it.\nWorkload:\nHard but he provides lots of opportunities for help.\n"
