I could excuse awkwardness alone, seeing that this was his first year teaching, but his inconsistencies extended beyond that. He barely commented on drafts but graded final essays very harshly. In one-on-one meetings, which were mandatory, his comments were vague and generally positive-- nothing like his feedback on the final draft. After at least two students complained, everyone received A's on the last assignment.\nWorkload:\n4 graded essays, 3 ungraded but required drafts for each essay, about one 40 page reading packet per week.\n"
