She was always available in her office and responded quickly to emails. If you have her for froniters consider yourself lucky!!!\nWorkload:\nInstead of giving WIA every week she had them due after each unit (recomendation- go to the help room) and lecture questions counted more than other classes but were pretty simple- in addition there was an in class presentation that was supposed to demonstrate what you've learned in fos but was a bit annoying.\n"
