I have taken quite a few classes in the statistics department and I have never had such a great professor (not just in the stat department, but also at columbia in general).\nHe is so dedicated to teaching the class and each of student individually. He clearly puts so much time into preparing for each lecture, and is also extremely helpful when it comes to answering questions. He is very helpful during his office hours and is also open to making time outside his office hours to meet with students.\nThe statistics department could really use more professors like this one!\nWorkload:\nWeekly homeworks (total of 11) - super helpful and not too difficult\n3 quizzes (2 in-class, 1 take-home) plus extra credit quiz that could add up to 25 points to quiz average\n1 midterm\n1 final\n"
