            "review_content": "\nThis class was great. I'm a French major, and I put it off until my very last semester because the subject was of not particular interest to me, but I enjoyed it a lot.\nFirst things first: Prof. Stalnaker is great. I cannot stress this enough. She clarified the objectives and the themes of the class, as well as her expectations, since the first day of class. I thought that she was very helpful. I was one of the few students whose field of interest was not related to the subject matter (and an undergrad no less) yet I never felt isolated or lost. I think that was because Prof. Stalnaker always addressed our questions and comments, and because she did not limit our analysis by imposing only one angle of study. Quite the contrary, she was open to all our opinions and let us take the class to whatever direction we thought important. I think that made us take an active role in the process.\n I also appreciated how she stimulated our curiosity in very subtle manners - unlike most professors, she never flat out pointed to a student and ordered them to answer a question. She always had the right phrasing that provoked us into discussions. \nI think it's also worth mentioning that most of us read some of these texts before (in CC) but I didn't feel that the class was redundant. In my opinion, this class not only makes up for the many flaws CC unfortunately has, but it goes beyond CC because of the level of analysis (of the texts).\n On another note, Prof. Stalnaker always had a positive attitude in class. She would walk into class smiling and she didn't shy away from interacting with her students. She clearly cared about her students and about teaching the class. And her enthusiasm was contagious. \nAs I said, we were told everything there was to know about the assignments and readings on the first day of class. Prof. Stalnaker grades fairly and, more importantly, she provides each of us with long and detailed feedback. I think this is helpful because, it's not very helpful to get an A- and be told that it was fine and you can do better. It's much more beneficial, to be told HOW you can do better. And Prof. Stalnaker definitely did that well for the papers as well as for the midterm.\nI didn't know much about les Lumi\u00c3\u00a8res before this class - only what I came across in CC and in Major French texts after 1800s. So I learned a lot here. I'm not going to switch specialties or anything, but it was an interesting ride. \nOther than Prof. Stalnaker's excellent teaching method, I think that having a class with undergrads and grad students is great. I benefited a lot from the grad students, and they were very open and sharing.\n\n\nWorkload:\nchronologically: 1 midterm (2 essays, in class), 1st paper (5-7 pgs, choose 1 out of 2 prompts), 2nd paper (same as first), final (2 essays, in class)\n"

            "review_content": "\nShe is such a great professor. She is completely fair and understanding; she often would change the reading assignments or due dates of papers based on the workload of students in the class. She is super nice and had interesting things to say about the readings. The class was discussion based with very minimal lecturing to give us background information. There were no reading quizzes, but she really values class participation. She is a pretty fair grader - not easy but it is possible to do well. I really enjoyed her class.\nWorkload:\nlit hum readings, 2 papers, 1 textual analysis, 1 midterm, 1 final\n"

            "review_content": "\nReview:\nProfessor Stalnaker is one of the quirkiest and learned professors you'll probably get in Lit Hum. First off, she's extremely considerate of the work from other classes her students gets and often moves her paper deadlines in response (in fact, I don't think that we ever ended up handing in a paper on its original due date). Also, she always asks where the class is in the reading and tailors the class on the spot accordingly, which is nice. She really makes the class discussion-based, and only lectures only to provide background or a more scholarly aspect of the text (one you can't just get from classroom analysis). She's really open to student input and participation, but be forewarned, she does not take BS. Not that you'll ever see that side of her. She has a somewhat annoying habit of not calling people out on their BS, and when she doesn't really give much direction for how much she expects in papers, not knowing how good your BS is can be a problem. Or you just not BS, I guess. \nWorkload:\nWorkload:\nOnly the required texts, because as a French Professor who specializes in Enlightenment literature, philosophy, the French Revolution, and theater (she's really big on theatre analysis!), she just loves analyzing the traditional stuff. \nFirst semester was more work-intensive: 2 5-page papers on assigned topics, fair midterm, twice a week Coursework responses (they were discontinued and mostly just reading comprehension). \nSecond semester was nice: 2 3-page textual analysis on texts due two weeks or so after they were discussed in class, 1 6/7-page paper on an assigned topic, fair midterm, and twice a week posting on a question and response on Courseworks.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Stalnaker does, indeed, have the patience of a kindergarten teacher.  She meticulously explains anything you ask, because, alas!, she actually cares whether you fully understand the plot and litarary nuances of the texts.  She makes sure you understand the plot, but she is especially good at teaching you how to do close litarary analysis.  Don't throw away the Explication de Texte handout she'll give you; I had her two years ago and I still refer back to it sometimes.  When you write papers, she really takes the time to pore over what you write and she writes out meticulous suggestions on how to improve your work.  The grading is tough, but she lets you rewrite and improve on your first version for a half grade higher (B+ becomes A-, etc.), which is easy 'cause she tells you exactly what and how you need to fix it.  She is one of the cutest French teachers I've ever had; SO sweet and kind!  Best is that she has a chic style that totally adds to the ambiance of a French class (think a la 40's flapper with below-the-knee tweed skirts, an adorable bowl cut, and I swear, she wore a cloche hat when I had her).  Two thumbs up!  Definitely take her.      \nWorkload:\nA work per week, a midterm, a final, and three 4-5 page papers.  For the papers, FOLLOW THE EXPLICATION DE TEXTE HANDOUT and you'll do better than just fine.  As long as you back up what you say with the texte, she doesn't care if you agree with her.\n"

I'll say up front that my only complaint with her is that she is too loose as to some of the interpretations received by students, and she doesn't bring out/guide a discussion all that well.  Aside from that she does a great job discussing the texts involved.  Also, she is a truly understanding professor who doles out grades on the basis of performance and not for the sake of being harsh.  If you're serious about writing a thesis-based argumentative paper, then you'll get an A/A- with no problem... If you think you can use word-magic and eloquent styles to cover your major BS, then fully expect a C+.  She won't judge you on her whether you conform with her, whether she \"likes you\" or not, or any of the other things that characterize unfair grading.\nI recommend her.\nWorkload:\nTwo papers, a mid-term and a final.  No quizzes.\n"

I would definitly recommend her and would love to take a class with her again when she gets back.\nWorkload:\n2 papers, fairly long and very strict grader but in the end she'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

The fault here lies within the structure of the Intro Lit Courses, which most definitely should be three semesters and not two.  Honestly, Prof. Stalnaker made what could have been an excruciatingly painful semester into a generally interesting in-depth analysis of the pre-1800 hit parade of lit.  She's obviously incredibly intelligent and very enthusiastic, which ought to carry over into her students' attitude, unless you're stuck in the class I had, where only half the people knew what was going on...(but that's another story!)   All that being said, she's a very tough grader and the paper topics are challenging!  I found it difficult to narrow down my discussions and often struggled to get a B+.  I think this has more to do with this really being one of her first classes...I'm sure she'll mellow out next semester.   If you're willing to put in the work, she's a great teacher who goes above and beyond in making time for her students and does a great job with the hand Columbia has dealt her:  hundreds of years of literature in roughly three months....  \nWorkload:\ni'd say it's about a book or a play a week, but she's pretty understanding about the real amount of work people get done...three 3-4 page papers which, while not impossible, are pretty tough, one low-stress midterm and one oh-my-lord final.

If you took a pretty good amount of French in high school and are at the higher levels, the reading (except Montaigne) won't be TOO hard, but a little time consuming. It's a necessary start for any other french classes, tho. As far as Prof. Stalnaker goes, the lack of depth is not her fault, its the curriculum. I constantly felt that I would get more out of it if she would just lecture. The woman is very understanding, compassionate, but dont assume that because she gives you extensions on reading (which she does sometimes) that she is not brilliant. She really loves digging into literature and getting the most obscure but wonderful meanings out of it, and once we moved away from the crappy medeival literature, i really enjoyed all the ideas she brought forth in class. She is always available in her office and very willing to give you all the help you need-- as i felt not so strong in my writing and speaking than my reading, she definitely has the perfect combination of care, encouragement, and help to push you along. ANyone who wants to start the french lit track but is afraid of being behind, she will help immensely. She personally took great interest in my studies at columbia, giving me professors to speak to about studying abroad and doing a french concentration. Besides being adorable and sweet, she really does care about her students doing well. And maybe at first that makes her seem like a high school teacher, but there's nothing more i could have wanted when approaching french in my first year of college.\nWorkload:\nnot heavy, about 2 hours of reading for each class. only hard thing is montaigne (i suggest reading it in english, its in butler reserves for some other class). 3 4-page papers (a fair amt. of work), midterm and final. fair to lenient grader\n"
