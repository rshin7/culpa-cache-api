            "review_content": "\nNassim was one of my favorite teachers.  She is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the material, and her lectures were always very informative. She also allowed a lot of time for class discussion/questions and never seemed fazed when students kept butting in with grandiose comments.  She wants her students to engage in the material, but doesn't expect revolutionary insights into art history.  She is also not interested in forcing people to \"like\" certain pieces of art, but rather wants us to understand why these pieces are important. \nNassim seems to assign more work than most art hum. teachers, but this can work to your advantage because everything is weighted less severely. She is also very willing to help students, and if you exert a decent amount of effort and follow her advice, the grading is very generous.  \nWorkload:\nNightly readings. Quizes. 3 graded papers (3 pages each). 2 ungraded papers (2 pages each). Midterm. Final. Mandatory (but fun) field trips.\n"
