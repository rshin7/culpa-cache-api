She had not read or studied many of the texts before this semester (for many of the later works, she read them as we did!), which meant that the study of the material was not in-depth in any way.  We failed to discuss many of the \"big-picture\" themes of the works.  The discussions were insipid and uninspired.  I was very disappointed.\n\n\nWorkload:\nRelatively light.  It's very easy to fake your way through the classes without doing the reading.  Three papers, one midterm, one final.  Her grading is very subjective.  She doesn't give rubrics ahead of time, though she is willing to discuss your grade/the reasoning behind it with you after.  She will not give A+s and therefore treats As the way most profs would treat A+s.\n\n"
