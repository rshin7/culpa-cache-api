            "review_content": "\nProfessor Vaicaitis is very knowledgable of the subject and gives well structured lectures. Even though he might not be the most energetic lecturer, he is thoughtful of students and answers questions well. In a subject filled with a myriad of useless equations and constants, he makes life simple by focusing on the essentials in the material. Vaicaitis' exams are very fairly graded since he bases his grades on your actual understanding of the central themes of the subject.\nThe lab that accompanies this course is somewhat of a joke since it is a time race rather than an actual in-depth application of the concepts (every group only gets half an hour to complete the lab). In conclusion, I learned quite a bit without the pain and tribulation that accompany other classes in engineering.\nWorkload:\nWeekly homework sets which range from relatively easy to hard. Biweekly lab report done in groups of five students. One midterm and one final, both moderate in difficulty and fairly graded.\n"
