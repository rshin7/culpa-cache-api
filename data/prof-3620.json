She has one student lead the class every week by discussing another students' paper, except nobody ever reads the other person's paper (because..why?) and it ends up being the professor, the person presenting, and the person who wrote the paper chatting for an hour. It's pretty pointless, and you won't learn very much. \nWorkload:\nNot hard, just long and annoying. She asks for a presentation on someone else's paper, which most of the time ends up being awkward. She asks for one 5-Page paper and then a way-too-long annotated bibliography at the end, which ends up being a whole bunch of busy work. \n"
