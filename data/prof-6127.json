He is very personable, the class is well organized with weekly readings from at least 3 different textbooks don't worry it isn't more than a few hours of reading per week. Every week there is also an assignment which is usually related to the previous class. Again very straightforward and he often gives you examples of the exact format he wants you to follow which is quite helpful. \nThere are also two quizzes and a final project. One part of the quiz is literally \"tell me everything you've learned so far\" which can freak out some students but it is really just repeating the outline of the course with details that you remember. \nGreat class to introduce material, sometimes there isn't enough time to cover all the material for the class but if you do the readings you don't miss anything.\n\nWorkload:\nWeekly readings and assignments, with two quizzes and a final project which is a culmination of all the assignments plus some extra\n"
