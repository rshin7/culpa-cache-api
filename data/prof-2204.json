            "review_content": "\nAmanda was one of the two professors that co-taught Fall 2003's intro class, and it was awesome! Granted, Lila Abu-Lughod was the other professor, and it was hard not to compare the two, but they were both extremely well prepared to teach this course from each of their own very different viewpoints. Amanda Swarr specifically was a good lecturer, a little dry at times, but overall a good professor. Well versed in especially transgender studies, an excellent professor to watch out for if this is your field!\nWorkload:\nThe class itself had oodles and oodles of reading - a gigantic coursepack, and then an additional gender/sexuality reader - however, this course is taught every fall and it depends upon the professor how much work will be given but definetely expect a ton of reading (the reading was so interesting and fun to read that you won't be complaining though); take-home final, three main essays (e.g. one being a study in which you go out in NYC and observe gender and how it works in that situation; another being reading a biography and analyzing it)\n"
