Thomas was ok -- he was awol at revew sessions and was difficult to understand at times, but still pretty helpful -- but Matt and Darpan were an awesome duo. Both were super clear, responsive to emails, and great at synthesizing course material in a way that was accessible to us. Darpan especially was a gem -- he took the time to post lots of extra notes and study guides (the one for the final was 17 pages long!) that were really helpful in organizing all the material, especially the second half. I think because he was an undergrad too he understood what we were looking for in the class. Hope these guys TA again; by far some of the best ones I've had in the bio department!\nWorkload:\nLook to my review of the course -- pretty standard for bio courses.\n"
