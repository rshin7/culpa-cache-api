            "review_content": "\nKelly McMasters is an extraordinary person to take a writing workshop with. She is a brilliant writer, and it's a real treat to hear her read, but she never takes up class time discussing her own career. The moment workshop begins, it's all about the students. She gives excellent and extremely honest feedback on all assignments. Kelly is approachable and easy to talk to. I always looked forward to conferences with her. She's organized and efficient, and an excellent moderator of discussion. Don't be late to class or she will embarrass you. Don't slack off or she'll call you out. But if you put in the effort and are diligent about your work, you will benefit enormously from Kelly's guidance. It was a pleasure to work with her, and I believe I had some major breakthroughs in my nonfiction writing, thanks largely to her.\nWorkload:\nWeekly peer reviews. Three pieces for workshop (5-20 pages) with two revisions at the end of the semester. Four short exercises with one revision at the end of the semester. Occasional readings. Attendance and class participation a must.\n"
