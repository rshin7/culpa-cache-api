            "review_content": "\nPutnam's class is in no way a sleeper class or slacker-friendly, but it has absolutely been one of my favorites in the department.\nEvery lecture requires your full attention. I was afraid to miss even one because of how vital her explanations are. Her slides themselves can be a little sparse at times but, personally, I think that's just to make sure people are really listening and not just assuming they can download the slides later and learn from them alone. But Putnam makes up for it in a rich, engaging lecturing style that's very aware of how her lessons (and students' understanding) are progressing. She uses illustrative examples and goes at a really great pace, making sure that you get take-away points from everything she covers and that you remember the big picture of the course. And she holds herself accountable to really admirable standards, wasting no time and no energy. If it's superfluous material, you won't find it in lectures or your reading. Even every video clip she plays is worth your attention and a few quick notes. \nI can't stress enough that for every ounce of energy that Putnam demands you to put in, she gives you back tenfold in a really rich methodology and curriculum. In that respect, the woman is no less than a force of nature. Her lectures and syllabus are meticulously designed. I don't think I've ever seen a more rigorously maintained and organized Courseworks page in my life, or had a teacher more on top of reminding you of what will be on an exam, when things are due, how much they're weighted, and the like. It sounds insignificant, but when you're juggling as much as you're asked to juggle in the class, it's something that you'll quite consciously appreciate. Even though its an undergrad intro lecture, she is, again, almost obsessed with making sure you get stuff out of being engaged with the material and the class. She makes herself and her TAs extremely available and treats the class really seriously, which is really refreshing.\nI came in with the class with a marginal (at best) interest in developmental psychology and now I'm leaving knowing so much and totally convinced that the subject area was worth my time. I have a slightly broken back, too, but it was really worth it. She reminded me how good it feels to walk away from a class feeling revitalized, not defeated by myself and my own slacking and disinterest.\nWorkload:\nThe reading and lecture material is quite a lot. There's a midterm (~30%), a final (~40%), and a bunch of take-home writing assignments (~30%) that are spread out throughout the year, and a few throw away points for regular attendance. Her exams cover a lot of material and you are expected to have a grasp on all of it, but her MC midterm/final questions aren't real brain busters. She doesn't curve those grades (or anything), but the class average is on par with what's expected. And unlike a lot of other classes, the writing assignments are not giveaways to pad your grade. If you're even just a little sloppy, she and her TAs who she's apparently trained in her vigilantic image will be all over it. If you want to get an A on them, you need to demonstrate that you understand the concept inside and out, not just rephrase textbook material. I learned that the hard way on my first few, but actually putting energy into them paid off on exams and in other long-term senses. All of her assignments are really useful and worth your time.\n"

I learnt so much from this class that I don't even know where to start.\nShe can be a little nitpicky, and expects you to put in at least as much effort as she does into preparing for the class, but you really get so much out of it.\nClearly organized, often detailed slides, interesting reading and engaging discussion.\nAs long as you pay attention in class, and skim the readings you will be fine.\nI personally loved this class, and the professor!\nWorkload:\nMidterm and Final Portfolio, Midterm and Final Exam\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis is not the course to take if you want an easy A. Putnam does a good job of showing you the important aspects of each reading (well those she goes over anyway) but then in the exams you are asked super specific (and often weirdly phrased and misleading) questions. She's really kind of over-enthusiastic about the subject. The portfolios you have to hand in twice during the semester are not hard at all...however they do take up some time and are require much more effort than Putnam allots them. I never want to write 10 2-page papers for 10 percent of my grade. Putnam grades the portfolio's generously but she grades the tests harshly and they are basically your grade. The multiple choice don't leave room for error and if you're not willing to sit there and memorize everything and anything then don't go. Also go to lecture because you have \"minute-papers\" after almost every class which add a few points extra credit. You also have in class essays...which aren't graded but its important to not miss more than one. \nWorkload:\nTwo midterms (which consist of mostly multiple choice and a one long short answer). A final (which consists of only multiple choice - and was based mostly on things she hadn't covered in class but were in supplementary reading). Two portfolios (each portfolio consists of 5-6 two-page papers. 2-3 are based on in class writing assignments, and 2-3 are \"response papers\" to articles you've found that relate to class material). \n"

Putnam's lectures are always well-organized and incredibly interesting.  She's very clear about the material, and the TA's were also knowledgeable (one had taken the course previously, which was really helpful).\nWorkload:\nObviously, I really liked this course and it was NOT graded as \"nitpickily\" as previous reviewers bemoan (READ: I got my first-ever A+ at Columbia in this course).  The portfolio?  Total cinch.  You have to find a few relevant psych articles (they tell you what library database to look in), you summarize them, and if you're worried your summaries are sub-par, take them to a TA and they tell you precisely what will get you a good grade and what you are not.  You have to really try to get less than an A on this.\nExams?  Just do the reading.  It's multiple choice, it's straightforward.  If you study, you will get an A.  \nBottom line: take this course!  It's interesting and it's easy.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThe reviews for professor Putnam are outdated, so I figured I'd write one. Putnam is very good at teaching.  It's very clear she takes her job very seriously and does everything in her power to make sure you get everything you possibly can out of the material she presents.  That being said, she expects close to perfection from her students.  Grading is incredibly difficult and nit-picky.  No extra credit is given anymore, so don't rely on that to help your grade.  No one in the class had anything positive to say about the writing portfolio, and I cannot stress this enough.  She expects a portfolio before the midterm and the final.  Both times I printed out my portfolio, it was over 25 pages in length.  Including newspaper articles you had to locate yourself and EXTREMELY detailed two page writing assignments.  Be prepared to write four pages making sure you covered every little detail she asks for and then be forced to cut every possible ounce of creativity out of the thing in order to size it down to the two pages she limits you to. She counts words and lines to make sure you don't go over the limit by a sentence.  Be prepared to get a C on the overall project, and repeat the process again a week before the final is due.  If all of this sounds like something you can handle, take the class.  Aside from the portfolios, the class is a bit irritating but interesting.  If you're a strong writer and don't mind a TON of busy work, the class might be a good fit.    \nWorkload:\nSilly 'minute papers', Midterm Portfolio, Midterm, Final Portfolio, Final.  The midterm and final are all multiple choice, but doable if you've read the book.  Grading of written work is very strict.\n"

Putnam will stop lecture for any question or comment (no matter how stupid) every time.  The readings are extensive but ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.  What she teaches in lecture only makes up about 75% of the questions on the exam.  The rest are pulled from the readings (even if she never brought them up once).  SO READ.  Putnam DOES NOT CURVE so if you're looking for an easy way out of the science requirement, keep looking.  If you work, you will do well and come away with in depth knowledge about developmental psychology.  My main criticism of the course were the two portfolios you had to turn in.  They are graded VERY NITPICKILY (is that a word?) and are way too high school like to be called a college assignment (i.e. Find articles related to class discussion, summarize in your own words, and criticize).  They were both really pointless and time consuming.  But overall, a class I would definitely recommend for those fitting.\nWorkload:\n1 midterm, 1 final (both mostly multiple choice--not too bad if you've attended lecture and done the readings), 2 portfolios, readings.\n"

Unfortunately, she seems to think that developmental psych really means \"make your students feel like they are three years old.\" This can be helpful, as she builds in lots of review into the lectures, or downright horrible. Case in point, the written assignments. Ten pages long, and due the week before the midterm and final, Putnam describes them as \"fun\" and \"good review.\" Worth a measly 20 percent of your grade, and subject to the full extent of her anal retentiveness, they are a huge waste of time and worthless. She actually accused us all of plagiarism on the midterm written assignment and made us all rewrite any passages we thought might be questionable. I am now trying to re-rephrase perfectly acceptable passages to fulfill this useless requirement. Is this a plot to make us all sweat? I just wish they offered this material with a different professor...\nWorkload:\nA considerable amount of reading. Multiple choice exams that are easy if you do the reading. A mind-numbing writing assignment for midterm and final subject to her obssessive rules/requirements.\n"

Too many lectures were devoted to too little, and there seemed to be little connection between topics such as developmental bio and speech and IQ testing.  SO SICK of writing little notecards about any questions we had about the lecture, and the writing portfolio is the BIGGEST waste of time.  The extra credit opportunity is good, and will actually teach you something.  I think that might have been the only benefit I got from this class.  All in all, if you want to learn about how children develop, and are uninterested in the bio aspect of it, take Social and Personality Development with Dweck (who is a much more talented lecturer).  Seriously think about this class before you take it, because if you get annoyed easily by professors who treat you like children (or who dote on their own children and use them as case studies WAAAAY too often) this class will just drive you nuts.\nWorkload:\nWriting Portfolio (5 in/5 out class writing assignments and 3 reaction pieces), midterm, final.

NOTE TO PEOPLE WHO HATE MULTIPLE CHOICE EXAMS: the final is 50% of the grade, the midterm 35%, and they are both almost all, if not all, multiple choice.  Oh yeah, and THERES NO CURVE.

Putnam seems like a nice grandmother-type, but when you approach her on your own outside of class she has little time to talk to you at all.  however there seems to be no shortage of classtime devoted to listening to lengthy tapes of her son babbling as a baby, which honestly has no educational value if you've ever heard a baby before.

Professor Putnam, though knowledgeable, treats the students in her class like elementary school children (except, of course, when it comes to work and grades). 'Take out your crayons or colored pencils' was a common command in her assignments, but luckily the TA's were slightly more lenient. Putnam's organization is also fanatical but a little uneven \u00c2\u2014 expect to have a lot of very, very specific assignments assigned via e-mail at the last minute before discussion sections.
