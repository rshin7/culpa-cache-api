He taught a few things that were helpful the first 4 or 5 classes. After that he started talking about things that were beyond the scope of the class and mostly not understandable because they required more advanced knowledge of mathematics, so the class very quickly became useless. I stopped going nearly completely after that, except at the end of class to turn homework in. The book sucks because it takes a LONG TIME to read and teach yourself, and it's particularly dry, but Boyce and DiPrima taught me way more than Tignor ever did.\nI would say stay away from this man at all costs.\nHe showed up 20 minutes late apparently one day. I left after 15 because that's all students are required to wait for their lame ass professors.\nWorkload:\nRidiculous and random. A weekly problem set that could take between 15 minutes and 4 hours, worth 15%. Two midterms each worth 20%. A final worth 45% that is extremely difficult and mostly unrelated to lectures.\n"

Into class 5 minutes late and out of class 10 minutes late, midterms handed back a month after being taken, 4 page homework assignments due the day of the final, Tignor quite literally does not care a whit about this class. Not to mention his lecturing. You will be lucky to be graced with Tignor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face once or twice during the class as he lectures to himself and the blackboard, back turned to any semblance of adherence to social norms or any relevance to the course material. 45 minutes tangents into linear algebra are the norms, not the exceptions. If it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the generous curve and otherwise obscene alternative ODE courses, Tignor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s class is a stay-away. But believe me, Virdol et. al. are very probably worse. Pick your poison.\nWorkload:\nProblem sets every week (consisting of about 10 problems each, difficulty ranging from appalling to obscene), two midterms (5 problems each, two easy number crunching problems, 1 harder number cruncher, 1 difficult number cruncher, and 1 proof), and one final (double midterm, more proofs and harder in general).\n"

This will come to a screeching halt later on as he goes on tangents about linear algebra and complex analysis and how they can be used to prove things in alternate ways in the class.  In the first month or so of the class, Tignor actually explained how to solve the problems; this made the homework easier.  After that, all of class was spent deriving theoretical results, most of which were not relevant on the homework or on exams.  Maybe one sample problem would be solved every two sections of the class.  \n\nWorkload:\nProblem sets every week.  Most had a sampling of easy problems, a couple of difficult problems, and the last problem in the section.  Two midterm exams (worth 20% each), the first one very reasonable, the second one more challenging.  The final exam was insane and more focused on theory than either of the previous exams in addition to being on more difficult material.   \n"

            "review_content": "\nIf you get off on mathematical formalism, this is the class for you.\nClasses consist entirely of proofs of the relevant formulae and theorems, the application of which you're expected to teach yourself out of the book (the homework assignments build on the lectures rather than repeating them). Tignor is excruciatingly precise in all of the work he does on the board in class -- there is no hand-waving or assertions that things are true; instead he'll define and demonstrate absolutely everything in the greatest detail possible, whether or not the class has the necessary mathematical background.\nAgain, if you like that kind of thing, you'll enjoy going to class. If not, skip the lectures -- it's perfectly possible to get by just doing the homework and reading the chapter carefully.\nEverything people have said below about his strange mannerisms are true -- he would stumble in 10 minutes late every morning, start scribbling on the board without so much as a hello, wring his hands and moan quietly throughout the class and then leave as abruptly as he came. But hey -- this is the math department. Be grateful your professor speaks English.\nI will say that the complaints about his tests are completely unfair. They, like the rest of the class, were proof-heavy, but even the most complicated proofs turned out to be no more than 4 or 5 lines once you had the necessary insight. Naturally, they were all things that we hadn't discussed explicitly in lecture, but if you had a firm conceptual grasp of the material they weren't bad at all.\nFor reference, the midterms all had the same format:\n1 easy proof\n1 hard proof\n1 simple number-crunching problem\n1 complicated number-crunching problem\n1 conceptual question\nThe final was just a double midterm.\nTignor's class was probably tougher than most, but in the end Calc III is the easiest calculus course no matter how you present it -- there's just not that much material. Tignor at least forces you to learn the concepts, and not just the process.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Tignor is by far, without a doubt the worst teacher I have ever had in my 19 years on this planet.  First off he shows up about 10 minutes late every class and keeps you 10 minutes over.  He doesn't stay after to address any questions.  If you ask him a question, it is rare that you get an answer and a correct one at that.  He teaches facing the board so you can't see or hear what he is teaching.  You have absolutely no clue what he is talking about because he speaks in such an indirect manner and talks to himself.  I seriously think he has no interaction with other human beings outside his class.  Read the book as best you can and you might have a shot on his exams.  After personally meeting with him about my midterm #1 (which i got an 8% on and half the class did just as bad) he admitted 2 of the 5 problems were nothing like what he taught or like anything we covered in the book with homeworks.  I have 2 tutors for the class and still barely get by.  I was good at math and loved my life until I took Prof. Tignor's Calc III class. Oh and there is no syllabus to give to your tutors to help you out.\nWorkload:\n10 questions a week...have nothing to do with what he \"teaches\" in class...always from the later numbers in the section\n"

In class he never addresed the class and if anyone asked a question he would say \"ugh, ugh, ugh\" and then go back to writing on the bored.

Unless you are very good at reading texts books and understanding them and want to put hours each week into studing I would not suggest taking this class.   \nWorkload:\naround 20 problems a week...they take around 4 hours to do.

This class requires 2-3 hours of calc studying every day, as stated by the professor himself. He is brilliant; my math major friends find him wonderful, and he knows a lot about proofs, but unless you love calc to death, DONT TAKE TIGNOR. I'm dead serious. Literally, no more than 7 people of a class of about 30 something got more than a 30% on the first midterm. And the class is that small because so many people dropped it. A very large chunk of the class got less than a 15% on the second midterm, and only 3 people showed up for class when we didn't have to turn in hw. Calc 3 as a subject is NOT hard, but Tignor made it very, very difficult to care because of his poor teaching skills and EXTREMELY difficult midterms. He made the final much easier but by then it was too late for me. I think he passed me out of the kindness of his heart. I took advantage of his office hours towards the end, and that helped a little bit. I would recommend Tignor for a higher level course, but definitely not if math isn't your forte. But then I'm in engineering and I still had serious problems...\nWorkload:\nOne problem set a week (the book is good so this was the easy part), two EXCRUCIATING midterms (expect a page of random proofs, luckily from the textbook but too difficult for even the TAs), and a final that turned out to be much more reasonable (of course I studied proofs and there were only 2 proofs on there)\n"

The class only feels more fast paced because he goes into much more detail about the concepts.  If you don't really care at all and don't find the details interesting, you will not like this class.  However, if you want a detailed (and sometimes furthered) understanding of the material, definately take his course.  By the end of last semester, he has probably fixed up his notes so that you won't have to wait during class for him to figure out his own proofs.\nMake sure to go to almost every one of his lectures because he introduces supplementary material that you won't find anywhere in the textbook.  On the two midterms and the final (which are extremely difficult), he included the supplementary material in high point-valued questions.\nOverall, if you find math interesting and would like a challenge, take his class.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets (random five questions are graded), 2 midterms, final\n"

However, this class was ridiculously hard.  We went at twice the pace of any other calc III class.  He assumes you completely understand the material from the book, and then skips examples and explanations of the basic concepts and goes right to proofs of what seem like semi-tangents, using crazy technical notation.  You are expected to fully understand and remember these proofs, and be able to regurgitate them in a re-worked form on the tests.  This means that if you don't go to class and have a solid calc I (and probably II as well) background, you're screwed.  You also get no formulas during the tests.  He tries to be helpful, but he sure wasn't helpful enough.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets from the book.\n"
