Professor Herb is the only man in the world that can raise a chimpanzee, basically teach it how to talk, dress it in awesome clothes and get a movie made about himself and his off the wall adventures with his furry companion... then turn around and bitch about it. Besides learning that every question is a stupid question and that psychological research is a joke because the whole field is obsessed with impressing this man, you will not learn anything from his lectures. His grumpy rants, only to be interrupted by the prolonged sound of him sipping from his diet coke (or occasional coffee which requires a dry, effortful blow), have little content that you didn't learn in any intro to psych course at any school, community college, or picture book. However, the worst thing about Mr. Terrace's class of buffoonery, was the tests, which he was absent for, which his TA's wrote... In short the tests in this class resemble those written by a dyslexic fourth grader who just discovered adderall. Anywho,the textbook is from the 1960s, unpublished by the man himself, which includes many different fonts and fun misspellings that could be used for drinking games! Finally, the class is curved which is good! Oh wait, it is not? I could have swore he said it was curved... the syllabus says its curved... he gave us our scores during the year on a curve... NOPE! Professor Shouldretire crushed the curve at the last second just as he has crushed so many dreams, GPAs, hearts, and talking-monkey hopes. Damn you Herb, damn you.\nWorkload:\nA few illiterate exams. No need to read any text he gives you, the tests don't cover any of it. The only real workload is the constant fighting with your TAs over questions that have 3 correct answers. \n"

His information is outdated, the tests are mostly illegible and do not reflect the material of the class, and he is an asshole if you try to meet with him in office hours. \nThat being said, the actual content of the class is very interesting.  If any other professor lead the class, I'm sure it would be one of the best in the psych department.  Readings range from scientific articles to magazine articles to a DRAFT of a textbook he tried writing over 15 years ago.  The course would be much better if it just had a standard issue textbook.  \nBut it doesn't matter.  His tests are terrible, not because of the difficulty of the course, but because the answers are sometimes objectively incorrect and because the syntax is at a 5-year old's level.  The TA's often made fun of how ridiculous some of his practice test questions and answers were.  Unfortunately the actual tests were the same if not worse. \nEx. 1: One of the readings explicitly said that pigeons could learn a relational principle.  The answer on his test was that they couldn't.  When brought up in office hours, he said the article was wrong.\nEx. 2: Terrace said that procedural memory is not memory, and even though he understood how this would confuse people on tests since he never explained it to us, he would leave it the same next year.\nEx. 3:  One time Terrace asked the class if we had seen the movie Her.  After barely anybody raised their hand, he promptly spoiled the ending of the movie.  \nTests are often graded so that the difference between an A- and an A+ is one multiple choice question.  At the same time, the difference between a B- and a B+ may be 6 questions.  Not sure if this is common, but it seemed illogical to me.\nI should add that I got an A+ in the course.  Even with that grade, I strongly recommend avoiding anything with Terrace.\nWorkload:\nWeekly pass/fail quizzes you can re-take - 10%\n3 tests - the first was fine, the last 2 were prime examples of how not to write a test.

He really really makes you think, but does not dominate the discussion.  Each person teaches a class, which is basically whatever you make it.  And the subject matter is SO interesting.  Highly recommended.\nOh, and his sense of humor is actually stellar.\nThe one downfall is that he doesn't ever tell you your presentation grade, so you turn in your final paper with NO idea of how you're doing in the class.  But you should just chill out about this.\nWorkload:\nSeminar presentation-- a lot of work, but you pick your topic so it should be interesting.  60 pgs of reading/week assigned by the student presenting.  Not necessary to do all of it, just get a good idea of what will be spoken about.

Although I can't comment on his Intro class, the consciousness seminar was my favorite class of the term - always interesting, always informative.  \nThe course had the usual drawback of a seminar in that you rely on the competance of your collegues who pick weekly readings and give presentations.  The presentations are continually interupted, but this is only annoying if you are giving it and you are unprepared to be sidetracked.  The subject matter is extremely difficult to wrap your mind around but I think Terrace does a commendable job of \"leading the horses to water\" so to speak.  He is certainly an expert in the course's central themes.    \nWorkload:\nCould go either way.  You can put a lot into this class or fairly little.  The weekly readings are assigned by students so they vary in quality and are not tested directly.    You could do many suggested readings (Prof gives a sizeable list) and get a lot out of the course, or fulfill just the minimum: one presentation -1hr or 2hr depending on how many people cover you topic and a take home exam  consisting of one essay that incorporates many course themes.\n"

All you have to do is do the reading, print out the powerpoints and review sheets to study before the tests, and bring specific questions to the TA-sponsored review sessions. (I doubt many other teachers outside of high school give practice tests, key terms, review sessions, and post their lectures online.) The non-cumulative tests are a huge plus, and you can put the class out of your mind before finals officially start.  Also, you will take a short quiz in every discussion section--this is actually a good thing! In my section, as long as you took the quiz, even if you failed, you still received credit for it and all of them added up to 100% averaged in as class participation.

Showing up to class and taking notes on what he says (not the power points-- you can get those later online) prove to be invaluable come exam time, as you learn his random babblings were actually important. \nIn taking this class, I discovered a formula that never failed me. Get a laptop and learn to type fast. During his lectures, instead of focusing on how dry the sound of his voice is, just write down everything he says in bullet format, underneath the headings of the corresponding slide he's showing. A week before each test, print up the slides and match each heading with your notes, and study them that way. It's a no-fail, and excellant preparation for each test. Just take notes on the required readings as well, and you are virtually guaranteed an A on every test. I promise. \nWorkload:\n3 non-cumulative exams-- no final whatsoever.

I began the course with a sincere love of Psychology and a strong desire to make it my major. After taking the final test of the semester, I have neither. Terrace is a truly horrible lecturer, as each of his lectures (as well as his slapdash attempt at a text book) are comprised of many vaguely-related digressions. He utilizes his time in front of the class to speed through the miniscule amount of course material he has to present, and then passes the rest of the hour-and-a-half entertaining himself with random PowerPoint slides that have little relation to what should be the content of the lecture. Unfortunately, there is no source text to consult in case one actually wishes to learn something. Rather, Terrace's students are treated to an manuscript of Terrace's ramblings that is missing essential diagrams, bold-printed key terms, a glossary, and a sense of organization. What makes this even more offensive is that this pile of paper costs $46.10, and CANNOT BE SOLD BACK!! The rest of the reading comes from lengthy artices of slight relevance that, of course, must be photocopied on the student's dime. Countless inconsistencies appear among what is said in the lectures, what is printed in the text, and what the T.A.s have to say in discussion sections. These inconsistencies are naturally left for the student to sort through before the test. However, in spite of Professor Terrace's contempt for his students, it is possible to enjoy bits and pieces of his course due to the innate merits of the material. For the record, I will continue my Psychology track, if for no other reason than to reclaim my love for the material that was thoroughly trampled by Herbert Terrace.\nWorkload:\nThree non-cumulative exams, weekly quizzes (pass/fail) in discussion section\n"

It covers all the basics - history, memory, language, etc. But his lectures are convoluted, seemingly thrown together, and really not worth much at all. If it weren't for good TAs, nothing would make much sense. Basic concepts seem alien until re-explained. Making things even worse is the fact that he uses his own textbook, one that he wrote and apparently never got published. It's unfinished (lots of \"place chart here\"), which is REALLY ANNOYING. It's also as nonsensical as his lectures, so be sure to utilize the TAs! He really shouldn't be teaching, in my opinion - he's clearly smart, but should stick to the lab where he only has to deal with monkeys instead of students.\nWorkload:\nthree exams a semester, non-cumuliative (very nice at finals time because it's already all over). a decent amount of reading, not too much...but make sure you get to the psych library early to get reserve readings - for a huge class, there aren't nearly enough copies on reserve and everything is always gone the week before exams. weekly mandatory discussion sections with a 5-minute pass/fail quiz each time - makes you go to section...if you fail, you can re-take it as many times as neccesary, but not if you miss it. i usually loathe sections, but it definitely helps clear things up for this class. plus, the TAs write the exam, so listening to what they have to say is more valuable than what Terrace tries not to garble.\n"

His lectures are intolerably boring, so much so that only half of the three hundred students attend them on any one-day. This truancy is facilitated by the fact that he wrote his own text book which is basically a transcript of the lectures, and the TA's post the lecture notes on the internet. with these two sources, it is possible to skim by the weekly pass/fail quizzes and the three non cumulative exams, though i do mean skim since the exams are terribly specific. avoid this course if at all possible (psych majors must take it, though it is also taught by Galanter, who i hear is more engaging.)\nWorkload:\nthree non cumulative exams, weekly pass/fail quizzes\n"

He has a great wealth of knowledge of his subject, but lacks the charisma to present it with any real affection. His text book is horribly organized and poorly edited, but informative. Thank goodness there are sections.\nWorkload:\nNot bad at all. 3 NON-CUMULATIVE exams, no final.\n"

That is, if you are stupid enough to attend the excruciatingly boring lectures; stupid, because he wrote the only textbook used and lectures from it verbatim. He even repeats the anecdotes. I'm not kidding. If you for some reason must take this class under pain of death, just read the damn book before the tests and you should be ok. Or you could try the old 'Abracadabra' method, since the inane things are multiple choice.\n"

Even he falls asleep in his own class, no joke. Workload: Leading 1 or 2 classes, which involves a 2-hour speech which is continually interrupted by boring additions from Terrace, and writing an outline for the class to follow and an annotated bibliography on all the extra reading you have to do. Also an in-depth final take-home exam/paper.\n"

Monotonous lectures complement the horrific text -- avoid at all costs.\n"
