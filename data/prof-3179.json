Sometimes has classes that feel like it justs wastes your time, but if you actually do what she asks they will help your essay. She also puts on clips from films during class. Extremely flexible with deadlines. As long as you email her, she is ok with late papers and such.\nWorkload:\n20 page/week (you can get by with 8). 4 essays during the semester.\n"
