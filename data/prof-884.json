We were often assigned chapters to learn on our own and then received little instruction in class other than lots of book exercises , making hte class dismally boring.  I often felt I was teaching myself Italian.  I would not recommend this teacher. \nWorkload:\nlots of book work, homework almost every night, 4 quizes, midterm, final, oral exam, and outside group projects including restaurant review and skit.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nSilvia is excellent. She is careful, attentive, and will answer every question you have. Although she's not a native speaker (she's Bulgarian) her Italian accent isn't a problem, and it actually helps to have a non-native speaker teaching you because she probably had the same problems when learning Italian as you're likely to encounter - this makes it easier for her to identify problem spots for students. She's great fun too... she made us three home-cooked meals. If you have Silvia, make sure you hold on to her - she's absolutely brilliant!\nWorkload:\nLots of busywork - rote exercises etc, but very easy.\n"
