The topics were interesting, Becs is charasmatic and funny, but somehow, despite always completing the reading, this class left me confused. I left it with a pretty good grade but instead of feeling like I had a deeper knowledge of the many issues in women's health, I felt like I had heard a lot of terms and themes and ideas instead of a firm grasp of the material. All in all, I am glad that I took it because I had not expected to ever take a women's studies class and I do feel that some parts of the class really provided insight. I just wish it had been a little more solid. \nOtherwise:\nThe guest lecturers are great; very informative and clear and come with Powerpoints\nBecs can be somewhat disorganized but she is so great as a person\nIt was clear that most people did not do the reading on a daily basis--she once proved this to us by giving a pop quiz\nWorkload:\nToo much reading. Hardly anyone completed all of it. About 6 homework assignments; only have to do 5. Some extra credit opportunities. Poster presentation that counts as a midterm. Final w/ multiple choice and long-answer. Manageable, but kind of a lot.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI expected much more from this class. This rarely offered class was one of the worst I have taken in my several years here. Young  is knowledgeable in the fields of sexuality studies, feminism and women's health, but she seems to have no training in proper ways to conduct a class. When she should have lectured, she had us do useless group work with other confused students, and when she should have let us discuss things, she droned on tangentially. She expected students to fully grasp every word of the readings before lecture, and, with the assumption that we had, rarely addressed the mountains of texts in class at all. She would pull out one point of more than 100 pages of text from the week and waste the entire class asking students puzzling questions which never got to any point. On her assignments, however, she expected clear connections and references, which she did little to help us establish. \nHer TAs had no clear grading objectives and seemed to change their schema from week to week. The weekly assignments were posted late almost every week, sometimes only a few hours before a class, leaving students hanging. When assignments were actually distributed in a timely fashion, the wording made almost no sense. Both Young and her TAs avoided questions asked of assignments, as if taking offense to the idea that they weren't already clearly stated (which they weren't). The midterm assignment was a disaster; no one knew what they were even supposed to do and she never even gave out formal guidelines. Most people seemed upset at C's for what they thought were thoughtful papers.\nI could go on and on about how disappointed I was in this class, so I'll stop now. It is really unfortunate that the Women's Studies department relies so heavily on a professor who cannot come up with a simple syllabus and stick to it.  \nWorkload:\nLaughable reading loads each week (100+ pages a week, 80% of which was usually irrelevant).There was a large midterm field-trip project which did not contribute to my understanding of the material, and a final with a comprehensive study guide (though she would have served us all better if she had actually taught the material throughout the course instead). There are weekly 2 page response papers that were tedious and mostly useless, as the readings did not tie together well usually. We were allowed to skip up to 2 responses. Heavy workload considering that it was a 3 credit course and all of the material was so dense.   \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class is a prime example of why people consider women studies to be a joke. I took this class after sitting in on 2 lectures and being impressed with Prof. Young. When I decided to take it I know I\u00c2\u2019d be made fun of. I heard from almost everyone I knew - you\u00c2\u2019re taking a class in the Barnard women\u00c2\u2019s studies department?! My response was, the class is a serious epidemiology class using women and their relationship to the healthcare system as a case study.\nI ATE my words. This class was a boring waste of time. There are maybe 2 lectures that have interesting material.  Everything else \u00c2\u2013 you know or should know. There was a visiting lecture by one of the barnard deans in which we were asked \u00c2\u2013 \u00c2\u201cdoes everyone know what DNA is?\u00c2\u201d I am NOT kidding. Other classes included sobbing \u00c2\u2013 sharing your experiences psychobabble waste of my time. In one class we were told to spend 15 minutes reflecting on our 1st gynecology exam. The next 20 minutes were spent sharing different peoples stories. It is not appropriate in an academic setting to spend time like that. I guess it was good there were no guys in the class. You might be asking yourself \u00c2\u2013 why did I go to lecture  if it was such a waste of time? Lecture is required. Prof. Young passes around a sign in sheet.\nIn terms of work and other requirements. Prof Young was so vague that nobody quite knew what was going on. When we were told we had midterm poster presentations, it wsan\u00c2\u2019t until someone asked a question about where to buy the poster board that she clarified the \u00c2\u201cposters\u00c2\u201d were actually wiki files to be made online. Not that that helped much seeing as noone had every heard of a wiki file (except having to do with wikipedia) and that didn\u00c2\u2019t help clarify the assignments.\nTo be fair, some of the reading is interesting \u00c2\u2013 if you\u00c2\u2019re willing to spend the over $200 on coursebooks/packs for the class. If you\u00c2\u2019re generally intelligent and don\u00c2\u2019t mind the money you\u00c2\u2019re spending on an education to be wasted, the class is an easy A (at least I really don\u00c2\u2019t understand how anyone could not have gotten an A in the class)\n\nWorkload:\nsome homeworks, online quizzes, midterm 'poster' presentation, and final. she gives a comprehensive study guide for the final. \n"

Also, she spends each class on a different topic so you cover so many topics superficially and then she expects you to know tem all for hte final.  the class seems a lot more intimidating than it actually is though.  I barely did anything in that class and managed to pull off an A.  She also gives a comprehensive study guide for the final with everything you need to know on it.  Overall I thought this class was really intersting but very one-sided.  She actually states in the beginning of the course that the material we will be learning is from a strictly feminist perspective so that kind of gets annoying sometimes because some of the information feels more like perspective than actual fact. \nWorkload:\nfairly light.  There is a lot of reading that you don't have to do but some of it is really interesting.  there is one poster presentation instead of a midterm which is a lot easier than people thought it would be.  she just wanted somthing really simple and i think that confused a lot of people.  the final was also not very hard.  she gave like 3 homework assignemnts that were all fairly simple and short.\n"

Though Becks is extremely knowledgable on HIV/AIDs, the HIV/AIDS class was her worst--she forgot her slides and forgot how to teach without them.  The material is outdated and very rooted in the 60s and 70s.  Most of the material complains about how bad things were for women's health then, how little improvement there was in the 80s, and barely gets into the 90s or 00s. Instead of establishing in the beginning that there was injustice towards women in basically all aspects of health, Becks devotes most of each lecture to repeatedly lamenting how women were gypped in treatment of each disease.\nGuest lecturers were hit and miss--Brenda Slade, Jenny Higgins and the director of the Columbia Rape Crisis Center were AMAZING--but many others were so boring I wanted to cry.  Becks doesn't attend most guest lecturs, so not only does she repeat a lot because she was unaware of what was covered, but she doesn't try to establish any cohesiveness between herself and all the guests she brings in.  You are allowed two absences, and attendance is taken every single lecture.\nWorkload:\nSix assignments (she drops your lowest), 1 website presentation in lieu of a midterm (interestng but very hard) and a final\n"

Although she gives outlines for the midterm and final, the HWs and quizes are sooo frustrating and badly worded. Even if you know the stuff backwards and forwards, you are bound to get screwed. Plus, the HWs and quizes are worth so much that your grade is still low...(she also only curves to a B-). I had to ask her for re-grades on almost everything, (where many mistakes in her grading were found each time). Also- she just sent a mass email to my entire class, because, apparently there were so many complaints about final grades that didn't seem to fit- that she had to go back and regrade everything. The subject is definately interesting (although remember it is a gender studies class, not a bio one- at all.) Overall,though, she is a nice person and makes class fun, but you have to be able to deal with all of her grading frustrations.. \n"

Prof. Young brings it tons of guest lecturers - some of whom are interesting and some not - because she recognizes that it is most interesting to hear experts in their specific fields talk about their work.  Prof. Young can be very neat to talk to, but her own lectures are often not that compelling.  I think she is so nervous about making a mistake/ being insensitive or not PC that it limits her ability to freely talk about issues to students with only limited knowledge.  Though the reading is fascinating, it is often unnecessary and doesn't tie directly into class except in the reading comprehension questions she asks.  This class is worth taking for reading material it would be hard for humanities students to find otherwise, but the lectures and small homeworks are often not rewarding.\nWorkload:\nlots of reading (that is interesting); nitty gritty homeworks that are pretty tedious\n"

There was also soooo much unnecessary reading like 80 pages per class that didn't even make it on the final. The class focused more on women in the health system and the different kinds of studies dealing with disease and exposure than it did with women and their health in a biological sense.

Beck Young is an amazing person - she teaches several intense classes, she's fun, she's a parent, she's writing a book, and she's done a lot of influential research.  She knows pretty much everything there is to know about women and health, in both history and current news.  But sometimes her class is kind of confusing; the questions on the homeworks aren't really straightforward, and often she just rambles, which is interesting but not always conducive to a good grade, for those who care more about grades than about learning. A lot of the readings are quite medical and a little abstruse for non-premed students, but mostly it's fascinating and relevant to your life (even if you are not a woman!).  She had several guest lecturers, who added to our knowledge and scope but I thought there were a couple too many.  She is very enthusiastic and her language is very precise; she obviously cares about her subject; but with such a wide topic it was hard to cram everything in.  There were some topics I wish she'd spent less time on and some I felt she completely ignored.  But I am definitely walking away from this class with a much better understanding of women and health and all the complex issues surrounding it.  I'm really glad I took this class, and am going to be a women's studies major largely because of it.\nWorkload:\na ton of reading that is very interesting but not necessary.  a few homeworks where you just answer some questions.  a couple online quizzes, a midterm (avg grade was a B i think) and final.  a large research project that counts for i think 20%, and we had to attend a sexual violence workshop and write a paragraph on it.  attendance is mandatory and i think she factors it into your grade.\n"

The environment of her class contradicts learning--it thwarts more of it than it stimulates.  She seems to feel insecure about the perception of the subject, Women and Health, as easy.  She addresses this insecurity by trying to make an inherently straightforward class difficult.  She concocts a grading scheme and style to ensure that the average grade is lower than it should be in order to prove to the world that Women and Health is a rigorous and challenging field.  I wish she had realized that that by enrolling in her class, students already acknowledge that the subject belongs in Academia and were there to be awakened to and excited by it--instead Professor Young turned me off to Women's Studies altogether.  Don't let her seemingly organized syllabus dupe you; the class is not well structured or thematic, it is disjointed.  Her lectures are boring.  Some of the readings are great.

Prof. Young has an unusually high tolerance for stupid questions and fails to tell people that asking dumb questions in class does not count as class participation.  The kind of stupidity displayed during class wouldn't have been allowed in my elementary school.  Although lectures were usually cool, the discussion sometimes made class unbearable (girls, listen up: no one wants to hear about your 158  trips to the gynecologist). The midterm actually wasn't hard, but because of nitpicky grading, people did badly even if they obviously had a good understanding of the material.   The homeworks are graded just as harshly.
