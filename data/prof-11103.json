            "review_content": "\nProfessor Zorych is a really nice guy. He always asked for our input and considered it, even when it came to the distribution of percentages for our grades and whether we wanted our grades to be curved or not. His lectures were incredibly boring though. He usually had a powerpoint with class notes, and examples which he usually worked out on the board. I would say there were 50+ people registered for his class but no more than 20 showed up on a typical class day. Can't blame this entirely on him though, as statistics just seemed like a really boring subject to me.\nBoth midterms were really reasonable, but the final was much harder than expected. We were allowed to use calculators for all three. He also replaced our lowest midterm grade if problems in the final from those sections had higher scores.\nHe assigned homework about once a week, which included around 10-25 problems. I was surprised with the number in many of them since most math classes I've taken at Columbia usually don't assign more than 10. He also dropped our two lowest homework grades.\nOverall I'm glad I took the class with Professor Zorych because he is a legitimately nice guy and if I have to go through statistic it might as well be with him, but his lectures are pretty boring. If you have a hard time staying awake during boring lectures you will likely skip (along with over half the class) and will end up having to teach yourself statistics.\nWorkload:\nWeekly Homeworks (20%), 2 Midterms (22.5% each), Final (35%)\n\n"
