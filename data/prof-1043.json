            "review_content": "\nAlma Mora is the sweetest lady, and I definitely recommend her as a professor. I do agree that most of the time I have no idea what she is saying or what's going on, but I think that's how it is in the Spanish department in general. It's the teaching method. Professor Mora barely gives any homework, and I find it to be an incredibly light load. You can skimp if you want; a lot of stuff is not graded, she just wants you to look over the material that will be covered in the next class. Professor Mora is also an easy grader; I was able to put in minimal effort and get A's. If you put in an effort to make is seem like you really care and really want to do well, Professor Mora is very receptive to that. Go to office hours a few times. Participate in class. Ask questions. It's easy.\nAs for the classes themselves, very little material was covered, and they are quite easy compared to part II of each.\nWorkload:\nWorkbook pages (no more than 10) every few weeks\nThree essays (around 200 words or so)\nMidterm\nOral Final\nWritten Final\n"

            "review_content": "\nGet in someone else's class if you can. She assigns so much homework online and in the grammar book. Also, in the grammar book, you can't just bring your book to class and let her check it- you have to write it in your book, scan it, then upload it to Courseworks by midnight. It's such a hassle, and she gets easily annoyed if something goes wrong in uploading it. She doesn't care if you can open your grammar book and show her you did it. Like the last reviewer said, she laughs all time and no one knows why. That was cool with me in the beginning, but I started to notice that sometimes she would be laughing at the way some people spoke Spanish. If they used the wrong words or said it really slowly or something, she would giggle at them. Lastly, I noticed that a lot of people in my class had no idea what was going on most of the time because of the way she taught. The most common example of this in her class was she would speak super fast and then stare at us. We would stare back.Finally we would figure out that she had just told us to do some activity, but literally no one understood her well enough to know what to do initially. She isn't the best professor, honestly. Find another one.\nWorkload:\nA lot of work in the grammar book (usually took me about 3 hours, including scanning and uploading), Myspanishlab work due every week, two tests, oral exam, compositions, video project.\n"

I would not describe her as particularly kind but she laughs a lot most of the time no one knows why.  She assigns A LARGE QUANTITY of homework, pages from the workbook at least after every class and a lot of packets.  Many grammar book and myspanish assignments and we had to watch 3 movies and do lots of work for each one with very little time to do so.  The final project was absurd and required research, mini compositions, a wiki page, and 2 videos, one interviewing a chef that had to cook food in a restaurant that pertained to the assigned country (some people were given countries like Uruguay or Bolivia so it was near impossible) and another video of you \"talking naturally\" is Spanish in a restaurant and you had to order a dish that pertained to your assigned country and do additional research on it.  I repeat STAY AWAY.  This would maybe be worth it if I learned a lot but I did not, she does not teach well and I regressed in knowledge if anything.  GET OUT NOW\nWorkload:\nMUCH MORE THAN ANY OTHER SEMESTER OF SPANISH THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessora Mora is an excellent professor. This is my fourth semester of Spanish, and I have had her for the last two. She couldn't be more helpful, professional and kind. She never embarrasses students in class by putting them on the spot. Prof Mora does some correcting, but does not demand perfection when we speak in class, and the reduction of that anxiety for her students facilitates cognitive ability to learn- at least for me it does. There energy in class is positive. She has a sense of humor about life, and gives lessons tailored to areas in which the class is weak and needs extra instruction. Many students who had her last semester registered for her classes again this semester.\nDepartmental suggestions: 1) Gramatica B\u00c3\u00a1sica is great, especially the humorous bits!  2) The Spanish text book is not great. 3) MSL needs to give more and better feed back for incorrect answers. 4) WIKI technology needs to be updated to the 21st century. 5) Grad students who are inexperienced teachers should not teach classes.\nOverall, excellent Spanish program, and I recommend Professora Mora.\nWorkload:\n3 compositions based on Spanish films, Workbook, MSL, midterm and final exams. \n"

            "review_content": "\nMora is a very, very nice person.  She often extends deadlines for students if they forget something or if something goes wrong on a project.  However, she does assign a LOT of work. I had more work for this class than any other class- and this class wasn't a part of my major and just a requirement!  She is very sweet but she's not a great teacher.  She sometimes struggled to explain certain concepts in English as she's a native Spanish speaker.  The course was manageable but expect to spend a LOT of time doing work for her.\nWorkload:\nMySpanishLab due every 2 weeks (takes about 2-3 hours total but can be spread out over the 2 weeks).  Workbook problems due at the end of the semester (not too many but enough).  3-4 compositions due (rough draft and final) which were very time-consuming.  Required us to watch 3-4 full-length Spanish films (often requiring an accompanying composition) which was also obviously time-consuming, as she'd have the film/composition due 2-5 days later.  One midterm which wasn't too difficult, one easy oral exam, and one final which I have yet to take but have heard it's not too difficult.  One final project which was EXTREMELY time-consuming (required 2 compositions, a PowerPoint, an interview with a Hispanic professor that you had to find on your own, research, and a presentation),  The workload was the biggest complaint of all students.\n"

She has a good sense of humor and understands that most people in the class are not there by choice, but rather to fulfill a requirement.  She does a lot of partner work and work in small groups, which helps students to get more practicing in.  She will go over anything twice so long as you ask.\nThe only negative thing I have to say is that she goes over the homework very briefly towards the end of class in spanish, so its sometimes hard to understand.  This can be frustrating, but if you shoot her an email, she will get back to you that same day.\nWorkload:\n1 midterm, 1 final, 4 written compositions and a bunch of work from the textbooks.  DO THE WORK IN THE SPANISH GRAMMAR BOOK...it doesn't seem like she's going to collect it at the end, but she will.\n"

I was anxious about taking a language, but the fact of the matter is she's always behind schedule and that works to your benefit in terms of workload, not Spanish learning. \nShe really tried to foster a stress-free environment and emphasized conversation in class every day, and I would say she succeeded. Grammar was secondary to conversation, which was made abundantly clear the last week when she tried to teach us three tenses in two days.I'm heading into comprehensive intermediate now, and I'm a little nervous, though not so much about speaking - but actually knowing enough grammar/vocab.\nWorkload:\nLighter than you'd expect.. She assigns homework, but NEVER checks it. We just went over the exercises and did them all in class, which means by the third week, you'll stop doing the homework at home. That was how much of class was spent. Department midterm and final, as well as a short, easy oral exam. Three compositions that she edits and allows you to rewrite for an average grade. \n"

Midway through the semester Professora Mora tightened up and demanded a page in spanish for every class on assigned articles to make us participate.  Which was a shame, because if she had just reached out to the class for topics that we genuinely wanted to discuss, we probably would have wanted to be so prepared on our own...  She's pleasant enough, but if I were to take another conversation class, it would be with someone else.\nWorkload:\nSeems a bit much for a two point course\n"

In these 3 or session she, assigns exercises from the text due for each class period, and expects the entire work book chapter (20 pages of fill in the blank type stuff) to be done, and wants us to be ready for a quiz. The entire semester runs like that with 4 compositions, midterm, and final somewhere in between. Once we had a quiz and the Midterm in 2 consecutive sessions. She also expects a lot more in terms of proficiency from her student than she reasonably gets at this level. Expect many session to consist of blank looks as she yells in spanish about how we really need to start understanding more. Bodas de Sangre is brutal. No one knew what was going on and we sat there class after class in painful silence. \nWorkload:\nHomework every class, Chapter quiz every 3-4 classes, Workbook for each chapter, 4 compositions, Midterm, Final\n"

What happened was although she's good-natured, it was rather rare that Alma actually managed to connect with the class. Most of the time she gave off this aura of tiredness. Often her in-class assignments just didn't work.\nWorkload:\nWorksheets or exercises almost every day (but you go through these in class). What you do have to hand in are the four essays, and the workbook - there's a quiz on each chapter (except near the midterm and the final), which is when you hand in each chapter of the workbook.\n"
