Sebasien Rivat is the better TA but Simon Brown is also pretty good. I was in Simon's recitation and his only problem is that we never had time to go through all the week's material, although it's really Varzi's problem for being unclear in lectures and therefore necessitating a complete review of all the material in recitation. I got an A in the course but I feel like I understand max 60% of the material. Also the course catalog claims the course has no prerequisites but it would have been helpful to have taken logic before this course. \nWorkload:\n2 midterms, each 25%\n1 final, 40%\nRecitation participation, 10%\n"

It's a great introduction to analytic philosophy in general and metaphysics in particular. It's extremely theoretical. It's not until the second to last week in which you learn something that actually seems relevant to the world. Nevertheless, the material and method of analysis are rigorous and interesting, and maybe you'll come to really care about some of the more theoretical, abstract topics (like, maybe the world should have a coherent description of identity or the possibility of backward time travel).\nGrading is not bad and the workload is very light. If you've been to class you'll be able to do the take home assignments. Going to class is highly recommended. He covers everything in the reading in class and will test specifically about things he talked most about in lecture.\nWorkload:\n2 Take Home Assignments - short answer questions\n1 Take Home Final - also short answer questions\n"

Heavy accent, wild hair, and surrounded by eager Grads and Undergrads pretty much everywhere he goes. Strikes a perfect balance between humorous and maniacal genius. Very approachable, and thoughtful, and known within the Philosophy community as one of the best teachers available. \nThe course itself, Varzi will tell you, ascends and descends along a linear plane of difficulty. He's not afraid to tell you when the difficulty is increasing dramatically so you can be extra prepared/cautious in the work. First Order Logic is pretty much the equivalent of doing complex calculus in an alien language. Nevertheless, you'll start out slow, and TA sections are extremely beneficial. I struggled with the material nearly the entire course - most students did - but I left with a sincere appreciation for the tradecraft, and quite refreshingly aware of the pitches and turns in many complex philosophical arguments. \nTaking any course with Varzi is going to be a worthwhile experience, and I would highly encourage Symbolic Logic as an excuse to do just that. \nWorkload:\nSeveral graded homework assignments (time consuming but no overly demanding), two mid-terms (moderately difficult), and a final (quite difficult). \n"

I won't expound much on his positives because all the other reviews have already addressed them.\nI'll just point out a few flaws with the class. First of all, you never get your homework assignments returned, which is frustrating. Second of all, for the first many weeks of the class, it moves absurdly slowly for anyone with a somewhat mathematical inclination. I understand that many people find the material difficult, but I found the stuff at the beginning is mind-numbingly simple. (My apologies to the philosophy majors in the class who found it difficult.) On a related note, he has a tendency to go on long, rambling tangents -- they're sometimes amusing, just be prepared for it. Finally, Varzi can get somewhat terse/rude when people asks questions. There were a couple of times where he misunderstood someone's question and instead of being apologetic, he got annoyed at the student for not having phrased his question differently.\nAll in all, it's not a bad class, I just wanted to give a slightly different view from everyone else.\nWorkload:\nVery light: 3 problem sets, 2 midterms, and 1 final. There are also weekly discussion sections where attendance may or may not be taken (if you understand everything in class, there's literally no reason to go).\n"

Most of the formal training was in the mid-term and final exam.  The assignments were not difficult, but it would have been more informative if we went over lots of proofs in class.  And, though this was not necessarily the subject of the class, I would have been very interested to learn some metatheory about the logics that we studied.\nWorkload:\nSeveral reading assignments, never tested in any way.

However, be warned, If you dislike math or tedious problems with symbols, do not take this class. Varzi is a nice guy and clear lecturer, but his charm fades off with the boring subject of the class. I expected to leave this class having somehow improved my logic, but ended up hating logic and its seamingly pointless material. Honestly I feel that I have gained nothing from this class. The textbook is also useless, but Varzi posts all his lectures, which makes attending class unnecessary. The problems sets aren't too hard, what is hard is trying to understand the vague instructions in the book. For a book on logic, the intstructions aren't very logical as they are unclear and oddly worded. Ultimately, this is the least enjoyable class I have taken at Columbia, except perhaps Statistics, but at least statistics is useful for something. \n"

I knew a number of people in each class who were not philosophy majors--I strongly recommend that no matter what your field, you take a course with Professor Varzi. If you're interested in logic and/or philosophy of language it will be a good way to further your interest--since even metaphysics has become in a number of important aspects a mainly linguistic field. If you're not particularly interested in these areas, he will surely interest you in at least a few of the topics covered in the classes. For instance, we talked seriously about time travel for a week in  Metaphysics--he's written some very funny stuff about it himself. (Of the few of his own publications on the syllabus--most with a co-author as he humbly points out whenever he mentions them--one was a case-study of groups involving the Chicago Bulls; another was a humorous exchange about time travel.) In class, he always cracks a few jokes and has the entire class laughing--even in Logic. He makes each new topic very clear and guides the class through their major interpretations and problems. After class and in office hours he is extremely approachable, friendly, and helpful. I'm afraid I don't have much to add to the reviews here since everyone seems to agree on his greatness. Definitely, whether or not you're a philosophy major, take a class with this guy. Not a single better professor in the department as far as I can tell, and he is among the best at the university I'm sure.\nWorkload:\nLogic: The assigned readings in the textbook are really not necessary if you go to class and follow Varzi's very clear lectures which he posts prior to each class so that students can print them and follow along in class. Weekly homework--helpful, though not particularly important for the grade; 2 Midterms and a Final--very fair, transparently graded, and consistent in structure.\nMetaphysics: Reading for each class, not overwhelming; 2 Take-home assignments, kind of like metaphysics problem sets in that they are not the vague kind of assignments that sometimes crop up in humanities courses. They really require you to think hard about some of the topic covered in class. Varzi switched the final to a take-home of the same nature as the midterms. The midterms, 3 or 4 questions each, could not be more than a page. The final he was a bit more flexible with, but could be done in the same space.\n"

Though it would have been nice to move through the material at a faster pace... it was not boring at all. Even though there were like 30-50 people who actually attended the classes, the room was packed with well over 100 on test days. I would definately recommend going to the classes, because if you go to all the classes and do all the homework... there is really no need to study very much--or even at all.\nI had two minor issues with the class (neither of which are Prof Varzi's fault). First: the TA's. Maybe they really were intelligent and knowledgeable people, but they certainly didn't prove it when they tried teaching the class one day. They were saying stuff that was obviously incorrect and it made me really appreciate Prof Varzi. Thankfully, that was the only time I ever dealt with the TAs. Second: people do ask some really stupid questions. Especially when they start contributing retarded hypothetical situations that are completely ridiculous (but then again there are people like that in most classes). \nEven though those 2 things were annoying, the class was great and I would absolutely definitely recommend it!  It's light in terms of workload, but you still feel like you are learning something, which is always nice.\nWorkload:\nWeekly homeworks, 2 midterms, and a final.
