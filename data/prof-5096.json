            "review_content": "\nThis class offers a recitation period with the professor, which is something more classes really should do.  For a survey class like this, the recitations are a great chance to reinforce the readings and to force you think more critically about them.  The TAs can be hit or miss, so if you like the professor, I completely recommend taking her recitation.  (Plus, it gives you more of a chance to build a relationship with her.)\nGrading for this class is inexcusably slow.  The midterm took over a month to get back.  The next semester has already started and I still haven't gotten my grade for the course.\nThat said, she's pretty understanding on her end with deadlines.  So if you're a little bit late turning a paper in, it shouldn't be a problem.\nShe's a very personable teacher with some very specific knowledge.  Though she doesn't know all the broad strokes, she creates a very warm and welcome environment, which is great in an introductory level class.\nWorkload:\n1 midterm (6-8 pages), 1 response to the readings (2 pages) and 2 final papers (6 pages and 10-12 pages)\n"
