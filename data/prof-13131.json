            "review_content": "\nIt is with great disdain that I write this review. You don't really have a choice about taking this class. So, the issue is how best to cope. \nIssues with the course: \nToo many topics covered in very little depth \nInsane problem sets with hundreds of problems summing up each unit (not necessarily helpful)\nPowerpoint lectures with many mistakes in them, and contain tons of extraneous information \nNo formula sheets for exams. The final therefore means memorizing hundreds of formulas and being able to \"free-recall\" on command. \nIssues with the professor: \nCharnick is rude and condescending. Naturally, that makes her unapproachable. I cannot emphasize this enough. \nShe assigned a problem set due the Monday of finals. \nMakes her exams way too long for a 50 minute period. Absolutely no time to check over work. You will most definitely run out of time taking one of her exams. Sorry. \nVery poor handwriting and talks in monotone...very poor note delivery on the board. \nCan't explain the material properly! \nThe point: yes, you will have to teach this course to yourself. It's unfortunate, but what can you do. The BC chemistry sequence, which I think is wonderful, (Rojas and Magyar were great) leaves a lot to be desired with this course. \n\nWorkload:\n4 exams, 1 final, 14 problem sets with 30+ questions each. \n"
