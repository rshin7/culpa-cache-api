She's a great German teacher who strikes a really good balance between getting everybody to participate but without horrifyingly embarrassing them. She was extremely reasonable when it came to workload, and is very responsive via email or after class. I feel like I learned a lot of German (I also happened to really like the textbook) but without a high level of stress. Definitely recommend her.\nWorkload:\nEntirely reasonable. In fact, I'd dare to call it practically nonexistent. Essays are super chill, tests aren't bad if you study just for a little bit, and the final was the gentlest test I've ever taken.\n"
