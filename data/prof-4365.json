The lectures are comically easy for the first two-thirds of the course (what a wavelength is, etc.), and then suddenly jump into incomprehensible for the last few weeks. Chris is friendly but not a great lecturer. The class is mostly masters students who have experience with ENVI, so Chris has little incentive to explain things particularly well. I'm happy with the grade I ended up with, but the class itself is like pulling teeth. Tip: download and save all of the instructions he posts for labs because he takes them down with no warning before he hands out the midterm and final. All in all I wouldn't recommend the class. \nWorkload:\nGrade is only the midterm and final (not even attendance for the lab is counted). The midterm and final are really really hard. He's going to say you could do the whole thing in a couple hours, but don't be misled. \n"
