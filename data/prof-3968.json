            "review_content": "\nProf Han is extremely caring. A very talented, smart, and interesting professor. Her class is less about intensive readings as it is about discussion and introspection. Asian-American psychology is still a very new field and so there is no real established curriculum or textbook for it; instead, a lot of the learning comes from discussion, making observations on daily life, and doing related readings (from journal articles to contemporary fiction). Recommended for those with an interest in Asian-Americans, obviously.  However, at times it does slightly feel like things discussed in class could probably be generalized for any immigrant and not just Asian-Americans. \nWorkload:\nThree papers 25% of grade each - all very manageable (around 5 pages). Remaining 25% is class participation. No exams. An easy class, but also rewarding if effort is seriously devoted. \n"
