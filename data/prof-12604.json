Definitely go to his classes. He has a great sense of humor.\nMy only complaint is that sometimes, his slides had errors or were slightly confusing (the TAs confirmed this).\nTravis was a fantastic TA. Definitely go to his office hours. By the end of the semester there was a crew people who religiously went every week because he was so helpful.\nWorkload:\nWeekly assignments\nMidterm\nFinal\n"
