            "review_content": "\nHistory of the South was a really interesting class. It gave me a view of the South that I'd never seen before, and Professor Fields definitely made an effort to look at all sides of a lot of issues--not just spinning the popular interpretation, as many professors do, but really positing her own deeply thought-out conclusions about things. She was a pretty intimidating woman, though, and didn't really invite people to question her interpretations or to participate in any sort of discussion.\nThe readings were generally very long, but usually fascinating. Discussing them in section was usually one of my favorite parts of the week, especially because my TA, Lindsey, was THE best TA I've ever had or will ever have. Lindsey knew the texts inside and out and really knew how to explain the complicated issues that Professor Fields didn't get into in class. She also required us to turn in multiple stages of our final paper ahead of time, which made me much more time-conscious on the paper and made for a much better paper in the end. Lindsey's line edits on our papers were also priceless.\nWorkload:\n100-200 pages of reading per class\nDiscussion section\nMidterm\nFinal\nTerm paper (10 pages)\n"

            "review_content": "\nBy far the best professor I've had at Columbia. If it weren't for this class, which, admittedly, I stumbled into during my sophomore spring and almost dropped after the first lecture, I wouldn't have decided to major in history and would have no idea what to do with my life. A Marxist of the old-fashioned sort that we don't see too often these days, Fields is explicit in her approach to history. I learned in her course what type of distinctions count as historically meaningful, what particular features of the past count as explanations rather than things to be explained, and how to begin to distinguish a particular society at a particular time from any other at multiple levels of analysis (economic, political, ideological, artistic, etc.). She is extremely attentive to detail, and insists on proper use of terminology (expect to be corrected on things you've never even thought of), especially concerning race. Having never previously questioned the validity of the concept of race, her lectures on the subject were particularly revealing for me. \nI could go on, but you can spare yourself my gushing if you simply TAKE HER CLASS. If you're a junior or a senior looking to find those classes you missed out on before you started digging into your major, this is one of them. If you're a freshman or a sophomore still figuring out what you want to study, take this class and the decision should be pretty easy (major in history). \nWorkload:\nWay too much reading, but it's mostly good. She mostly chooses the books on the syllabus for a very specific reason. I developed an unhealthy fondness for historiography after taking this course. Mostly secondary sources, but some fiction, including a very funny novel by Faulkner. \n1 final paper, 12-15 pages. It's a historiographical review rather than a research paper, which is some relief from the workload. Go to her office hours to talk about it.\nMidterm and final.\n"

She does not use email, she does not collect any written work except your final paper proposal until the last day of class, she does care about the formatting of footnotes, and she will give you a 12 page document of her written style and word usage pet peeves. She will also treat you with more respect in the classroom (which entails challenging you to really substantiate your assertions and back up your reasoning) than almost any other professor I have had. Fields is initially intimidating, but incredibly kind (go to her office hours) and a brilliant and accomplished scholar. Disregard the negative reviews. If you are prepared to work hard and to be taken seriously, take this class. \nWorkload:\nAmazing syllabus - Woodward, Jefferson, Douglass, Faulkner, Welty, Toomer, etc.\nWeekly discussion postings + a weekly 1-3 page response for a reading journal to be turned in at the end of the semester + final paper\n"

Kindness, however, should not be mistaken for intellectual coasting -- she is a very opinionated and intelligent and she will tell you when you are being an idiot. She is very incisive in her historical analysis and made me look at history from a new perspective, but that being said, I can't call her one of the greats of the History department. There are some lectures that are fascinating in which she makes a decisive and insightful point about Southern history. But, at other times, it feels like I'm listening to the audio book of a high school text book, her just listing important events and dates. \nAll in all, you'll learn a lot and her lecture and article on Race and Ideology is a must.

If you leave columbia without taking her class, especially as a history major, you've missed something very special.  Her lectures are pieces of literature that will probably be published as a book someday. You should probably have some background in American history before you take the course otherwise it might seem overwhelming, but if you have Matt Spooner as your TA, you should be fine as he is really good. If you have Gregory Baggett, however, look out. The man is insane and made a girl cry in my section because she didn't have good manners when entering the room. Baggett is the greatest danger in this course, but even if you have to brave his insanity, it might still be worth it to get to take the course with Fields.  I know many people who became history majors after taking her course.  \nWorkload:\nIt's a lot of work, no joke, and the paper has very high expectations although it is a very reasonable assignment. Be prepared to correct your grammar, punctuation and footnote styles as she does not accept sloppiness in any of these respects. The reading is extensive, but all classic and important works of history, so well worth the significant investment of time. \n"

A class, especially a history class, should be more than the sum of its reading list, and Professor Fields\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 History of the South excelled in that regard, an impressive feat considering the high quality of the assigned texts. Nonetheless, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enter the class expecting to tackle the reading list. I doubt I finished half of it, and agree with other reviewers that it is an unreasonable amount. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m far less likely to read even 200 pages a week if 450 have been assigned, which was not uncommon in this class, whereas I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m more likely to read 200 pages if only 200 pages are assigned. Weekly response pages increase the burden and hold you accountable for the reading, however attention in class, selective reading, and the occasional JSTOR book review can keep you on track and engaged. Professor Fields is an impressive and powerful lecturer and very open to undergraduates in office hours. Be warned though\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe is very particular about word choice, which can make asking questions difficult  (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you really mean \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfundamental\u00e2\u20ac\u2122? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think X was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfundamental\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at all.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), and she insists on using the phone rather than email. In this regard, having a great TA (as my class did) makes a huge difference, especially since s/he grades all undergraduate work. Workload and communication qualms aside, I highly recommend this class. A serious, honest effort can earn you an A, but more importantly give you a huge appreciation of Southern history.  \nWorkload:\nHeavy reading, even for a history class (average 350p./week); weekly response page (300-500 words)for discussion section; 10-page term paper based on comparison of two books; midterm; final.\n"

But she assigns a lot of reading material, takes attendence during every lecture (sign in sheet), politely requests that students not stuff their faces during lectures, and requests that students arrive on-time.  I think those are reasonable requests.  Habitually tardy students and food chompers are unbelievably annoying.

While Professor Fields may teach you the mechanics of history, she will revulse you from the art  and significance of history.

I thought she was a basically warm person who was very serious about history.  She IS  very demanding.  On the one hand, this means that her responses to your in-class comments will usually be humbling, her grading is tough and meticulous and the workload is very high. On the other hand, it means that, unlike most other professors I've had, she actually takes your work and comments seriously.  When you bust your ass to write a 12 page paper,  most professors and TA's will only write a short paragraph of comments at the end, and maybe a few in the margins.  Fields actually engages with your arguments and writes detailed responses- to everything: the weekly journal entries that she has collected, your rough draft, and your final paper.  If you have the time to spend on these things, she gives back as much as she expects, which is saying a lot.  She's intelligent and inspiring and I learned a lot in her class. \n       DONT take this class if you don't want this kind of challenge.
