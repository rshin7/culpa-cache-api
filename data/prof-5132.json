            "review_content": "\nThis is a survey course (much more breadth than depth) which covers a very very wide number of areas in sustainability and management. At some points I wondered if it could be better organized as a series of lectures by experts on various subjects.  Some of the management material seemed basic to those who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a bit of corporate / real world experience (and / or a MBA) but the purpose of this class may be to bring everyone up to some basic level of knowledge. Professor Apsan is an affable person who tries to be friendly and entertaining but it is tough teaching survey level material to such a large class.\nWorkload:\nThere are four books to read plus a modest amount of article reading and viewing of online videos (my favorite!). The assignments include four very carefully crafted two-page essays plus one very carefully crafted three page essay (final exam).  There is also a group project (and presentation to the class by the group) which is reasonable in workload. Overall this class has a very manageable workload. Please note that when I used the phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very carefully crafted\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in regards to the writing assignments that I did not use these words lightly.  You should very very carefully write your essays to conform with the expected format and content (i.e. answer all the questions).\n"
