He was kind of awkward first semester (we spent way too much time doing group discussion, which idk if he noticed, was not about the text...we were talking but ... yeah), but got better second semester, he knew that material pretty well.Unfortunately class also got lazier second semester, a lot of the the students who actually participated switched to other classes..  I was constantly bored but it got better later on plus he invited his friend to come talk once or twice and he was pretty good. Overall, I enjoyed this class. It was mad chill plus Joe is a cool guy, he cares about the stuff he talks about.   \nWorkload:\nNot much.\n"
