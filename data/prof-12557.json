            "review_content": "\nThis is Gupta's first year teaching, and it is painfully obvious.  \nHer lectures were pretty ordinary - there was nothing that could not have been learned by just reading the textbook.  She often slipped up in her teaching or did not have answers for student questions.  She did not seem confident at all in her teaching, although by the end of the semester she did seem a little more comfortable in this position.\nThis class was nothing special and I don't recommend taking it if you are actually interested in abnormal psychology.\nHer grading was pretty annoying, there was no curve at all, so a few missed questions on each exam would leave you with a pretty bad grade for a super easy class.  It seemed that this no curve situation was a result of a first-year teaching complex, because the grading was pretty ridiculous. \nWorkload:\n3 exams, last is non-cumulative final\n4 in class quizzes (print out the slides for class so you have the answers)\n1 extra credit paper (to raise your grade by 1%)\n"
