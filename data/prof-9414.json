            "review_content": "\nI've taken three classes with Cassie (1 lecture and 2 seminars) and she is definitely on my top 3 list of favorite professors at Columbia. She is extremely dedicated, understanding, challenging, and accessible. One of the things that I really appreciate about Cassie is that she always urges us and pushes us to articulate our ideas and thoughts with more simplicity and clarity (while at the same time pushing us to make our preliminary thoughts more complete), as opposed to enshrouding them in academic jargon. She considers this a really important skill to have considering that many of us want to climb down the ivy tower that Columbia students often get stuck in, for the sake of helping people. Cassie is also a very positive and encouraging professor and always makes it a point to mark your abilities and groundbreaking thoughts when they present itself. She always takes a minute after class to tell you about how well you did on the individual presentation, which is really sweet. She is not traditional in her teaching style, often allowing students to explore different venues of expression in the final project for her seminars, whether it is an essay, video, podcast, etc. Also, Cassie is not the type of professor to force you to participate all the time or call on you. I always felt comfortable as someone who tends to listen more in class than speak, which is not always the case for some of my other classes.\nHer presence as a white professor in the ethnicity & race studies department can be somewhat questionable for a department that is primarily intended to comprise faculty of color for students of color, but her openness has put me (and hopefully others with the same concern) at ease. She is not pretentious or self-righteous in the least and is always open to discussing ideas that might challenge which she has to say.\nWorkload:\nVery reasonable for all of her classes. She is very open to extensions if necessary. Do not let her classes be a sources of stress for you, she does not want that. A very fair and holistic grader.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class was pretty good, but was disappointing to me in that it did not bring Anthropology to life for me as I was deciding whether or not to major in it.  Every class is spent by Professor Fennel beating into the students the argument of each reading for the day (which is light and very reasonable, by the way) with little room for interpretation or expansion into other interesting areas not covered into the readings.  I found it to be monotonous and not an engaging approach to anthropology - I didn't just want to learn every facet of the author's argument with little expansion on that as she sternly, yet considerately, as she really wanted us to learn, articulates what the author meant.\nThat being said, she is clearly a wonderful person and very committed to teaching.  If she fits into your schedule and you want to take this class, it's not a bad choice given the sincerity of the teaching and very reasonable workload.\nWorkload:\nOne article per class, take home midterm and final.  Very do-able! Even for first semester freshmen, I'd say.\n"

            "review_content": "\nFennell is such a good lecturer - all of these bad reviews are clearly outdated. She is full of energy, her lectures are extremely engaging, she thoroughly goes over the readings (many many many times...), telling you what points to understand, what is important etc. For concepts she even does demonstrations in class - uses students and TA's to demonstrate cultural differences and things of that sort. She seems to be strict on the first day or two, but it doesn't take long to realize she really wants everyone to do well and to understand the material. Take this class with her!\nthe class itself was amazing too - the concepts are very interesting, and the readings (though dry) are made very interesting when Fennell goes over them in class.\n\nWorkload:\nLight readings that were reasonable. we never even had to read a full book - only a few chapters. the midterm was take-home - 2 super short essays and she gives you 2-3 days. final was the same thing, just a little longer, and they ask you to be creative. for both take-home midterm and finals grading is fair. also there's one \"participant observation mini-ethnography\" you have to do. it's short (5 pages, and super easy to write. it's almost like a creative writing exercise)\n"

Do take this class with her, it's far easier than this class with the other profs. she is good at lecturing, though she talks a bit fast and can be repetitive. i think this is a good thing though, cuz you really get to know what's important. You don't need to do the readings since she summarizes them in class and they are also gone over in section. but they are all very interesting, so i recommend you read them. Fennell is intelligent and nice, she is thoroughly engaging too. take this class!\nWorkload:\ntake home midterm and final. 2 essays for each, and there is a strict word limit. readings are short and engaging, and you don't even have to do them, really, since you can read the material/find quotes when you are writing the essays anyway. \n"

            "review_content": "\nBefore taking the class, I had read some negative reviews and was prepared for a bad lecturer. However, I found Professor Fennell an interesting and engaging professor who really cared about her students. She made sure to learn all of our names (there were about 80 of us) and by the second week, could remember who we were and where we usually sat.\nHer lectures are a must. This class is not really about interpreting culture like I thought it was going to be. Instead, it is a survey of the most important anthropologists in the field (anthropology is only about 100 years old). There is a lot of reading involved and a lot of it, especially in the beginning and a few near the end, is very dense. Going to the lectures means she will tell you exactly what was said in the readings and what was meant by the author. That does not mean you do not have to read yourself because midterms and finals call for quotes from the readings (besides, not reading beforehand will just confuse you when she talks about these readings because they are not easy to understand). \nIf you choose a good TA, going to discussion sections are important too because TA's go over the readings again and for the really dense writers, this is important. It also is a chance to talk and discuss since in a full class, there isn't really a chance to share your opinions about the readings. \nWorkload:\nA lot of dense reading. A film response, a thick description in which you describe a scene somewhere for two hours, and a kinship diagram. Take home mid-term and final consisting several essay questions with strict word limits.\n"

            "review_content": "\nInterpretation of Culture on its own is not a bad class, but I would advise against taking it with Cassie Fennell. The material (via the readings) and the assignments (with the exception of the midterm \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0more on that later) were generally interesting and engaging and I learned a lot from them. In fact, those were the ONLY ways through which I learned anything from this class \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0I learned absolutely nothing from Cassie herself.\nLet me say that she is enthusiastic and clearly harbors aspirations of enriching young minds with the wisdom of the ethnographic method or whatever. I understand that she has good intentions. However, all of this is canceled out by her disorganization and sloppy lecturing. Cassie told us that our section, spring of 2011, was the first time she had taught Interpretation of Culture, and it definitely showed.\nFirst and foremost, Cassie is not a good lecturer. I would have stopped coming to class altogether if she hadn't told us at the beginning of the semester that she would take attendance and require a doctor's note if we were sick. I don't think anyone ever did give her a doctor's note and the lecture hall was very obviously less than full on any given day, but it seems absurd to me that she would have these expectations.\nBut I wouldn't have minded so much being absolutely required to be in lecture if it weren't for the fact that, a month or two into the semester, I realized that playing Angry Birds on my phone was a better use of time than listening to her. Cassie's lectures were disorganized and meandering and did very little to actually explicate the text we were reading. Half the time this is because she tries to \"engage the class\"; now, even aspiring to get 70+ people to feel like they are participating in a lecture  is admirable, but Cassie's attempts were poorly executed. For instance, when we were reading Mauss' essay about the societal regulation of bodies, Cassie made about ten people stand at the front of the lecture hall, close their eyes, and then sit on the floor at the count of three; then she made them each explain why they had chosen to sit in the position they had, and tried to use this as an example of how we all learn to sit properly in kindergarten and it sticks with us for the rest of our lives. That in itself is not a terribly difficult point to grasp, and she didn't need to waste twenty minutes of class having people explain why they sat cross-legged instead of another way. Another example of this was when we were reading Mintz' article about the sugar trade, and she started off her lecture by asking the class at large, \"What is the difference between me and a box of sugar?\" The idea she was trying to get at was that both the labor she performs and the sugar can be traded in markets, but we spent about ten minutes having people yell out stupid things like \"you have agency and the sugar doesn't!\" It was a useless exercise.\nAnother point I'd like to make about Cassie's lectures was that they were riddled with little inaccuracies. Not inaccuracies about the material itself, but inaccuracies in her speech. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean to be petty here, but when Cassie wants to talk about synecdoche but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spell it properly on the board and doesn't know how to pronounce it, I become exasperated. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to accuse her of being of inferior learnedness or intelligence, but when she inexplicably pronounces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seafaring argonauts\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153see-far-ing air-oh-nots\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 one wonders.\nAnd now, onto the infamous midterm. Cassie told us that she decided to make it a take-home midterm so it would be \"less stressful\" than having to take an in-class one, but this ended up having the opposite effect. The midterm was posted online at 9AM on a Tuesday and we were to hand it in by 5PM on Wednesday, the next day. It consisted of four 500-word essay questions; she told us beforehand that it would take us about five hours. 32 hours to complete a five-hour midterm is a RIDICULOUSLY short amount of time. Not only that, but each of the questions had so many embedded questions within them that they each could have easily been the topic of a 2000-word paper, so cramming an answer into 500 words was a daunting task. Overall, I spent about TEN HOURS finishing the midterm. Ten out of 32 hours to do a midterm is far, far too long.\nHOWEVER, though the bad things about Interpretation of Culture with Cassie were numerous, as explained above, there were things that made the class as a whole not a complete disaster. For instance, though our final exam was originally supposed to have a format similar to the midterm, Cassie changed it so that we had a week and a half to complete it instead of 32 hours, presumably after hearing back from students \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and the final was manageable and doable. Our assignments, besides the midterm, consisted of a short response to a documentary, a five- to six-page \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thick description\u00e2\u20ac\u009d observational fieldwork assignment, and a three- to four-page essay on kinship diagrams, all of which were quite interesting as Cassie gave us a lot of freedom with them. It was mysterious to me why Cassie could come up with such interesting assignments but then torture us with bad midterms and lectures.\nIN CONCLUSION:\nCassie Fennell is a nice person. However, though I knew that this semester was the first time she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d taught Interpretation of Culture, I was surprised when I found out that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been teaching at Columbia for a few years now because she has the air and competence of a completely inexperienced professor. Everything I learned in this class I learned from the readings becuase lectures were useless, and though that worked out fine in terms of getting a good grade, it would have been nicer to have a professor who actually taught me things.\nWorkload:\nWORKLOAD:\nReadings for each class that can be skimmed. Weekly hourlong discussion section and posting a discussion question on Courseworks the night before (but you only have to go to 8 out of 12 of them). Three assignments over the course of the semester which she gives you a lot of freedom with. We had a ridiculously long and painful take-home midterm BUT I expect she will change it to be not as long in future years. The final was also take-home but much more manageable than the midterm.\n"

You will definitely learn a lot if you take this class, and it is especially helpful if you are interested in studying the humanities. Professor Fennell took the time to learn more of our names (there are around 70 people in the class), which is a first I have seen for any professor with a class that size. \nWorkload:\nWeekly reading (not an unmanageable amount), one short assignment (1.5 pages) and 2 longer assignments (4 pages). The assignments are fun, such as conducting an observation of some cultural activity and describing it. Midterm is really difficult, and is not graded easily.

The midterm was in-class and it was all essay format. She gives you feedback on your midterm to help you better understand the concepts and fill in the gaps between your response and what she was looking for. There are also in-class presentations; she gives everyone the syllabus and tells everyone to pick which week they want to present the material and facilitate class discussion which is excellent in allowing you to practice presenting and facilitating discussion. It's also very helpful in engaging the material. The final is take home and like the midterm, is deceivingly simple. You take away a great deal of knowledge from the course, but be warned that it is veeeeeery difficult to get an A in this class.\nWorkload:\nCRAZY!!! \n"
