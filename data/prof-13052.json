            "review_content": "\nWhile I personally did not appreciate the general concept of Frontiers of Science as a class, Eric made the discussion portion bearable and even interesting at times. Eric usually plans lessons that are directly related to the lecture material, and prepares PowerPoints to present the information. We often worked in small groups to complete small activities/worksheets related to the class material. I appreciated that Eric was clearly passionate about the course material, very approachable and available for office hours, and fairly flexible in terms of handing in late work (for the weekly homework assignments).\nWorkload:\n- weekly homework assignments: pretty easy, tediously long at times (especially if you don't enjoy Frontiers in Science in general) but certainly never too difficult conceptually to complete\n- midterm and final exams: very manageable as long as you take some time to study - don't blow it off just because you are allowed cheat sheets on the exams! the exams don't really test your ability to memorize and regurgitate information so the cheat sheets won't actually help that much; the exams are meant to test the \"Scientific Habits of Mind,\" general tools that help you understand and interpret scientific information --> in other words, it's more about the scientific skills you gain than the content you learn\n- term paper: the more effort you put into this, the higher your grade will be; it was nice that Eric gave us benchmarks (First Drafreview_contentr review_content, Final Draft) so that we weren't scrambling at the end before finals to turn something in; in general, not a monumental effort\n"
