            "review_content": "\nSo here's the break down as I see it. Zafir pretty funny and decent lecturer a little haphazard.  Jessica a soulless robot of a woman who kept awkwardly chatting up this one kid in the front of the class during lecture. Stuart was either non existent or hilarious and useless when he did lecture. Overall I was very disappointed in what could have been a very interesting course. I'm an engineer and so the first part of the course which is a little mathier than most bio/neuroscience/pre-med kids like was pretty easy, but the what should've been the most interesting parts of the course (the latter 2/3) were taught so poorly it was hard to enjoy it. \nSo, basically the most mediocrely mediocre course for a very interesting field of study. \nWorkload:\nNot that bad really for the midterms. The final was choose 2 sets from a 3 paper set, a 1 paper set, and another 3 paper set. The key is to know all the basic details of the experimental methods (what the model system was, why they used it, what methods did they use, etc.) And being able to tie those methods in with the results and basically recreate a fairly detailed outline of what was done in the experiment.\n"
