One take-home, multiple-choice online midterm (we had 5 days to do it), the same deal for the final exam.  One paper on 5 pieces of music-100 words or less one each piece.  Also offered extra credit and spent time on the intersection of dance and music towards the end.  A good pianist, too.\nWorkload:\nLight.\n"
