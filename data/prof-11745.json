            "review_content": "\nProfessor Borer is one of the most kind and understanding professors I have met at Columbia. Our class was a 10:10 and naturally many students were late, tired, and more but she never raised her voice, or made a negative comment once. Although her calm nature does sometimes cause the class to become boring, her approachable manner, and smile make up for a great start of the day! \nThe class is usually around 10 people, almost always has 2 people conversations that last for 20 mins where professor Borer walks around and listens. We watched movies in class, and read and watched theaters that add a French culture that I personally found very useful for my following semester in Paris. Professor Borer is very understanding of comments, suggestions and even criticism of French arts, which makes it very easy to talk in class, and you should talk! \nAlthough the participation looks like 'only' 25%, trust me, it is worth 99%. The class really moves through student participation and if you just stay in your corner thinking about when you'll make it to bed again, you will probably not get a good grade. \nThe class is also for those who are more into the composition part of french. Though we technically had one class on grammar and one on composition each week, the readings (poems, essays, theaters by Moliere etc) and movies (Jules et Jim) are much more focused on. \nHomework is like any other language course, very regular, but you can miss doing one or two. She rarely collects them, she will tell you when she does. It will take time, depending on your french level, not more than any kind of elementary language course (2 hours per week or so)\n\nPro tip: don't buy the books, we barely used them, they're not worth it! \nWorkload:\n4 quizes (20%) , 1 final and 1 midterm (25%), 4 compositions (30%), participation (25%) \n"

She was fantastic at integrating the entire class into exercises with vocabulary and pronunciation, gave us the freedom to explore various linguistic and cultural differences (we once spent half a class talking about French curse words), and when we were writing all of our professor reviews we all struggled to think of anything she could improve on. Tr\u00c3\u00a8s bien!\nWorkload:\nAverage, optional workbook exercises and weekly quizzes/bi-weekly compositions. Four examens pour semestre. \n"
