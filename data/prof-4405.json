As a serious student of Korean, I've come to her office hours to get more tutoring and she has put every effort into helping me and any others who would seek extra help. With so many classes language teachers much teach, I appreciate that kind of dedication. In addition, while language learning can be repetitious, Professor Won always tries to make class time as entertaining as possible (obviously within constraints), including anecdotes and funny jokes that relate to the lesson plan at-hand. She also explained grammar patterns in a way that was easily digestible. I would recommend any class she teaches without reservation. \nWorkload:\nMedium\n"
