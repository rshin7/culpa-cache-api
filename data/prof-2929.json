            "review_content": "\nDodd's class is definitely a decent amount of work and fairly challenging material, but his class is more than fair and he is a great teacher and a great human. He is more than willing to help, and his lectures are engaging, well-organized, interesting, and Dodd's pretty funny, too. Plenty of demonstrations to keep things interesting, and he responds well to feedback from the class on what they'd like to see in the class or how they'd like things to change.\nReally, my classes with Jeremy Dodd (Physics 1601/1602) have been my best academic experiences so far at Columbia - I've learned a lot, and although it's a lot of work, it certainly felt worthwhile.\nWorkload:\nWeekly online psets (10 questions), 2 online pre-class questions per class, 2 midterms, final\n"

To clarify, I am an engineering student who has to take an annoying natural science course to fulfill my track. Being said, I am not a physics person.\nProfessor Dodd is, as mentioned in all comments, warm, helpful, approachable. It was a pity that I didn't take much use of his office hour, but I am sure it would be of great help to everyone. \nProfessor Dodd assigns homework through Wiley Plus web assign, which is exactly the same thing as the textbook exercise. However, there was a time that he assigned several non-textbook problems which required some derivation. Not that intimidating at all.\nJeremy also posts literally ALL the helpful stuff on coursework's. Don't forget to take full advantage of them.\nOur TA was Zac. I barely went to his recitations though I think they would be helpful if you need someone guide you through textbook exercises. Honestly, I really preferred solving them by myself.\nThe midterms and the finals are pretty reasonable in difficulties. If you solve all the problems he assigns, well at least that's what I did, you will probably get a grade better than your expectation. \nDO take Professor Dodd's class! It's painless, clearly structured and, better than most physics classes in high school, won't make this subject intimidating for a non-physics-major student like me.\n\nWorkload:\n8 PSets, 10 problems/ assignment,  2-3 hrs per week.\n2 midterms (first one almost everyone got around 100%, second one mean=60%)\n1 final\n"

            "review_content": "\nFirst off, I'll give my background in physics because that seems to matter quite a lot when reviewing 1600.  In high school, I took a basic algebra-based physics class freshman year where we essentially learned what acceleration was... then junior year I took AP Physics C Mechanics, got a 5, felt VERY comfortable with the material, and then senior year took AP E&M;, had a teacher that didn't teach, got a 2, didn't learn much.\nOk, so going into physics freshman year as someone who liked it a little, but really wasn't sure about majoring in it or anything like that, Dodd was a wonderful instructor who really changed how I looked at physics.  He taught every class enthusiastically, faulty demonstrations and all, and really focused on kids learning an intuition for what was going on.  Dodd helped me learn that Physics was more than just a science class that I was good at, but instead was really a fundamental method for looking at how the world works and why.  The first semester felt a little easy for me due to learning Mechanics in high school, but I was somewhat dreading the second semester, because I thought I hated E&M; and had no intuition for it.  However, Dodd gave me a totally new perspective.   He taught it so thoroughly and so well that it became something entirely different for me, and was one of my absolute favorite classes.\nNow, aside from me fanboy-ing Dodd, he really did have some amazingly helpful aspects of the course.\n1. The textbook he chose is the best textbook for any subject that I've ever read.  It was such a nice tool to have an easy-to-read, yet thorough exploration of the material to back up on if you missed a class or two.\n2. Mastering Physics, which was our version of WebAssign, worked very well for me, making problem sets fun, challenging, and very educational.  Also, the second semester, he added practice Psets that were perfect ways to study before the midterms, and before the final, he posted adaptive Psets, which were very helpful.\n3. Dodd really took advantage of Courseworks.  He posts all the information you could ever need about the course on the home page.  He posts his lecture notes weekly. He posts before each midterm and final the formula sheet used on the exam, the material covered on the exam, the previous year's version of that exam, a solution guide to the previous year's exam, and seating assignments.  And after each exam, he posts the score distribution, the exam itself, and the solutions.  Really everything you could ask for.\n4. All of his exams (ignoring the debacle of the first midterm of the Fall, on which most of the class got a 100%) are fair and well made.\n5. He frequently sends out mini announcements via email, and he is very responsive to emails and after-class chats.\n6. Finally, his office hours were a pleasure to go to.  He is inviting, warm, and helpful, making office hours, in some ways, the best part of the class.\nTo really understand how much Dodd cares for his students, I'll share an anecdote:\nOn the last day of lecture, Dodd brought in a big bouquet of white roses and, saying that it felt like a quasi-graduation, he gave one to every student (at least those who showed up to lecture that day) because of how much he loved teaching us this year.\nDodd is really a special teacher, and he made it clear to me that physics is going to be an important part of my education, convincing me to at least concentrate in it.  I give him the highest recommendation to all.\nWorkload:\nWeekly online Psets that took around 3-6 hours.  Two fair but challenging midterms, and a final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nSince most of the other reviews are from people who aced AP Physics C and took this class, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say right off that my perspective is different. I did not take AP Physics, or even E&M; physics in high school really. Coming into this class all I knew was V=IR.\nI took Dodd because I figured I could drop down if I needed from 1601 into 1401 and I probably should have because everyone in 1601 knew more than me coming in, but I stubbornly stuck with it until Christmas and then, hearing that 1602 would be a more level playing field, I decided to stick with in for semester two.\nOn paper, Dodd doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like the best professor, and if I were to describe what about his teaching style worked I would not be able to. He gives weekly 10-problem PSets (on masteringphysics.com), and asks you to read the book. I read the book but not in sync with the course (all at the beginning and end of the semester). I went to most lectures and feel that I got a lot out of them, I think that this is why I did better than most people, many of whom did not show up for his 10am class. I also went to recitations and felt that they were very productive (again most people forego this. bad idea). My TA Zac was amazing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not exactly an easy class, but I feel like it could have been more rigorous. However, I do feel like I understand electricity and magnetism after this class. I like physics because of his class. \nThe reasons that I stuck with the class is that Dodd is truly the nicest professor I have had at Columbia. He is humble and cares about the well being of his students. He will remember your name if you introduce yourself to him. He will make time to meet with you outside of office hours if you want. Definitely go to his lunch with a professor if you can, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a charming man. \nGiven the opportunity, I would take the class again.\nWorkload:\nFirst 2.5 weeks thermodynamics, this is easy if you took accelerated chem semester one as I did, if not, better get ready to learn kinetic molecular theory in depth from the book as I felt that Dodd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in class explanation was lacking, in his defense, its not really on the final and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to know it in that much depth for the physics that we do.\nNext 5 weeks, electricity. This was easy and Dodd explained it very well. Understand Guass\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 law and you understand everything. This in concept even applies to the next 5 weeks of magnetism.\nFinal 5 weeks: Magnetism, this is harder conceptually but the math is mostly the same as for electricity. The last few classes Dodd talks about bigger things such as EM waves, which is a nice capstone to the course. \nI studied for 3 days for the final. That was crucial to my success, but if you know this stuff already you will probably do fine.\n2 midterms, Weekly PSets, final, read (you should, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t and regretted it, most of the PSets are from similar problems in the chapter)\nGrade is from one of two algorithms: \n20% each midterm, Hw 20% and 40% final\nor\n25% higher ranking midterm, 25% Psets, 50% Final\nCourse Grading: your final course grade is complied from the above and then curved as such: top 40% get an A-range grade (divided into thirds for the actual grade), next 40% get B-range. Bottom 20% get Cs, Ds, Fs\nMidterms are generally simpler than PSet problems, but time is short. Final is cumulative.\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nColumbia lacks a good physics class for students who don't want the rigor of 2800, yet have done physics at a level equal to or above AP Physics C (1600). 1602 is more or less a rehash of AP Physics C: E&M.; I took 2801 first semester and dropped down to 1602 for the second semester because 2800 took too much of my time (I have come to regret this decision).\nFor those who don't have much physics exposure, go for 1400. Dodd rushes through Thermodynamics and E&M; at a furious pace, giving students no time to digest the material. If you took this class, and this was the first time you were learning the material, I pity you. It's impossible to actually learn anything from Dodd at the speed at which eh teaches.\nDodd is a friendly, approachable teacher who does a lot of fun demonstrations. He assigns homework which is harder than material covered in class. Exams tend to be easier than the problem sets.\nThis class is meant for students who have taken AP Physics C or the equivalent, and want a physics sequence they don't want to study for. I suggest taking 2800 if you want to actually learn real physics (be warned that 2800 is indeed a hard class) and 1400 if you don't know physics.\nWorkload:\n20% weekly problem set (some questions are slightly tricky - almost like the 2800 problems)\n30% from one of two midterms (lowest dropped)\n50% final\n"

            "review_content": "\nDodd\nThe previous reviews point out many things about Dodd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s class that I can agree with. The problem sets tend to be harder than the samples in lecture, and occasionally contain unsolvable problems that he ends up throwing out. The tests also only have 4 questions each, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unprepared you can lose points rather quickly. \nHere, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll diverge a bit from the reviews to provide a different perspective for students  who:\na)\tReally like physics\nb)\tHave taken physics C:Mechanics and E+M and received 5s\nc)\tFelt extremely comfortable with the material covered in above courses\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re deciding between the 1600 series and 2800 series, this will probably apply to you. Depending on the strength of your high school\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s physics program, you may find that this class is a repeat of physics C. Even with a good physics C background however, you will find a few of the problems challenging and unique. In this case, lecture attendance may not be as necessary on topics you feel great about. On topics that you want to learn more about\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlike rotation\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust show up and pay attention. If you take 1601, you will most likely do well (B+,A-,A) without an intense amount of effort beyond the required work. TA sections are a joke and are generally unhelpful.\nAs many of the people in the class are being exposed to new material / new depth of old material, you will have a bit of an advantage. Taking this class is a good idea if you want to keep your physics sharp but also work on fundamentals. However, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to challenge yourself and learn more in depth, try  2801\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to drop down to 1601 and your grade is adjusted for the difficulty difference. \n\nWorkload:\n2-5 hour Weekly PSets\n2 Midterms, drop 1 (1st one was easy, median score 100%; second was more tricky,many people blew it off)\n1 Final (Long, medium-tricky difficulty)\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Dodd overall is a nice guy who genuinely cares about students and has truly good intentions. Nevertheless, there are sadly some negative aspects to this class that have made me hesitant to take a second semester with him.\n First off, Dodd does try to liven up the class with demonstrations. He did the conservation of rotational inertia problem which was funny as he got smacked in the face with dumbbells and the student with the dumbbells subsequently fell of the spinning stool. He always tried to incorporate some demonstration to make the class fun. Alas, a 10: 10 am class for me was, at the very least, way too early and I truly found it difficult to attend and fully pay attention every single time. He goes over the class well, but sadly far too simplistically. The only appropriate metaphor I can find to compare his class would be to be in kindergarten learning 2+2 and simple arithmetic in class and then having to do complex multivariable integration for homework. Dodd sadly goes over the easiest, clearest, and simplest problems and leaves the hardest, most confusing, and poorly written problems in the textbook. The tools given in class were far too insufficient for allowing students to answer the problems, and sadly I would do worse than the average on the problem sets as I actually tried to do the problems fairly and without answers most of the time while everyone else probably copied answers off the solutions manual. Why not just assign some problems of a moderate difficulty, and not have to rape my brain? \nThe worst part of this class was the textbook. IT IS ABYSMAL. Sadly there are so many great textbooks available for physics and an elite private university such as Columbia has to assign the worst piece of crap on the face of the earth, Fishbane. Reading through chapters of Fishbane is akin to reading some poorly written, unclear, simplified, and confusing book and then being given insanely difficult problems at the end of the textbook which you were not given any tools from the book on how to solve these problems. It's truly the worst.\nThis course may be good for students truly talented in Physics, but for me, even hard work and dedication and showing up to class as much as I could proved insufficient to do his homeworks, understand the material clearly, and do easily on his midterms/ final. \nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets with terribly difficult problems that can take between 3-8 hours to complete. The first midterm was extremely easy, but sadly, the average was a 53/60, and I got a 50/60, which to his grading curve equated to a harsh B-??? Little stupid errors led to me being probably around an A- to being at a B-. The second midterm was probably the most frightening experience at Columbia, as I could barely half the midterm, yet surprisingly I got the median and this was equal to a B+ (higher than the first midterm?????). The final was very hard actually, some of the problems were far too unclear and ridiculous (something about a girl swinging on a pendulum attached to spinning pole and finding the period of that, something about a rocket exploding in the air into two pieces that led me to make the false assumption that the kinetic energy would be proportional to the weight of the two pieces, and something insane about a bunch of stupid fluid columns). I actually got several points below the average, and am quite nervous to see my grade...\n"

            "review_content": "\nI'll generally recommend taking 1601 over 1401 because they aren't much different in terms of workload and I like Dodd. That being said, 1401 does seem like LESS work (something greatly appreciated as a first year), and unless you genuniely like physics (like me!) you might not appreciate an awesome professor and a delve into more a bit more theoretical material than 1401 exposes you to. \nDodd explains the math way too fast, and I am lost often in lectures unless I am really doing my best to pay attention/get the material and not sleepy. Sometimes he recommends you read the book before going to class; disregard this advice, the book sucks. He explains the concepts rather well, and if you take notes during class, you can go back later and understand the specifics behind the math. I highly recommend going lectures. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I have spent over 4 hours going through a chapter in the textbook trying to learn it on my own. Once I skipped about 3 weeks worth of lectures one month, bringing me behind to the point where I never caught up until the morning of the final. Go to the lectures, then attempt the pset, referring back to the book when you need help. Even if you don't understand everything in the lecture, just exposing yourself to it and taking notes is waaaaaay better than attempting to understand the material on your own. The first week or so of the class is easy and doesn't really require attending lecture. This is decieving, as the class quickly picks up and screws you over if you skip lecture.\nDodd incorporates some funny demostrations into his lecture, some of which conclude with him getting smacked in the head with dumbells; videotape these. He is also rather British and has a nice sense of humor. Additionally, he arranges dinners with the \"faculty/student interaction dinner\" program so a group of about 20 students can eat food with him, discuss the class, and other topics of life. His office hours are very helpful and he will go over problems that are on the pset. It is very funny to see him try to get everyone out of his office when its 5 o clock. A student will be trying to ask a few last questions, to which his response will be \"I'm confident that if you use your intuition, you will come to the solution\" when the student clearly doesn't understand the problem. Again, make use of the time he does offer for office hours. Many times I would have questions for him after class, and a line would form. He always took the time to answer everyone's questions and concerns without trying to brush anything off (though he wasn't too excited about people switching down to 1401). Plus he really enjoyed explaining the specifics behind his demonstrations.\nEveryone skips recitation. When I would attend, I wouldn't go to the TA I was assigned to. There is no attendance/quizzes in recitation, so I recommend trying a session on each day and attending the one you like better regardless of which time slot you are signed up for. Very helpful if you take advantage of it, especially since most people are skipping it.\nDodd really cares about his students and gives you all the resources needed to succeed in his class. (you just have to take advantage of them!) You will come out of the class knowing tons about mechanics; I can't open a door or go to a bowling alley without thinking of the corresponding physics formula. He is the director of undergraduate studies for the physics department, so he is really good to know if you want to major in physics. He also held review sessions before the final which were really helpful. The psets will kick your ass, but you'll survive if as long as you don't get behind!\nWorkload:\n1 pset due every week. Takes about 4-6 hours. Sometimes the problems are literally impossible to solve and the methods to solved them aren't explained in book or lecture. That being said, attempting the pset ahead of time (me never) and asking questions during office hours/recitations will prove very helpful. Do as he recommends and collaborate with friends on the psets, but don't cheat.\n2 midterms. The first midterm was easy (show ALL of your work, I got screwed out of 8 points because I did some of the calculations in my head), the second one was impossible, and the final was about the right difficulty. He drops the lowest pset and the lowest midterm (aka the second one). Thank god. Psets are graded quite fairly.\n"

He did not prepare any practice exams because he \"had not taught the course\" before.\nWorkload:\nDodd doesn't seem to know which problem sets are the hard ones, but none of them take more than 3-4 hours.

            "review_content": "\nGive this man a silver nugget at the very least! Dodd is an exceptionally gifted and caring teacher. He really cares more about how much you learn over dry scores as evidenced by his grading scheme: only your highest midterm counts. He's also very engaging during office hours and will take the time to walk you through any HW problem, concept or random physics tangent you may be interested in. Dodd is extremely clear during lectures and noticeably takes the effort to explain concepts as simply and comprehensively as possible. \nCompared to the other \"big name\" professors in the physics department, Dodd really reminded me of a high school type of teacher. He goes out of his way to get to know you during office hours if you attend, learns your name etc. I feel most people who reviewed Dodd in the past were in either the 1200 or 1400 sequence and had very little exposure to how horrendous math/science professors can be at research universities. I was in 2801 and honors math A first semester and the difference in teaching ability between those professors and Dodd is ridiculous. \nHomeworks are a perfect balance of rigor and accessibility. There's generally a problem or two that makes you think but overall the problem sets (of 10 problems or so) are very doable and if you pay attention in class shouldn't take longer than 3-5 hours. The midterms and final are distinctly easier than the homeworks, and as I said before the lower midterm is dropped. Dodd also has extensive office hours on top of multiple recitations before the HWs are due so there's really no reason you shouldn't have a near perfect homework average. On top of that, he curves to an A-. Frankly this class is set up so you can succeed. The best part is if you care enough to take notes during lecture, actually do the homeworks and attend office hours/recitations as needed, you will learn a lot of interesting physics. I highly recommend the 1600 sequence over the 2800 sequence for students who want a SOLID foundation in physics rather than acceleration for the sake of it. \nWorkload:\nFairly average for an intro science course. Weekly problem sets from the textbook of 10 problems that takes 3-5 hours. Two midterms, but only the highest counts and a final.\n"

Homework problems are of much greater difficulty; I really wished that he challenged us more in class with the example problems. Most of the time, you will be left doing your problem set well into the night and suddenly discover that the problem makes no sense and is not related to any other problems that you have done before. Make sure to work in groups, so that you can help each other out.\nHowever, he is very willing to help anyone with concepts and will take time outside of office hours if needed. \nThat being said, his grading system is a little weird. It is two tiered:\n1) 1st midterm 20%, 2nd midterm 20%, final 40%, homework 20%\nor\n2) Better midterm, homework, and final (He doesn't list out these percentages anymore; maybe because of me.)\nSo which ever gives you the highest grade will be your grade in the class. His TAs or whoever grades the midterms and finals make A LOT of mistakes(If you were grading 150+ exams under time pressure, you would make mistakes too), so make sure never to pass up the opportunity to get a regrade. Even if you are unsure about it, just go to office hours and ask him about the problem. Then submit your midterm/final for regrade. I know from personal experience what a missed opportunity this regrading means. I really commend the physics department for this department-wide policy (unlike the Chemistry department, in which professors decide when to show tests and when to let regrades. i.e. placement test).\nWorkload:\nOne problem set per week, usually covering one and a half chapters, sometimes more. He usually does not give homework after a midterm (awesomeness). You should work in groups, as inevitably you will discover one or two weird problems. \nRecitations are interesting because when the semester starts out, the TA tries to \"teach\" you the problem, but most people know that the process to finding the answer is as important as finding out the answer. That is why its called comparing answers. Anyways, aside from that digression, the TA eventually just runs through the problem stopping just short of the answer, but usually also giving the answer.\nMidterms - My advice is that if you don't want to or can't spend the time to get A's on both Midterms, you better study your butt off for one of them and get an A on it. Then you can drop the second one, no matter how badly you did (i.e. F). It's better to an A and an F on the two midterms than a B+ and a B.\nFinal - same level as midterms, sometimes easier. Make sure you do all the practice midterms and finals to prepare. They are really around the same level of difficulty. \n"

That said, going to class is probably optional since the textbook does a good job of explaining the same concepts too. \nIf you have a grading problem on your midterm, it's a pain because you have to submit a form and then wait who knows how long before they tell you if your mark went up (or down). Annoying process, so I usually try to send him a quick email asking if I should bother getting it regraded.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem set. Fairly straightforward. Collected and graded (usually only grades a couple questions). The median on the homework is usually perfect so...\nTwo midterms, one final. 3 questions on each midterm, so know your stuff. But the homework covers the exact same type of question on the midterm so it shouldn't be a problem.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf Dodd has changed a lot since the culpa reviews were submitted for PHYS 1401. He's a lot less passionate about E&M;, and it shows. His lectures are rarely useful and he tends to go around a point before actually making it, which makes me extremely impatient. His timing is awful; he always goes past class time and doesn't cover everything that's on the final. I would recommend taking Hughes instead of Dodd.\nAt least he gave us refracting glasses on the last day!\nWorkload:\nAs long as you have Cramster, you can't go wrong on the homeworks. Only a few questions are graded on each homework so if you happen to mess up one that's graded you're screwed. There's 2 midterms and one of them is dropped. The final was absolutely awful but I'm guessing the curve will be good.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Dodd is one of the best lecturers at Columbia. He has a good sense of humor which he mixes in with the dry material in order to make lecture enjoyable. However, he has a tendency to make the material seem MUCH easier than it actually is. He often (if not always) overgeneralizes ideas and he does very simple examples in class. When one looks at the homework, however, it is a totally different story. I often found myself clueless over most of the problems in the book even after attending lecture. In order to even come close to doing the problems, I had to read the chapter and follow along with the example problems in the book. I also had to often turn to online help.\nI think Prof. Dodd does a very good job of presenting the material in the time allotted, and in order to do well in the class, one has to put in a lot of work outside of class.\nWorkload:\nOne problem set a week, usually 8-12 hard problems and can take anywhere from 3 to 8 hours. Two very hard midterms, but he curves it generously so the median becomes a B+. To give you an idea, the median on both midterms was around 60-65%. Very hard final, I felt more prepared for the final than I did for either of the midterms and I was still lost, and left about 1/3 of it blank.\n"

            "review_content": "\nDodd is a very engaging lecturer and makes the principles he's discussing relevant using examples and many demonstrations. Some of these work better than others but they are always interesting. \nHis lectures can sometimes seem like he is reading the book out loud but it is better to go and follow along than to try to decipher his lecture notes after class - they won't make a lot of sense. He covers a lot of material in 75 minutes, averaging a chapter per class. Reading the chapter before class will help you understand the lecture, rather than struggling to grasp the concepts for the first time as he zips through them.\nProblem sets are time-consuming, especially if you haven't read the textbook. Try to find people to work with and definitely attend the  discussion sections, where the TA goes over selected questions.\nMidterms and finals are difficult, requiring actual thought. The questions are often slightly-reworked version of the harder questions in the textbook, so make sure to practice them. You'll do better spending your time working out those problems than re-reading your notes and the text over and over again, unless you're totally lost. \nWorkload:\nFairly heavy. He covers the material quickly and weekly problem sets can include material from several chapters, which you'll have to read if you don't want to waste time struggling with the problems. You'll also want to spend time doing practice problems and going over his sample tests before midterm/final exams.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Dodd is my favorite teacher I have had at Columbia to date.  Just to give you an idea of my perspective, I am a post-bacc premed.  Professor Dodd had a great lecture style - while teaching rather dry material, his sense of humor and lovely accent make the material easier to swallow.  He explained concepts simply and clearly.  I would agree that his examples in class were a little too simple to be helpful at times.  However, he was available to students during office hours and after class and was more than willing to go over difficult problems.  He also talked a little about his own research and other current happenings in physics that were very interesting and at times applicable (without going overboard... I didnt feel like he was wasting class time or anything).\nWorkload:\nProblem sets took me between 2 and 8 hours.  Professor Dodd did poll the class and lessened workloads a few times.  Although the workload was at times heavy (mostly in the beginning of the semester), I felt the homework taught me and prepared me for exams very well.\n"

His assignments are difficult but he will poll the class and make adjustments.  His first midterm was challenging but fair, while his second midterm was easier.  You will be relatively successful in his class if you understand the homework problems completely, and review the difficult problems in the book.  Professor Dodd gave a very fair curve, with a B+ as the mean.  I really enjoyed this physics class although I started slacking towards the end.  Sometimes the problems Dodd goes over in class are too simple or he generalizes it.  His demonstrations are an absolute riot!!\nWorkload:\nVery reasonable workload.  The final exam was hell.  Cumulative and difficult.  Some of the problems weren't expected.\n"
