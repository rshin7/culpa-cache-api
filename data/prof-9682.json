She makes the class a lot of fun and the material studied interesting and memorable. Although learning all the dates and names of the works can be a pain in the neck, especially for the final, the stuff is very interesting and, besides, I believe, she makes a pretty good curve for both of the exams. Just attend the class, do your work, ask questions if you have them, and you will do great!!\nWorkload:\n2 exams, 3 papers.\n"
