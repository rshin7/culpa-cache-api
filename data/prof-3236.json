            "review_content": "\nGuy is a fantastic TA.  In fact, he'd make a great professor as well.  When it comes to political science, he definitely knows his stuff.  His discussion sections were actually helpful and far from a waste of time, as some discussion sections sadly are.  In the first two or three sections he helped us with how to analyze the fairly dense political science readings and how to present coherent and persuasive arguments while we reviewed the readings.  He also helped build connections between the readings and all the topics.  Guy also made himself very accessible, and he is definitely a wealth of information you will not want to pass up!\nWorkload:\nWeekly discussion section attendance taken!  The course itself was reading intensive and also required two take home midterm essays (about 4 pages double-spaced each) and final research design.  We also had four in-class exams on readings that we were forewarned about.\n"
