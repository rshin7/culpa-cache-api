            "review_content": "\nGreat French teacher. Incredibly patient and nice. Has authentic French accent, unlike some of the other grad students teaching beginner and intermediate French. Highly recommended.\nShe comes to class prepared and knows her stuff. Always open to extra office hours outside of regular time. Probably one of the best French teachers for the beginner/intermediate level. Not sure if she teaches advanced classes. She is stringent on attendance and handing in assignments on time, somewhat more stringent than other grad students I have had.\nWorkload:\nStandard french class work load. not too bad.\n"
