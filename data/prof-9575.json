On top of that I thought she was a pretty fair grader and she was definitely approachable. I ended up with an A- in the class and I don't even enjoy writing.\nThe one thing that did annoy me was that she didn't really give critical feedback on each progression. Once, I switched my intro and my conclusion and she didn't even notice. \nAlso, it wasn't a themed section so she got to pick the topic. She chose plagiarism (which was interesting to me), but some people really hated it. By the 3rd essay she shifted to intellectual property so that was pretty cool.\nWorkload:\nThe usual 4 progressions and tedious rewrites. She also assigns mini writing assignments before class, but nothing too bad.\n"
