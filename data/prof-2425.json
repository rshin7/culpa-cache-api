You will not learn much in the way of actual drawing technique in this class...it's really more of a workshop.  Also, about 90% of class time was spent on figure drawing from a nude model.  As the previous reviewer said, John will probably never criticize your work, no matter what you show up with.  I thought the assignments he gave us were really great though..always very creative and interesting, never straight-forward. The two classes we spent going to galleries in Chelsea were also really fun...John in an artist himself and knows everything about the contemporary art scene.\nWorkload:\nWeekly drawing assignments.  A nice break from all your other classes.\n"

Hes very opened minded about the work, I could have walked in with a cup and made it my homework if I explained the reason behind it well enough. I had fun in the class because I like to draw, but if your looking for someone to really work you through drawing technique hell only take you 25% of the way. The class is what you make of it. BUT HES COOL. Take it. \nWorkload:\nLike I said, I could have drawn a circle on a page and given an explanation and he would have allowed it. Not a problem\n"
