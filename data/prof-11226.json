            "review_content": "\nNick doesn't seem to have an agenda in mind when teaching and comments about artists seem to be related but not really important.\nI know this is part of the core, and a mandatory class, but I would have like to see something more substantial added by the professor.\nI do not feel I've learned the least about art history despite this class. Lectures are always tangential and do not add much beyond what the average viewer can see. \nThere isn't a sense of coherence of building upon previous history in most of the classes. \nI'm not really sure I left this class with more than I had going in.\nThen again, if you are looking for a mind numbing class that doesn't take a shitload of work to do well (you will have to read at least some articles for a paper) and doesn't require memorizing artwork or dates - maybe Nick is for you.\nWorkload:\nNick began the semester telling us that he too was a student and understood our work demands. Yet he would assign 100+ pages of reading per class. (That being said I certainly got more from the grueling readings than I ever did in class.)\n"
