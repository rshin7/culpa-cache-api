Take this class with him if you can.\nWorkload:\nVery reasonable.  A few writing assignments, 1 paper (5 pages), 1 midterm, 1 final, both easy.\n"

This was sweet, as I hear that some classes spend forever on the baroque period.  His perpetual discomfort with the temperature of the room (he likes to open and close windows many times per class) and sense of humor were endearing.  He brought a lot of interesting theory into class, yet did so in a way which was accessible even  if you hadn't read the original texts (and it seemed most people hadn't).   The discussions these ideas generated were suprisingly lucid for a class of people forced to taked the course.  I sort of expected to hate Music Hum, but ended up never wanting to skip class and I've even sought out some of the music we covered to listen to... Just For Fun!  (no!!)  Josh is super young and a little scattered, but an excellent teacher with an infectious enthusiasm for the material.  \nWorkload:\nreading (you can get away with doing almost none of it), midterm (question handed out in advance), concert report on a shitty opera, take-home final with in-class listening ID portion.  with any sort of effort you should get an A.\n"
