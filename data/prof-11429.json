            "review_content": "\nProfessor Stephens is a fine professor. I had her for African Civilizations, a seminar Core requirement. She is straightforward, fair, and unassuming. She isn't going to knock your socks off, but she definitely knows her subject matter. I would take a class with her again. \nShe expects you to participate, going as far as to call on you directly if you haven't been contributing to the discussion. Just do the reading and the rest takes care of itself.\nWorkload:\n15-20 pages of reading per class, 4 papers ranging from 4-10 pages, a presentation on one of the readings, and a one page response to a class activity. Easy sauce. Tie in the themes covered in class in an intelligent way, and you're bound to get an A.\n"
