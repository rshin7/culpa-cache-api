            "review_content": "\nProfessor Ammirato is a wonderful teacher and person. He clearly loves what he does - not only his life's work with plants, but teaching what he knows to others. He is an easy person to get along with and is always available. His exams and homework assignments are fair, along with his grading style. Although he is very understanding and accomodating, don't expect to get away with anything you didn't deserve. Overall, his kind personality makes plant physiology a desirable course, even for those clammering to get into animal physiology.\nWorkload:\n2 midterms, one final. For more advanced classes, some weekly or bi-weekly problem sets. For labs, weekly lab reports.\n"
