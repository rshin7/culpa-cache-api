            "review_content": "\nSahar has by far been one of the best teachers not only in my Columbia experience but in my entire life.  Hyper-intelligent, always well-prepared, Sahar always awes me with the depth of her preparation for each class as well as her ability to adapt to the natural and spontaneous changes in the course of student-led conversations.  I was impressed by her ability to (seemingly intuitively) balance the principles of seminar, allowing students to engage in a conversation together, with the goals of good teaching, also stepping in and providing guidance and instruction at the appropriate moments with thoughtful opinions and questions.  She also asks really thought-provoking questions that helped me think about the texts we read in a new way!\nIn seminars, group dynamic is so important.  I don\u2019t think I was just randomly blessed to have a great seminar group: I think that Sahar\u2019s teaching techniques contributed to the supportive, interesting conversations that we had.  She really obviously cares about each and every one of her students.  She is supportive in class and her comments on our papers were usually thorough (sometimes she acknowledged that they weren't and invited us to office hours, in which she is also very helpful).  She is a tough grader but her high standards made me a better writer and encouraged me to work harder.  \nI think by the same rule, her class expectations were really high\u2014we only cut one text (Faust), which we replaced with 2 others (Excerpts from Ibn Hazm's \"the Ring of the Dove\" which is very short and Tony Morrison's \"Beloved\") whereas I know other teachers cut many, and we definitely never had like \"movie day\" or anything; but her high expectations pushed me to actually read, learn, and ultimately feel incredibly accomplished at the close of the course.  \nI really tried to get the readings done most nights but I think Sahar also makes it pretty accessible even when you haven't read.  She is great with asking guided questions about specific passages and referencing (with page numbers) specific parts of the book, so you can still participate and respond in class.  Sometimes we split up into small groups in class and looked for information/themes in the books, which was tedious, but at the end of the day it was great when you hadn't done the readings :)\nWhile I don\u2019t think that anyone in our seminar completed all the readings on time, Sahar was ALWAYS prepared and engaged for every text we were expected to read.  She is SO thoughtful and thorough, I am impressed by her ability to prepare so well for each and every class. \nOverall one of the best!!!! \nWorkload:\n3-4 papers a semester (I forget how everything was weighted but she gives you a syllabus at the beginning of the year); \nI never got higher than maybe a 6/10 on a quiz and I was still in the A range both semesters. \nI am so, so glad that we didn\u2019t have any overly \"creative\" assignments or presentations or anything like \"write a poem about how this book made you feel.\"  Thank you for keeping it professional, Sahar. \nParticipation in class matters a lot! (I don't know how much it is weighted but Sahar really cares about it)\n"

            "review_content": "\nDabashi is arguably brilliant, as he seems to know everything about anything within his field and beyond it. The drawback, though, is that sometimes you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not sure if he might be BSing a little bit of it and being overblown in his own self-importance. Because Dabashi is fairly full of himself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dat least half of the assigned works on the syllabus were prefaced in class with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wrote this\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I inspired the filmmaker to make this,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d etc. Dabashi told us at the beginning of the semester that no question was a stupid question, but he then proceeded to make people terrified to speak by summarily shooting down some people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ideas that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with his own or that he thought were not terribly intelligent. Most of the class is based solely on his own ideas and opinions, no matter how much he claims to be adding in a lot of different perspectives.\nHalf the time, when Dabashi was lecturing, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even tell that this was a class on Islamic civilization. We talked about Kant and Habermas and other Western philosophy and political theory, and there was no real indication as to how we were supposed to connect it to the theme of Islamic civilization. Because Dabashi enjoyed talking about all of the off-topic topics so much, we got incredibly behind on the syllabus very quickly and never really discussed the last five or six items on the syllabus.\nThe workload for this class was completely unrealistic and absolutely murderous if you attempted to do every reading assigned. We generally had an entire book or movie (or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153selections\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of one, which generally meant about \u00c2\u00be of it) assigned for each class, but soon enough, I realized that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely necessary to read all of it. As the two big assignments of the class were papers that you could pick and choose among the assigned texts for, you could choose the texts that interested you and focus on getting a good handle on those (the only drawback to this approach was that if Dabashi randomly called on you to give a summary of the reading for that class\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich he did frequently\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand you hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read it, you were in the hot seat and subject to his public censure). On one day (two weeks before finals), when it became apparent that literally no one had watched the assigned movie for that class, he asked, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watching this movie over the last two days, what could you have possibly been doing?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe classic move of a professor who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize that we have classes other than his to worry about or might possibly need to have lives that are not 24/7 studying.\nBy the end of the semester, though, Dabashi lightened up a bit, because the only people left who still came to lecture were the ones who could deal with him. He even started joking a little bit with the ones of us he had come to know. But on the whole, the only thing to redeem Dabashi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shortcomings in this class was the fact that he clearly has a passion for the Middle East.\nMy TA, Sahar, however, was AMAZING. She was the shining light in the darkness that this class sometimes was. She knew so much about all of the topics the class covered (from what I saw, it seemed like she knew almost as much as Dabashi himself), and she, at least, made sure that we got through everything on the syllabus in our discussion section. She had a way of explaining things that made it all clear, and she always had suggestions for further reading or research\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtitles of countless relevant books and movies that she could just pull straight out of her head\u00e2\u20ac\u201dif a certain topic interested us. She was also extremely helpful in her office hours, and helped me work through all of my ideas for the final paper and gave me some tips as to what I could do better. She was always sunny and excited to teach, and got almost all of us in the section involved in and excited about the discussion by making us realize that the class material was actually really interesting and full of depth. Sahar was legitimately the one reason I was able to make it through this class with my sanity.\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking just to fulfill your global core requirement, I would recommend that you take this class (at least if Dabashi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teaching it; I get the sense that this class is much different when Saliba teaches it)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere are infinitely easier ways of getting that requirement.\n\nWorkload:\nMidterm essay (25%)\nFinal essay (50%)\nDiscussion section participation (25%)\n"

            "review_content": "\nI came into this class really looking forward to it. There were mixed reviews on CULPA, but I thought I was blown away during the first lecture. Dabahi walked around the room, talking about all of these super intellectual things. He went through the syllabus, explained the different books, and I was so intrigued. I was genuinely excited for the class.\nI was so, so wrong.\nDabash doesn't teach -- he let's the TAs present on the books, and then scribbles down loose notes on whatever he thinks up and then walks around the room, pontificating and making jokes. The TAs do all of the heavy lifting here, and he doesn't really explain what's going on. He just pontificates about Kant and tries to amaze the class with catchy phrases like \"We have to make the unfamiliar familiar by making the familiar unfamiliar.\" He gave us supposedly a book a lecture, but was so entrenched in his desire to pontificate that we quickly fell behind, and the TAs, who were responsible for telling us which parts of the books we were assigned, seemed to have given up around spring break, possibly because no one bothered to do the readings because *they didn't matter to the class.*\nMy TA, Sahar, was the only redeeming merit. She was clear, well-spoken, and actually made an effort to make the texts understandable, and she, at least, seemed to care more than Dabashi did.\nDon't do what I did, and fall for his theatrics and his talking points. The man is too busy thinking about how amazing he is, and doesn't really care about the class. If you're interested in this, wait until Saliba or someone else teaches the course in the future, or find a copy of the reading list and read the books yourself. They were the only redeeming merit of this course.\nWorkload:\nMidterm 5-page response paper (no citations needed) to one or two of the readings, and a 10-page research paper using the texts assigned on the syllabus (citations needed). There is basically a book a lecture, but you only have to read part of it (assuming the TAs are kind enough to tell you what you actually have to read). Discussion sections are mandatory.\n"
