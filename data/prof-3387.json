            "review_content": "\nProfessor Marakowitz is a really warm hearted, kind, person who is extremely approachable inside and outside the classroom. She tries very hard to encourage students to particpate in class and to make students of all levels and backgrounds integrate into the lectures. Though she can be somewhat frazzled at times, overall she makes the class very easy to do well in. If you do the readings and follow the (very specific and clear) instructions for the papers you are almost certain to get an A. \n\nWorkload:\n2 papers 10 pages each based on the readings. One class presentation. Six response papers. Everything very doable,  even enjoyable as you get to choose what you want to write on.\n"
