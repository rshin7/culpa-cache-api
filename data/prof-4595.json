Although she probably won't be around for long, Melissa is extremely passionate about the power of writing, and it definitely shows in her creativity for creating class structures and her active participation in all of our free-writes. University Writing can have some pretty bad teachers. Melissa is a major exception to the rule.\nWorkload:\nregular U-writing load... she's a pretty straight grader.\n"
