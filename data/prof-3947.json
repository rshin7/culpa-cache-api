She is very accessible to students outside of the classroom and is always willing to take more time to answer questions or just discuss art in general.  Nicole loves art and it shows.  She was a bit of a tough time with sticking to the syllabus, an artist that we were supposed to cover in one class often is covered in two, but nothing too bad.  \nClass is largely based on discussion, which can become frustrating to some people.  She will ask what you think about a certain piece and give minimum input about it herself.  However, from what I can understand, that is her goal: not to tell you what to think, but to make you figure it out for yourself.\nThe midterm is based on IDs and comparisons of paintings studied in class.\nWorkload:\n2 papers\nMidterm\nFinal\nWeekly reading\n"
