            "review_content": "\nProfessor Baswell changed my life. I went into The Canterbury Tales having half-read one Tale - not set on keeping the course past the shopping period. I'm an English major but I've never particularly been enthralled by Medieval Literature (and, generally, I'm still not). However, this course is easily the best course I've ever taken in my time here. He made the topic so exciting and I was genuinely so excited to go to class. It was the first class where I looked at the clock and was disappointed that we \"only\" had 45 minutes left.\nI recommend all English majors take this course. Heck, I recommend everyone take this course. I left the course feeling so confident in my understanding of the Tales - and no, I didn't do all the readings all the time.\nWorkload:\nThe readings themselves can be pretty hefty - you will get through every Tale. But, it's definitely manageable and the readings are interesting so that makes it easier. There are occasional \"pop quizzes\" on the translations of the Tales. I sometimes (oops!) read the Modern English versions (not the Middle English version as assigned) and always did well on these, as they're pretty intuitive. There is one short paper (3-5 pages, I believe), one midterm exam (IDs, essays, translations), one final paper (7-10 pages), and one non-cumulative final exam (same structure as midterm with IDs, short essays, and translations). \n"

            "review_content": "\nOkay, at the risk of being anonymously passive-aggressive toward my classmates, I'm gonna jump in here and respond mostly to the Nov. 5 review below this one.\nThe syllabus was definitely not pointless. Odd, sure, but certainly relevant in obvious ways to disability studies (though I may have to agree about the Pope...). Then again the class wasn't really supposed to be ~about~ disability studies anyway, or even necessarily about disability as it's most commonly interpreted. It's not a theory course or a methods course but a literature course based on body difference very broadly defined\u2014and that includes not just the obvious stuff like Jean-Dominique Bauby but weird shit like the magical talking wolves of medieval Ireland too. \n(Speaking of which, yes, there's a bit of a medieval bent to the syllabus, so if Beowulf and the saints' lives aren't your cup of tea, then the first couple weeks of the semester may well be a drag for you.)\nBasically this class allows for a lot of flexibility in what \"disability\" means, and I can understand why it would be off-putting to someone who's trying to get at a more mainstream/contemporary/political/social understanding of the subject. Personally, I really liked the eclectic approach, and I think that it made for a more interesting class than simply reading, I don't know, 20th-century memoir accounts one after another.\nTL;DR: This is a cool class and you should take it, unless you have some kind of unfortunate vendetta against medieval texts and using your imagination in which case you definitely shouldn't.\nWorkload:\nVery reasonable. He uses the midterms to make sure people are doing the reading, so if he can tell that the class is generally keeping up he'll cancel them (which is what happened with both of ours). Primary + secondary reading for each class, two shortish papers, a take-home essay final, and a bibliographical exercise. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class was truly disappointing. It's such an interesting topic, but the syllabus is just one boring, unreadable, pointless book after another. 2/3 of the course is dedicated to medieval/ancient texts that sort of relate to disability, but not enough to make us have to endure reading them. Seriously, it goes beyond boring mainstays like Beowulf and Canterbury Tales (although you read those too) - the syllabus approaches a whole next level of boring. You spend an entire class discussing \"History and Topography of Ireland,\" which is pretty much the ancient Irish equivalent of a mystical TripAdvisor entry. I still have no idea how it could possibly be even remotely relevant. Then there's the class about \"The Life of St. Osith,\" which may have been even more dreadful than the Ireland book! Pope, Montaigne and Locke each get their own classes too, and while they are all certainly very important to the study of western literature, they really don't have much to say about disability. You'd be better off taking a class just on 17th century lit. Professor Baswell is a nice guy, and he knows his stuff, but the class itself is miserable. \nWorkload:\nPretty standard. 2 essays, reading for every class, 2 midterms that ultimately got cancelled.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Baswell is a gem.  Not only is he a fantastic professor, he is a truly delightful individual.  His knowledge of medieval literature is absolutely astounding and his enthusiasm is irrepressible.  Furthermore, he is genuinely invested in the success of his students.  He made himself very available during office hours and was very helpful in scheduling meetings outside of his office hours to accommodate student's needs.  \n I would happily pay a million dollars to listen to him read Middle English to me all day. His pronunciation is absolutely beautiful.\nBaswell's tests are fair and reasonable.  I found I didn't need to do any studying outside of class to prepare for his tests.  I paid attention and took notes during every class and was able to do well on the tests with almost no additional effort.  \nBaswell is no push over and his grading reflects his high standards.  I would say that Baswell is a fair grader and makes up for any toughness with his willingness to help during the writing process.\nOverall, I would highly recommend taking a class with Prof. Baswell.  He's the kind of professor you want to learn from and grab a coffee or beer with after class. \nWorkload:\nDepending on what you are reading, he'll assign 20-45 pages per class.  2 essays, 2 midterms and a take home final.\n"

            "review_date": "December 11, 2011",
            "review_content": "\nI have taken two classes with Professor Baswell, Canterbury Tales in Fall 2009 and Chaucer Before Canterbury (which was a broad survey of Chaucer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other works, some post-Canterbury) in Spring 2011, and am baffled by the paucity of reviews here.  There is no question that he is one of the most insightful, encouraging, and motivated professors I have encountered in my time at Columbia.  \nWhat do you expect from a college-level English lecture?  Baswell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Canterbury Tales was my first, and I still have yet to encounter another professor whose approach surpasses what was on display there.  It will of course be obvious that no particular style can satisfy every student.  Baswell taught in a manner that accommodated student questions and participation (which, admittedly, was always welcome, and indeed solicited, but rarely offered willingly) but which required none.  I left this 9 a.m. class every time in a daze; his exposition of the text took on the gravity of a sermon, and always deftly wove historical details and knowledge Chaucer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal life into the analysis.  I can hardly imagine readings more cogent than those offered by Baswell (you cannot doubt his mastery of and love for the texts).  The Canterbury Tales is a dirty, profound, and moving work.  It is by turns vulgar and sacred, and all of it is heady stuff when you start to take apart the accruing layers.  And did I mention you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be reading it all in the original Middle English?\nDon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be turned off by the age of the poem, as Chaucer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sensibilities were presciently modern and his concerns (it feels trite to say so) timeless.  The range on display here, and the sensitivity to perspective rivals anything I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read post-18th century (if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where your interests lie).  This is vital stuff.\nBaswell is an understanding guide if you find yourself struggling, and his pop quizzes keep you on top of the work (the quizzes are standard translation exercises, with an occasional question that forces you to demonstrate a clear knowledge of the assigned reading).  The two papers (one short paper, and one longer, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmore ambitions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on a topic of your choosing) are also very fairly graded, and the midterm and final\u00e2\u20ac\u201din spite of the nerve-wracking proposition of text identifications\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare fairly relaxed, and not designed to consume the entirety of the allocated testing period.  Although it seems prudent to say that Baswell is not fond of technology, so don't expect any assignments through courseworks (by email, perhaps).  This is hardly a hindrance, as the Norton editions of the assigned texts contain most everything you'll need, and the internet links provided on the syllabus round out your available resources.\nI will note that I found Chaucer Before Canterbury to be a bit more disorganized than Canterbury Tales.  The bulk of the semester was devoted to Chaucer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second masterpiece, Troilus and Criseyde.  Because that poem is more introverted, and perhaps less immediately compelling, I found that the lectures occasionally sagged beneath explications of the plot (I suspect this shift in strategy might have been a consequence of the students in the class, not all of whom kept up with the work).  But the analyses of Chaucer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early and later short poems (and his Dream Visions) were top-notch.  This is a course I would recommend after having spent some time with Canterbury Tales (although it too is designed for newcomers to Middle English), primarily because it supplies a different view of the author\u00e2\u20ac\u201dyou see Chaucer probing new territories and steadying his focus, with mixed results overall.  The courseload hardly varies from what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve mentioned above.\nBaswell is the real thing:  a brilliant scholar and a devoted professor.  He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing if not a credit to the department, and it's time someone brought that to greater light. \n\nWorkload:\nThis is a standard English class: readings every week (all in Middle English, which you'll become accustomed to fairly quickly), an in-class midterm, and an essay-based final.  2 papers, one short and one long.  And a final test at the end of the semester (non-cumulative) in the style of the midterm.\n"

            "review_content": "\nChristopher Baswell is an extremely cool guy. He is passionate about what he is teaching, and very, very smart, and funny. You will enjoy his lectures. His insights into the material are interesting, and he is a generous teacher- you will feel comfortable asking questions. He often praises students' questions or observations but he is not jerking your chain- if you are engaged in the reading and he can see that, he will appreciate it.\nThe course I took with him was Social Topics in Literature: Disability. We read literature and disability theory side by side. He has a lot to say about both sides of the syllabus, so be attentive to his lectures. It is possible to just skim a lot of the reading and still do well, but you must come to class to do well- use the ideas he offers in his lectures, get into the ideas of the course, and you will do well.\nWorkload:\nOne bibliographic essay, two 6-page papers, two in-class midterms (which are easy, and just to see if you have done any reading), take-home final.\n"
