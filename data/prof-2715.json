            "review_content": "\nProf. Brown (or Wesley, I suppose - he's not picky) was always engaged in our class discussions and cognizant of what each writer was trying to do in their work. He also managed to find interesting things to discuss no matter how bad the story was, although nearly everything that I read this semester I found fairly interesting. Wesley always had good reading suggestions and an ability to steer the discussion to areas that needed work in each piece. \nInterestingly enough I found his verbal in-class comments to be much more helpful than his written comments, but by taking notes on my own work I was more than happy with what I got out of class discussions. Recommended.\nWorkload:\n3 stories, more or less - you can continually revise throughout the semester and present a revised piece, if you like. He also gave asked us to read Eudora Welty's \"On Writing\", although we didn't really discuss it in class.  Final portfolio; grading, I thought, was fair-to-generous.\n"
