            "review_content": "\nSo this class was pretty much hell on earth, to be honest. It sucks because the material was actually pretty interesting but the professor was just not the best. I know this has been said before on other reviews for Fleischer but I got As on most of my essays in high school and my first two essays (out of three) I got Cs. I'm fighting for a B in the class which is just not where I want to be my first semester of college. The prof gives weird feedback and hates passive verbs (seriously they are her enemy) but when I go to her office hours she just asks me a bunch of questions about my work and doesn't answer my questions. She's actually pretty nice during class time but then I keep getting these horrible grades and not improving. It's very frustrating. I just feel like she hasn't taught me how to write better, which defeats the purpose of first year writing.\nWorkload:\nThree essays (two of them were 4-6 pages and the final paper is 6-8 pages). Reading for every class, rarely difficult. One provocation, it was not hard.  The essays are the hardest part, especially because they are worth so much of your grade and she's such a harsh grader. A couple of opportunities for extra credit.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThere are already a ton of comments talking about how difficult this class is, so i'm not going to waste your time repeating that. Instead, if you are reading this, you probably were assigned to a class you cannot change. But there is hope! I got an A in this class and so can you. Here's how: \n1. REREAD THE TEXT. You will hear this phrase repeated ad nauseam in her classroom, but it really is one of the best ways to succeed. If you are reading a book that you aren't going to write a paper on (majority of the books), then skimming the text is fine. You can probably even get away with skipping a reading or two, although I wouldn't recommend it. Reading every text allows you to contribute to her in-class writing activities, which are sort of like ungraded pop quizzes (will elaborate below). However, if you are writing a paper on a book, you need to read it at least twice; once with the class, and once independently when you are writing the paper. You need to know this text EXTREMELY well to succeed- any slight mischaracterization or misinterpretation will cost you greatly in the paper. \n2. Do EVERY extra credit opportunity: As mentioned above, Fleischer without warning asks students to complete in-class writing activities, for which you will receive a grade of a check minus, check, or check plus. Every check plus equals extra credit. She will read out loud the best one or two responses in these activities, and if that happens to you a couple of times, you WILL see an increase in your grade at the end of the semester. In order to be successful at these, DO ALL READINGS. In addition, complete peer review throughly and as often as possible. \n3. Class participation is about depth not breath: Yes, it is important to contribute to discussion regularly in her class, but she will appreciate 1-2 thoughtful and unique comments much more than you giving 10 comments that consist of your opinion or are just extending another classmate's comments (unfortunately, I saw many people try the second strategy). Also, as the year goes on, whenever you can make a connection to a previous text or supplement essay, DO SO. \n4. GO TO OFFICE HOURS: Her first draft comments consist largely of pointing out grammar errors and expressing general dissatisfaction with your writing. Office hours will give you an opportunity to actually hear what she has to say about your writing. Whatever suggestions she makes, DO THEM, even if you don't agree. \n5. GO TO THE WRITING CENTER: As many times as humanly possible! Not only will this improve the quality of your writing (seriously, it will), it also will impress Fleischer- when you turn in your drafts, she asks you to include drafts you gave to a writing fellow. This shows her that you are making an extra effort to improve your writing and she will reward you for that. \n6. Do not give up!: I received a b- on one of the 3 papers and still finished with an A due to her generous grade adjustment from extra credit and class participation. Many students do very poorly on the first test and then resign themselves to a low grade, and don't put in much effort. This is very obvious to Fleischer and it will make her dislike you. Instead, if you get a bad grade on your first paper (most people do), go to office hours as soon as possible to discuss with her your grade. Do NOT attempt to argue for a better score or express disagreement with the text; only ask for ways in which you can improve. \nGOOD LUCK!!! \nWorkload:\n2 3-5 page papers, one 8-10 page paper. Everyone takes a turn leading class discussion one day. \n"

            "review_content": "\nMy comments hardly differ from what has already been said about Professor Fleischer, but I will state them nonetheless. Let me start off by saying that in the classroom, Georgette is fine. She is certainly passionate about the texts she teaches and is willing to engage with students. With only a few weeks left in her classroom, I will say that she is willing to entertain most notions about the text, even if they do differ from her own. Now on to the bad\u2026Georgette often goes off on tangents that hardly relate to the class discussion only so she can show off her knowledge of an irrelevant detail of the text. This is fine, but boring and a bit egotistic. My biggest point of distress in this class is her grading. The woman is so out of her mind, clearly she does not understand that she is teaching FIRST YEARS. Georgette acts as if we're grad students writing incredibly important pieces, when in actuality her class is required and while I'm sure some people are enthusiastic about the course, almost all of us are also in at least three other classes. First-Year English simply is not at the top of our lists! Her grading is harsh, to say the least. I don't mean the actual grade, as I find she often gives better grades than her comments imply, but the comments themselves border on hurtful. She is the first to mark everything wrong with your essay, down to simple grammar mistakes, and hardly ever has anything positive to say about it. Once again, she is teaching first years, and this technique is simply not effective with those who are already self-conscious about their writing. First-Year English is meant to help Barnard students, and while I know that a certain amount of critical reading is important, there at least needs to be a positive side. I have never received a nice comment on my work from Professor Fleischer, and I am a fairly competent writer. I am a prospective English major, and I must say, Georgette has taken all of the fun out of this class for me. Now with that being said, it is possible to survive this class. The texts are enjoyable (at least I found them so) and the class discussions are usually helpful. There are only a total of three papers due, so if you put aside your feelings and possibly your hope for an A, you will be fine. I will say, I find it deplorable that Barnard chooses to stick Georgette with first years. I understand that a First-Year English teacher is basically as low as you can get, but it's unfair.\nWorkload:\nNot too bad. As long as you don't have to write an essay on a specific book, it's pretty easy to skip it and bullshit your way through the discussions. When it comes to paper time, though, best of luck!\n"

            "review_content": "\nBefore taking this class I read all of the reviews on Professor Fleischer, and a lot of it is true. However, a lot of people are overly harsh due to the fact that Fleischer is a tough grader. Yes, a lot of people get a B or lower on their first essay, but it is very easy to do better. Like a lot of english teachers, she has her own opinions and grades accordingly. I am not condoning this but, since it is apparent in her class, there is no reason to try and go against her comments on your paper. \nAlso, one of the most helpful thing is GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS. Many people do not take advantage of this and, as a result, don't do as well as they might hope. If you're not willing to put in the time, then of course you won't see it in the results. Also, especially for her class, go to the writing center!! They can help with grammatical errors that Fleischer might not comment on in the first draft, as well as they can help redirect your essay if Fleischer basically tells you to rewrite it (Which will happen at least once). \nShe also gives extra credit points for participation. As long as you read the given readings it is really not hard to talk once or twice during a class period and get points- considering each is lead by a student and questions are given to start conversation.\nI also believe her essay system is great. You hand in your first draft to her and she hands it back with her thoughts on it. Then you rewrite it with an outline and have a peer review. *****If you do the peer review well she also gives you extra credit***** ( so do them well because they actually do boost your grade). She reads the outline AND AGAIN gives comments, which is very generous. Then you write it a third time and that is the one you hand in. She gives you a week between each draft- giving you many changes to go to her office hours, writing center, etc. Again, very generous.\nHonestly, if you're willing to listen to her criticism and ideas on your essay, then you will do fine. I enjoyed her class because I thought that she had some great ideas, and if you're willing to overlook the fact that she may give you a bad grade, she may not be that terrible of an academic teacher. We go to an academically challenging school and she is an academically challenging teacher. \nWorkload:\nA good number of books (a little excessive because we read most of them for a one day discussion), a provocation (one student leads the class discussion on a reading with a part of the text and 2 questions), two 3-4 pg papers, one 6-8 pg \"research paper\"\n"

Still, she's really not as bad as a lot of people make her out to be.  She can be quite boring, but she's generally a very nice and knowledgable professor.\nNow, before I mislead you into thinking she's just another mediocre professor, I should note that there's a big reason why people hate her with such vehemence - she is NOT an easy grader.  Her comments can be downright brutal and solid As on essays are exceptionally rare.  However, contrary to what other reviewers have said, I don't think her grading standards are unfair.  Yes, she's honest, she's a stickler about grammar, and she doesn't put up with BS, but she gives first-years a much-needed dose of reality (no, you're not a good writer just because you got an A+ in AP English) and definitely helps improve her students' writing.  \nEven though it can be tough to get good essay grades, it's pretty easy to get a good grade in the course as a whole.  She's definitely not like some of the newer FYS/FYE professors who missed the whole \"A-pluses don't exist in college\" memo and give good grades to anyone with a pulse, but as long as you're a fairly good writer and at least try to contribute to class discussions, you'll most likely do well.  Bonus points if you manage to get on Professor Fleischer's good side.\nWorkload:\nStandard amount of reading for an English course, one \"provocation\" (leading a class discussion), two short essays with two drafts each (the second draft typically requires substantial revision), and one longer research paper with multiple drafts.\n"

She likes to listen to herself talk, and she fails to ask any provocative questions, leading to VERY boring discussions.\nThe best way to succeed in this course is to attend her office hours as often as you possibly can! She will claim to read and edit your first drafts of each essay, but her comments are illegible, and the ones that are legible are usually about grammar mistakes. She will not read for content when looking over your first draft, so it is up to you to go and speak with her during office hours to go over what she really thinks about the content of your essay. Make sure to ask her the right questions during office hours, otherwise she will advise you to \"go back and work more with the text.\" TAKE ALL OF HER ADVICE, even if you fundamentally disagree with it. She does not give grades based on your own creativity, but rather on how closely you stick to her interpretation of the text. \nOnce you talk with Professor Fleischer one-on-one, it is evident that she is a really nice, caring person, who is invested in her students.

Also, she is horribly pretentious (a theme in Women and Culture) and refuses to use the word \"you.\" This applies not only to writing, but also to class discussions and in response to questions that are clearly looking for a \"you\" in response to a \"should I.\" Please give up hope for a decent grade or a hope to learn something upon entering the classroom. Her grades are unrealistic and her comments are unhelpful. You are likely to find feedback that has nothing to do with the topic you wrote about, but that everyone else got the same comment. Take care in the fact that you're all in it together. Avoid her at all costs.

HOWEVER you don't get much say in First-Year English professors, so here's a brief survival guide.\nHow to come out with an A:\nWrite ONLY opinions she would agree with.  With many professors, you need to generally slant your essay toward their opinions, but with Fleischer you must write such that she agrees 100% with all of your points.\nFollow ALL her suggestions from the first draft.\nWrite about things that seem to interest her.  If she doesn't like your ideas for a research prospectus, DO NOT attempt to salvage it.  Talk to her about what might be a better idea and do whatever she says.\nPut a lot of effort into the peer reviews.  You get extra credit.\nParticipate in class discussion.  Quality over quantity: the goal is to get her to like you.\nHow to learn some things despite having a terrible professor:\nThink of the course partly as an English Grammar intensive.  More than anything else, Fleischer can help improve the structure of your writing.\nDo the readings!  Most of the reading list is fantastic.  So many feminist mind-blown moments.  It's not necessary to get an A, but if you read some things besides your essay subjects, you'll learn.\nPay attention if she goes on a tangent about literary theory.

She teaches you how to critically read text in a way you never thought possible, and she helps you to reach simplicity and strength in your argument for your paper. \nNow, I'm not going to be too negative here, but Professor Fleischer is intimidating. For your first essay, she will likely try to tell you that your essay is terrible (she told me I needed to buy a dictionary) and you need to re-write it.

We were forced to come up with our theses within her very limited framework, which I have never been asked to do before in an English class.  Luckily, the rough drafts were ungraded, which definitely saved my grade.  She expected us to write three drafts of the essays, which was pretty ridiculous.  We also had to meet with her between drafts for all three essays, and she was not running on time for any of those meetings.  \nDespite all this, she was a fair grader and gave us many opportunities to work out the kinks in our drafts.   \nWorkload:\nThe regular amount of reading for a first year english, but you really don't have to do a lot of it.

Also during that conference, she told me to change my thesis statement to a completely difference one, but when I did that in my final draft, she said that my thesis statement did not answer the question I was triyng to answer. In brief, I have to say that Prof. Fleischer is a good teacher who has, however, too high expectations of us as writers and therefore makes it impossible to get an A in her class.\nWorkload:\nStandard - 3 essays.

I went into the class having read all the bad reviews, and thats probably why I just didnt like her for the first half of the semester. Gradually, I snapped out of it and realized there was nothing at all horrible about her or the class. My guess is that the bad reviews are written by students who didnt get an \"A\" in the class. And honestly, you may not. \nFleisher is not one to hand out easy A's. You really have to work hard and write an excellent essay for an A. Still, grades can be improved my going to class, participating, and doing peer reivews. A meeting with her per paper helps you figure out what she is looking for. Im not sure where the belief that she only wants to read about what she thinks comes from, because she constantly urged us to make the essays our own. She is keen on grammar which I found useful and helpful. Judging from the reviews from past years, she really tries to cater the class to students needs, as several changes have been made from the days of 3 required drafts and grammar quizes. I found nothing rude about her. She was generally very pleasant, and accepting of everyone's views. My suggestion to get the most out of the class is to do the readings and participate in class discussions. I think this class is pretty much standard for First Year English- it wont change your life, but it its nowhere near unbearable. \nWorkload:\nTwo 3-4 page papers, one final 6-8 page research paper. \nAt least 2 drafts for each.

She is a MAJOR stickler for grammar which was a complete piss off to me since we spent HALF of each class talking about the mistakes in various papers. And the paper did have to be written about a topic that she thought good, not the one you actually choose.\nBut otherwise, I think the problem with the class was due more to the fact that Legacy is a boring class with readings that I've done three times since fifth grade (i.e. The Odyssey) but if you interject your opinions and participate at least once every class, you'll do fine.\nAlso I give her props for taking over my class after Professor Baechler passed away.

First year english was not the greatest experience of academia but it certainly wasn't unbearable, and I did well in the class.  She does tend to stifle opinions of others and take definite sides in class \"discussions\" - really more like arguments and it is quite hard and intimidating to agree with her if you are concerned about your grade.  Also, rudely, she berated anyone who dared to trail in a couple minutes behind her.  She has these note cards for each student and whenever someone came in late or didn't show without first emailing, she'd whip them out and put little checks or whatever on them.  So yes, she is particular about attendance to the point of being obnoxious. I think she may grade based on what she thinks of you as a person, but that may not be a fair assumption.  One more thing, she goes off on Ridiculous (with a capital R!) tangents for literally a half hour, no exagerration, when you get to modernism - just watch out for Virginia Woolfe and Gertrude Stein (yes, I'm afraid of Virginia Woolfe around her -sorry, had to stick that it).  But really she doesn't know when to stop; she definitely likes the sound of her own voice.  Ok, on a brighter note, she's passionate, interesting, fosters good discussions, and has these great things called oral discussion convocations (they sounds scary but they're not). Every class one student picks a passage from the reading and writes two questions about it and that's what we discuss the next day. It's really a great little thing because it gets everyone involved in the discussion and brings it to a peer level.  A lot of people were offended by the peer editing; I wasn't.  I figure we're all battling the same demon anyway. I don't think any first years were judging me, nor I them.

Her own editing comments are useless, stifling, and often somewhat limited to the grammatical, and the insigth she ofers into the reading material is bound to her most recent research project or another class she is teaching.

I wish someone had warned me about her when I took her class freshman year - she's absolutely horrid. Once seen grading papers on Low steps about 5 min. before class. I think almost everyone in my class complained to the dept. about her, but somehow she's still around, so watch out.\nWorkload:\nIt's Comp. 1, so lots of papers, about 1 every other week, based on short readings. Basically regurgitation of Fleischer's opinions or get ready for a low grade.\n"

Your writing will not improve in this class; you will only regress in ability. Her comments are not useful, and she's looking for mistakes instead of looking to understand your essay. She gives you C\u00c2\u2019s when ever possible. She acts like teaching is a major burden. Her assignments make no sense and unless you make your thesis unbelievably simple she will tell you that you make no real argument. If you ask her to explain what she wants from the assignment she looks at you like you\u00c2\u2019re an idiot for not understanding her gibberish then proceeds to explain in an esoteric and nonsensical way so you are more confused. This woman is stone cold and has no personal depth that would make her a good professor. She will make you hate writing.\nWorkload:\nAverage . . . but the emotional damage is not worth it . . . plus it is a gross waste of money\n"

Even if it's the only class that fits your schedule, it's not worth the boredom, stress and pain you encounter in that class. She has a way of killing the most beautiful works with her condescending demeanor, and she genuinely seems to want her students to fail. If you do take her class, though, make sure that your papers have a thesis clear enough for an idiot to understand it, because otherwise she'll tell you that your argument is weak and vague.\nWorkload:\nTen essays, midterm, final, provocation on an author. The class reads one of your papers and tears it apart as best possible. And she's a tough grader.\n"
