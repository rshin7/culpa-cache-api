            "review_content": "\nSophie was a fine teacher, especially considering it was her first semester here, and really fun and sweet as well.  The assignments and workload were very straightforward, there was a lot of variance to class activities to keep things interesting, and we covered a decent amount of material.  She's not a native speaker, but I'm not of the school of thought that natives automatically make better teachers, and overall she has a great accent and knew what she was talking about.  Definitely recommended!\nWorkload:\nReally manageable--one or two exercises due per class, four short compositions throughout the semester (the grade for which is the average of your first and corrected copies), small tests every other week, and a final (with oral).  Standard for beginning languages.\n"
