            "review_content": "\nI'm still a little confused on if I like Professor Gravdal or not. She's a little flighty, a little scattered, but very sweet and a lot of fun. She really wants you to discuss the issues, and tries to cover a wide spectrum of topics regarding feminism in different disciplines. Lots of hands on presentations, and not too time consuming.\nWorkload:\nThe workload varied greatly week to week, sometimes from having hindreds of pages and two response papers to having nothing. Mainly, participation and response papers will get you far, and a 5 page research proposal at the end is really it for your grade.\n"
