He's also very approachable and a generous grader.  If you can, take a class with this man!\nWorkload:\nOne group project that takes maybe 6 hours over four weeks, culminating in a group five page paper.  Some (pretty optional) reading.  Open book, open note final that is straightforward and not hard if you've paid attention in class.\n"
