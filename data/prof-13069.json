BUT, professor Gunel has a very poor English, it is very hard to understand and focus. More than 70% of the students left after the first class. \nThroughout the semester, professor Gunel was barely involved in the class. Her approach of the subject matters was very dull. She was reading her notes for the entire length of the class, commenting upon the readings in a very mechanical approach for more than 90% of class time.\nNot a class I recommend AT ALL. \nWorkload:\nOne take-home midterm, one final paper, 2 film reviews, 10 quizzes (which is totally absurd)\n"
