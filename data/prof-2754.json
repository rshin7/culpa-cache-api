Kaufman and Gonzalez are both excellent lecturers who have a great grasp of the material, which doesn't seem too hard at first when you are talking about the ideal gas law. Unfortunately, the exams are insane. Recitation can be helpful to understanding the material, but the quizzes always contain curveballs that require extensive preparation from questions in the book or assumptions that aren't spelled out for you. Many of the quizzes had an average of about 1.5/3. OWL questions are somewhat helpful in preparing for exams/quizzes. Be prepared for questions on exams that TAs even have some trouble solving. Gonzalez's tests in particular offer a particular brand of cruelty that makes you question taking the course itself. Several questions on Gonzalez's exams are trick questions that throw you off completely, and on other questions you have no idea which principles to apply or how to set up an equation. This is particularly true when studying acid base equilibria and titrations. Read the textbook or seek out other resources if you want to gain a better understanding of the material, (though Gonzalez takes his lectures from Zumdahl itself) but don't stress too much about this course because the exams and quizzes are difficult for everybody. Do all the practice problems on OWL and many problems in the book, and you'll do at least the average (or better) on exams and quizzes. The class is curved to a B/B-. \nTAs are hit or miss. I had Lea Benkoski, she was pretty good at explaining material but said we needed to study more when we only got 1/3 on her impossible quizzes. She expected us to have the background and experience of upper level chemistry students who studied in France, as she did. I think quizzes were the same in every recitation.\nGood luck.\nWorkload:\n8 recitation quizzes throughout the semester, 2 are dropped. (Very difficult, out of 3 points)\n3 exams consisting of 20 multiple choice questions. Average was around 12/20 on the first exam (gas laws, vapor pressure, Henderson Hasselbach) 10/20 on the second midterm (titration, acids and bases, pH, buffers) and 13/20 on the third exam (thermo, rate laws, kinetics).\nThe final is ridiculous, out of 40 questions, which you have 3 hours to complete.\nThe lowest 20% is dropped (half of the final, one of the exams, or all of the quizzes)\nI got the average or slightly above on the 2/3 exams, 1 std. deviation below on another exam, average on quizzes, dropped half of the final, and got a B-. \n"

            "review_content": "\nComing from David Reichman's Gen Chem I class, this class was very organized and well-run. Professor Kaufman taught the first half of the semester, and her lectures were clear and presented along with comprehensive slides that were posted prior to each class. She handled questions well, she was nice, and she wanted to make sure we understood everything. Professor Gonzalez took over for the second half of the semester, and his slides were the exact same format as Professor Kaufman's, so the class did not feel disjointed even though the professor changed. Like Kaufman, Gonzalez presented clearly and was very open to questions. Overall, I'd say both professors gave me a positive in-class experience.\nEach of their lectures were interspersed with iClicker questions designed to keep us engaged and to make sure we were understanding the material. I found that they were helpful, and if my mind was drifting away from chem, the questions would help refocus me. They weren't too hard, and you could talk about them with your neighbors. Plus, if you get 50% or more correct and you happen to be one of the top 3 people in your grade range, you get bumped up to the higher grade. (i.e. if you had the second highest B+ in the class, that would become an A-)\nHonestly, coming to the lectures was not enough to do well in the class. That said, the trick to doing well was *not* reading the textbook. Instead, the key was to do as many practice problems as possible. Both professors posted problems on OWL, and I did nearly every problem that they posted. I would do the relevant problems before each recitation quiz, and then I would do any remaining and relevant OWL problems before each midterm. Many of the questions on the exam that people thought were difficult were actually very similar to an OWL problem or two, so I found that doing the homework (even though it was technically ungraded) really helped me do well in the class. Note that you really need to know your stuff for the midterms, but if you know how to do all the OWL problems, it will ensure that you know your stuff.\nOverall, I had a very positive experience in this class. Sure, there were a handful of deceptive problems on each exam, but they don't make or break you, and they separate the men from the boys (or, to be politically correct, the adults from the kids). Pay attention, do plenty of practice problems, and you should be fine.\nWorkload:\n-8 quizzes, lowest 2 dropped (20% total)\n-3 midterms (20% each)\n-1 final (40% each)\nThat adds up to 120%, so you can drop the lowest 20%, whether that be a midterm, all of your quizzes, or your final can only count for 20% instead of 40%.\nWorkload was heavy. I spent multiple hours before my recitation doing practice problems, and then I studied a ton the day before each exam. Studying for the quizzes each week meant that I didn't need to study more than a day or two before each midterm. I highly recommend keeping up with the material!\n"

            "review_content": "\nThe reviews for this course are mostly accurate, but don't let them scare you. The key is persistence. The exams are very hard with averages in the 50 to 65 range, there's not much of an opportunity for extra credit, and they curve to a B-/B. You will think the exams are unreasonable, but it just takes a lot of practice to be able to think through the problems the right way. Read the questions carefully and understand what they're asking you to do. Think of it like learning a language: do a little bit of work every day and eventually it will start to come naturally. It's best to start consistent practice right off the bat, but even if you have a bad start and mess up the first couple of exams, you can still do it. I got scores very close to the mean for all three midterms, but I buckled down and committed to practicing and I did really well on the final and ended up with an A-. Success is possible. Don't get discouraged. Keep trying. \nWorkload:\n8 recitation quizzes, 3 midterms, 1 final, worst exam equivalent dropped. Do the optional OWL homework because you need the practice!\n"

Be prepared for a splash of cold water!\nIn Gen Chem I, I was able to pull of an A with barely any studying; however, Gen Chem II with Kaufman and Gonzalez is a completely different story. First of all, the recitation quizzes in this class (with TA Nevette Bailey Chandler) were HORRIBLE. The quizzes ranged from incredibly hard (averages of 1.0-1.5 out of 3) to deceptively easy. \nSecondly, the midterms are much harder. The first midterm covers material taught by Kaufman and is harder but pretty straightforward. The other 2 midterms (Acid Base / Thermo) are based mainly on Gonzalez lectures. The Acid Base midterm has an average of 50 and was very tricky. The thermo midterm is not as bad, but still pretty hard.\nKaufman and Gonzalez are both decent lecturers (very based on the textbook); however, Gonzalez has a penchant for creating tricky, deceptive questions. He even says so directly. \nYou definitely have to work your butt off in this class doing problems and reading from the textbook. \nWorkload:\nHeavy. Weekly recitation quizzes (8 of them, you drop 2). 3 midterms. You drop a 100 point equivalent. Final. Optional HW (for good and bad...)\n"

If you can't don't even bother going to lectures because you won't learn anything there. Read the book and you'll learn more. Sure, there's \"extra credit\" if you go to lectures and answer half the clicker questions right, but that only applies to a maximum 20 people in the class because it will only count if you are in the top three of your particular grade band. Then and only then can you get bumped up 1/3 of a grade. This policy only adds to the sense of competition the instructors seem to encourage between classmates.\nThe tests are designed to trip you up. They are demoralizing and disheartening and make you hate chemistry. This has been by far my least favorite class at Columbia. I took a 4000 level class in the same semester, and felt that this 1000 level course was harder.

            "review_content": "\nFirst off, Prof. Kaufman \u00e2\u20ac\u201cTo me, she seemed like a good professor at first; she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite eloquent in lecture and her PowerPoint slides are aesthetically pleasing. Well, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s before you realize that Prof. Kaufman appears to be lecturing from some sort of script that eloquently regurgitates the Zumdahl textbook. I can understand why some people like her lecture style. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s super clear and concise about everything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on her script. \nTry asking her a question about the class material that asks about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WHY,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as opposed to simply the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153WHAT.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d She seemed dumbfounded by questions asked by students that threw her off the script. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not to suggest she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the answer to the questions that students posed to her. She was just very, very insecure in her teaching abilities and had difficulty conveying chemical principles (outside her script) to her audience. I agree with the previous review that Prof. Kaufman seemed standoff-ish at times, and she was quite unhelpful and awkward at office hours, where she struggled to tackle Zumdahl textbook problems on the spot. On the bright side, Prof. Kaufman did many demonstrations (which were more interesting than her teaching), used iClickers to attempt to engage the class, baked fudge for the class, and had a dog in her office, which relieved the awkwardness of her office hours and her very weak teaching skills. \nNext up, Prof. Gonzalez \u00e2\u20ac\u201c He seemed to be more confident in his teaching abilities and his ability to convey chemical concepts to the class, and I thought he was the better professor.. Unlike Prof. Kaufman, Prof. Gonzalez was able to answer students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 questions and address their concerns / confusion with the course material extremely well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6that is, IF you choose to ask him a question. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite helpful in office hours and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very friendly guy who has a clear command of the subject matter. \nNow here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the problem. This guy, despite being a rising research star and his vast knowledge of the topics that we covered, made little to no effort to engage the class. Like Prof. Kaufman, Prof. Gonzalez\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lectures regurgitated Zumdahl, went over the same exact examples from the Zumdahl textbook, and, as previous reviewers suggested, his slides were peppered with typos. He did few demonstrations, started teaching with iClickers but seemed to have forgotten about them by the end of the semester, and spoke in a very, slow deliberate way that made the class quite boring. I found it pathetic how little he seemed to care about the class. If he put some more effort into teaching, he could really make a very good chemistry professor. \nI got an A for the class. While this class is co-taught by Prof. Gonzalez and Prof. Kaufman, we should add a third professor (the best one of the three) to that list: Steven Zumdahl. My recommendation is to study from Zumdahl and do as many practice problems with the solutions manual as you can. Mastering the Zumdahl questions will help you prepare for the curveballs on Kaufman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tests. Test averages were fairly low for the midterms (~70 M/T 1, ~50-60 M/T 2, ~60-70 M/T 3). Quiz averages were atrocious (~1-2 out of 3 points for each quiz). So do work hard, beat the curve, and best of luck. You have a lot of independent studying to do. \n\nWorkload:\n3 midterms, 8 quizzes (lowest two dropped) that count for a midterm, 1 final (counts for two midterms). Lowest midterm equivalent dropped. You need at least 1 standard deviation above the mean to get an A- (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roughly a 90 on the first test, 75 on the second, 80 on the third). To get an A, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to score well above one standard deviation. \n"
