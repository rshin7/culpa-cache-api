She chose articles that won't put you to sleep and made them relevant to college students' lives.  Christine is really easy to get in touch with and welcomes any questions you have either in or out of class.  Her help in revising my drafts was phenomenal.  \nWorkload:\nstandard university writing work.  four(?) papers, a couple of one page exercises after reading an article.  light reading.\n"

She was pretty lax about how you chose to approach the boring and weird essays outlined by the department.  Sometimes she let the students talk too much.  Not a bad grader.\nWorkload:\nregular for UW\n"
