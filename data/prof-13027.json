I would say the only bad part about him is that he does not stop talking from the time the class begins to when it ends so I sleep at least a little every class. If you read, you will definitely succeed in his class. Great prof!\nWorkload:\nNo pop quizzes or anything like that. A midterm, 2 four page papers, a 6 page paper, a few one page response papers, and a final\n"
