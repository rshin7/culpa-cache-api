            "review_content": "\nWorst class I have ever taken. Dabashi clearly has some kind of big-shot rep, but this class was no evidence for why. I have seen Facebook posts from him that show more effort than this entire class. This class was pain, and everyone spent the entire thing on Facebook\nHe arrives with no notes whatsoever, says 'What are we doing today?' and riffs on a couple sentences unhelpfully for the rest of the class. There is no structure or substance. The syllabus was a hilariously ambitious list of history books, films, poetry collections, books and blogs - none of it organized by date or session, in no particular order, and with no excerpts, just whole works. Some of this impossibly large collection of assignments was at Book Culture - I bought the books; we ended up never reading them. We were, however, apparently meant to read things that were out of print, unavailable from Butler, or from Book Culture, or anywhere in New York. Dabashi would say things like 'Isn't it all on the internet? You'll find it.' At any rate, that didn't really matter, because the class's absurd 'presentation' format meant we were never accountable for doing the reading anyway. \nThe class was entitled 'Film, Fiction, Poetry, History'. We spent about half the class on history and about half on film - or rather, on Dabashi's book about film, with no watching of the actual films, apparently. Fiction was barely skimmed over, poetry just did not happen, and the 'blog'/internet section we were meant to get to at the end obviously did not happen either. I was taking the class for fiction and poetry, which we just didn't do. On the second to last session, Dabashi expressed surprise at the date, and tried to get through about half the syllabus in the last class.\nIf I were convinced about a kernel of this man's supposed massive genius and well of knowledge it might have been OK, but he actually seemed to know nothing whatsoever and have the least sophisticated thought process of any prof or TA I've ever had.\nThe midterm paper was never graded, so the class has ended and I have no idea how I'm doing.\nThe sum of what Dabashi actually said during the class would probably fit on two sides of paper. He has 2 or 3 spiels that he trundles out, more or less verbatim, now and then, in extensive monologue, apparently without remembering that he has already said them. (Once, we spent about 20 minutes discussing a film scene and watched it in class; several sessions later, Dabashi brought up the scene apparently thinking it was entirely new to us, introduced it, and summarized the whole thing to make the same point.) These spiels can be found in his books, which he assigns. Neither sheds any light on the other, it's just more repetition. On the rare occasion that Dabashi manages to elicit a comment from a student, he tends to misunderstand it. His response is usually patronizing, and tends to consist of side-eyeing your supposedly problematic phraseology before launching in to rant A, B, or C, as outlined in one of his books. \nNEVER TAKE ANYTHING WITH THIS AWFUL MAN\nWorkload:\nLiterally nothing. I think it would be possible to not hand in any papers.\n"

            "review_content": "\nDabashi is arguably brilliant, as he seems to know everything about anything within his field and beyond it. The drawback, though, is that sometimes you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not sure if he might be BSing a little bit of it and being overblown in his own self-importance. Because Dabashi is fairly full of himself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dat least half of the assigned works on the syllabus were prefaced in class with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wrote this\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I inspired the filmmaker to make this,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d etc. Dabashi told us at the beginning of the semester that no question was a stupid question, but he then proceeded to make people terrified to speak by summarily shooting down some people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ideas that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with his own or that he thought were not terribly intelligent. Most of the class is based solely on his own ideas and opinions, no matter how much he claims to be adding in a lot of different perspectives.\nHalf the time, when Dabashi was lecturing, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even tell that this was a class on Islamic civilization. We talked about Kant and Habermas and other Western philosophy and political theory, and there was no real indication as to how we were supposed to connect it to the theme of Islamic civilization. Because Dabashi enjoyed talking about all of the off-topic topics so much, we got incredibly behind on the syllabus very quickly and never really discussed the last five or six items on the syllabus.\nThe workload for this class was completely unrealistic and absolutely murderous if you attempted to do every reading assigned. We generally had an entire book or movie (or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153selections\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of one, which generally meant about \u00c2\u00be of it) assigned for each class, but soon enough, I realized that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely necessary to read all of it. As the two big assignments of the class were papers that you could pick and choose among the assigned texts for, you could choose the texts that interested you and focus on getting a good handle on those (the only drawback to this approach was that if Dabashi randomly called on you to give a summary of the reading for that class\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich he did frequently\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand you hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read it, you were in the hot seat and subject to his public censure). On one day (two weeks before finals), when it became apparent that literally no one had watched the assigned movie for that class, he asked, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watching this movie over the last two days, what could you have possibly been doing?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe classic move of a professor who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize that we have classes other than his to worry about or might possibly need to have lives that are not 24/7 studying.\nBy the end of the semester, though, Dabashi lightened up a bit, because the only people left who still came to lecture were the ones who could deal with him. He even started joking a little bit with the ones of us he had come to know. But on the whole, the only thing to redeem Dabashi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shortcomings in this class was the fact that he clearly has a passion for the Middle East.\nMy TA, Sahar, however, was AMAZING. She was the shining light in the darkness that this class sometimes was. She knew so much about all of the topics the class covered (from what I saw, it seemed like she knew almost as much as Dabashi himself), and she, at least, made sure that we got through everything on the syllabus in our discussion section. She had a way of explaining things that made it all clear, and she always had suggestions for further reading or research\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtitles of countless relevant books and movies that she could just pull straight out of her head\u00e2\u20ac\u201dif a certain topic interested us. She was also extremely helpful in her office hours, and helped me work through all of my ideas for the final paper and gave me some tips as to what I could do better. She was always sunny and excited to teach, and got almost all of us in the section involved in and excited about the discussion by making us realize that the class material was actually really interesting and full of depth. Sahar was legitimately the one reason I was able to make it through this class with my sanity.\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking just to fulfill your global core requirement, I would recommend that you take this class (at least if Dabashi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teaching it; I get the sense that this class is much different when Saliba teaches it)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere are infinitely easier ways of getting that requirement.\n\nWorkload:\nMidterm essay (25%)\nFinal essay (50%)\nDiscussion section participation (25%)\n"

            "review_content": "\nI came into this class really looking forward to it. There were mixed reviews on CULPA, but I thought I was blown away during the first lecture. Dabahi walked around the room, talking about all of these super intellectual things. He went through the syllabus, explained the different books, and I was so intrigued. I was genuinely excited for the class.\nI was so, so wrong.\nDabash doesn't teach -- he let's the TAs present on the books, and then scribbles down loose notes on whatever he thinks up and then walks around the room, pontificating and making jokes. The TAs do all of the heavy lifting here, and he doesn't really explain what's going on. He just pontificates about Kant and tries to amaze the class with catchy phrases like \"We have to make the unfamiliar familiar by making the familiar unfamiliar.\" He gave us supposedly a book a lecture, but was so entrenched in his desire to pontificate that we quickly fell behind, and the TAs, who were responsible for telling us which parts of the books we were assigned, seemed to have given up around spring break, possibly because no one bothered to do the readings because *they didn't matter to the class.*\nMy TA, Sahar, was the only redeeming merit. She was clear, well-spoken, and actually made an effort to make the texts understandable, and she, at least, seemed to care more than Dabashi did.\nDon't do what I did, and fall for his theatrics and his talking points. The man is too busy thinking about how amazing he is, and doesn't really care about the class. If you're interested in this, wait until Saliba or someone else teaches the course in the future, or find a copy of the reading list and read the books yourself. They were the only redeeming merit of this course.\nWorkload:\nMidterm 5-page response paper (no citations needed) to one or two of the readings, and a 10-page research paper using the texts assigned on the syllabus (citations needed). There is basically a book a lecture, but you only have to read part of it (assuming the TAs are kind enough to tell you what you actually have to read). Discussion sections are mandatory.\n"

The readings for Theory and Culture are very interesting.  I thought this course could have been as valuable as CC, covering a wide range of canonical texts.  I did not anticipate Dabashi's incompetence as a lecturer.  He frequently missed class, and on one occasion waltzed in and asked the students what he was supposed to be lecturing about.  He is the classic case of a professor caught up in himself and academia, paying little attention to the--what's it called again--real world, which probably explains his obsession with the phrase \"fictive imagination.\"  That being said, he is clearly intelligent, and his lectures were occasionally interesting.  I just wished he actually focused on the texts instead of rambling about more or less the same thing every class.\nWorkload:\nNot bad.

I mean, come on, you have to actually PLAN the class ahead of time.  He enjoys cold-calling students, which is a valid method except he uses it more as a cautionary method of embarrassment (\"see what happens when you don't do everything I say\") than an actual teaching method.  He says he is open to any and all theories, but he is very discouraging of any actual dissenting opinion.\nUnfortunately, this class is required for students majoring in Comparative Literature.  If you are not a major, do yourself and the actual majors a favor: don't take this class.  You won't enjoy it and you will just crowd the class for the people who actually have to take it (Dabashi refuses to kick out the non-majors and the freshman who think it's an \"intro course,\" much to the chagrin of students who actually have to learn this material).\nWorkload:\nReadings that you don't have to do, but you should, because they're more valuable than his long, but substance-free, lectures.

It didn't help that he decided to take three whole weeks off and let his TAs, who did their best to substitute for him, run the course.\nI was put off by his personality (very haughty) and by his sweeping generalizations about american and european films. i will admit that he did (twice) deliver excellent lectures, but these were exceptions, and when he is in a good mood (again, hardly a trend) he can be approachable and even supportive. \nWorkload:\nthree main books (Sights of Vision; Close-Up; Subversive Pleasures; some short papers; recitation attendance; final paper\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Dabashi is by far the absolute worst professor i've had during my graduate career at Columbia, and that he manages to garner teaching accolades, attract groupies comprised of nubile undergraduates, and remains the chair of two departments despite sheer incompetence, arrogance, total lack of organization and general smarminess, I'm sure are signs that the four horsemen of the Apocolypse have just touched down, and will be galloping among us quite soon.\nFor all his dramatics and colorful metaphors, Dabashi is really himself what he enjoys calling his critics, \"a failed academic\".  Dabashi not only manages to avoid discussing intelligently or coherently the films he screens , he completely neglects to mention anything from any of the books he's assigned.  Instead he rambles incoherently about Hegel, Nietzsche and a host of other German philosophers who have nothing to do with this class.\n As a previous reviewer noted, Robert Stam's \"Subversive Pleasures\", was the only book worth buying, and frankly it was the only book from which i learned anything about film!!  Dabashi's assigns his own book (i wouldn't call it a book, actually- it's more like a large, badly written brochure) on Iranian cinema, entitled \"Close-Up\" ( the cover of which Orientalizes/exoticizes Muslim women by repeating the cliche of one in full burka, standing in a beam of light no less). If you are unfortunate enough to shell over $ for a copy and spend time reading it, you just confirm what you already knew before buying it: Dabashi doesn't really know much about Iranian cinema(or any cinema). He's just friends with alot of Iranians who happen to be world renown filmmakers and he enjoys cooing about them.  \nI could put up with all the patronizing and indignity in the world from any professor as long as i learned SOMETHING from him or her! Dabashi, however, is incapable of either formulating or inspiring any original thought, though he's quite fluent at speaking out of his 'arse'. If you catch him doing this, he will bring the full force of his tongue bearing down upon your sorry head. He has no respect or patience for opinions contradicting his own, no matter how well and respectfully articulated, and he has no time for his students outside the classroom.\nIt would be quite apt for him to one day screen \"The Wizard of Oz\" as he shares so much in common with the title character: flashy, moody, and full of hot air. Do not waste your money or time taking this class or any class by him.  \nWorkload:\nfour short papers; final paper; disorganized film screenings; absolutely no feedback from professor dabashi or his overworked TAs.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Dabashi is a brilliant man with little commitment for his students. Part of what makes him a fantastic lecturer is the depth to which he is entrenched in his own thought. This is also what makes him an ineffective teacher. All he can do, in his own words, is to take his students to the kitchen of his mind and to show them what's cooking. (The man's speech is full of incredible and often extended visual metaphors.) He is either incapable of or too lazy to listen to people who are either not on the same page as he is or don't particularly like the page that he is on.  His dismissals and his disinterestedness result in minimal participation by his students, even if the class is a senior or graduate seminar. Many very competent students I have spoken with came out of his classes feeling inadequate. This is unfair.\n[I disagree with the previous student's reading of the screening room incident in that I think the first student's remarks were misinterpreted. The second student's mistake was in her hasty reading of his remark, not in her reaction to the terrible thing she thought he had said. I agree that Dabashi overreacted massively by lashing out at her the way he did, silencing her for the rest of the semester. Foul.] \nBrilliant man. Bad listener.\nWorkload:\nOne 20-pg paper at the end of the semester. Again, I think it is lazy to grade your students on the basis of one assignment. I understand that Dabashi is a busy man, but he really ought to be able to give his students a little more of his energy. He is, after all, supposed to be a teacher. Waxing (incredibly) eloquent about how seriously you take your vocation as an educator does not make up for the fact that you do not take seriously your vocation as an educator. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class is my first Dabashi experience - and I have to say that despite the excellent screening list, I am sorely dissapointed.  While I have no problem admitting that he may indeed have a great knowledge of issues pertaining to colonialism (I hear that class is good)- when it comes to film, this professor is sorely lacking.  He throws about the term \"auteur\" with regard to the directors/films we are discussing - but if you begin a sentence with \"the director's intention could be...\" he shoots you down most contemptuously.  His goal in the course is to create a \"collective mind\" and has stated that even if your paper is of publishable material, if there is no evidence of the collective mind, \"you will not get a good grade.\"  Does this mean he is against individual thought?  I assume what he requires is to see his own misreadings and misinformed ideas on film regurgitated back to him in any paper we happen to produce - in order to get a \"good grade.\"  His overarching argument is that society is codified and that film is not.  Has he never heard of the term \"cinematic codes?\"  If cinema was not codefied, how would we be able to \"read\" films?  He makes sweeping statements such as, \"the sign of a true master director is when you don't notice the camera...\"  Kubrick and Godard are turning in their graves right now.  He patronizes the huge number of college students in this class, through comments like \"Foreign films have long shots and subtitles, and you will think them boring - there is no Hollywood/Swartzenneger action in them..\"  He makes his mind up about what is the be screened weekly - on a whim almost, on his way to class - even then...it may be a few days after class that we find out what next week's screening or reading is!  If you know absolutely nothing about film, you will still be in the dark after taking this class - other than the fact that you will see some great films that you might not have exposure to otherwise.  (but again - this class will try and force you to \"read\" these films in the \"Dabashi way\" - as if you interpret them in an alternate way - he won't want to hear about it!)   If you have only a mild interest in film, you may do ok - but you HAVE to have some sort of prior knowledge to be able to realize that most of his film-related comments are misinformed.  My heart goes out to the TAs who, due to the class size, are forced to have to deal with all the complaints about the disorganization - which really has nothing to do with them.\nWorkload:\nOnly 3 books to buy - Robert Stam's book SUBVERSIVE PLEASURES is excellent - but don't expect to get anything out of the discussion sections.  2 required papers - 5-8 pages - not one word over 8 pages will be read (a shame - but probably due to enormous size of class)  Response paper due to TA before every class on the film viewed that week. (as of yet, no feedback on them)\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Dabashi does incredible work for the world and the community except when it comes to his teaching. He arrived to class 10-15 minutes late each session and consistently let us out ten minutes late. We read one book per week and discussed the book for approximatey five minutes every class, though he chose to subject an unsuspecting student to giving a well-reasoned argument and synopsis of the book at the beginning of each class. His syllabus included several books which were out of print and many he chose to remove after we purchased them. If a student chose to disagree with his Marxist conception of the definition of colonialism \"the abuse of labor by capital\" (also known as capitalism) you would be ridiculed and ignored. He frequently had arguments with students about films and books not assigned for the course (Kant, Adorno & Horkheimer, the film \"the battle of algiers\"). His classes follow no structure whatsoever and he makes leaps in the conversation by telling stories which are only mildly relevant to the topic of discussion. Sometimes it is difficult to be sure what he is actually talking about. He also made us come to a film screening and discussion for two hours every wednesday night, doubling the amount of classtime. During one such meeting, a student made an unbearably misogynist comment which amounted to \"one can tell that a woman has been raped if there is some indication of sexual pleasure.\" A young woman in the class was offended and said so, asking the young man to refrain from such doltish and offensive commenting.The ever-so-progressive Dabashi screamed at her for asserting her right not to listen to that sort of offensive and violent language in the classroom. The professor was extremely condescending to her. This sort of behavior is indicative of the general Dabashi way, which appears progressive and yet is so completely egoistic and control-bound that you won't learn a thing by questioning. Famous Professors often suffer from these groupie diseases, it becomes a disservice to their work and their students. The grades reflect only the degree to which you agree with everything he says and grovel at the Dabashi altar. \nWorkload:\nOne book per week and a 2 hr film screening each week. One 15 page term paper based on \"statistical evidence\" he will not direct you to find. Also, a constant barrage on one's dignity.\n"

Anyone hoping to learn something about the films or the cultural contexts in which they were produced will be sorely disappointed. Dabashi's lectures are unresearched, unsubstantive, and largely free-associative; often, a student will ask a question and change the course of the entire lecture. Topics covered include Kant, Sartre (neither of whom is on the syllabus), Hamid Dabashi's Traffic Light Theory, Hamid Dabashi's Gas Station Theory, Hamid Dabashi's Amir's Falafel Theory, and Hamid Dabashi's Knife and Fork Theory of Civilization, which states that humans were able to establish civilizations because, unlike cats, they have opposable thumbs. He'll occasionally mention one of the films you've watched, usually only to proclaim that it is a masterpiece and leave it at that. He never brings up the reading, much of which (\"Sites of Vision,\" for instance) is on the syllabus for reasons only he can understand. It may not be hard, but the class is a painful and frustrating time-waster. Avoid it at all costs.\nWorkload:\nTwo 4-6 page papers, a pointless and unhelpful discussion section, a screening section, and a good deal of unnecessary and often incoherent reading. (Viola Shafiq's book \"Arab Cinema,\" Ella Shohat's book \"Israeli Cinema,\" and Dabashi's own book \"Close Up\" are pretty good, but he never talks about them.) Good luck figuring out what the paper topics are -- Dabashi and the TAs often seemed at odds when it came to both the assignments and the due dates. I will undoubtedly be pegged as a vindictive student, but I got an A.\n"
