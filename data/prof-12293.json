If you try and talk to him he will get offended and will attempt to make you feel dumb. Don't be fooled. His discussion section varies in efficiency... it's always awkward compared to the other discussion sections. He's rarely in class so he has no idea what Jervis said in lecture. Overall not a nice person to talk to. He needs to get off his high horse and smell the shit that he is shoveling. \nWorkload:\nHe's a TA so he gives no works.\n"
