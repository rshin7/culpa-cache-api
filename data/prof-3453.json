            "review_content": "\nNetwork Lab sucks, but it doesn't totally suck. Baset's lectures are beyond worthless (he's barely audible and doesn't cover relevant material), and the labs are EXTREMELY frustrating and repetitive. But you do learn some actual skills... I'm legitimately smarter for having taken this class.\nBut it ate up my time and gave me an ulcer from doing endless, monotonous network tasks. It's sort of like being a real-life network person. Ow, my stomach.\nYou can do a final project instead of taking a final exam, which isn't a bad idea, although the projects are really poorly stated and vague, and we found his expectations had changed a lot from the terse description he'd given us. Still, it was tolerable.\nWorkload:\nTen labs, with quick prelabs and LONG group reports (a lot of ours were 60+ pages; although a lot was debug output, it was still a ton of writing; even trading them off, they ate up lots of time. A few brief homework assignments thrown in now and then.\n"
