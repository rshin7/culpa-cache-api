She teaches by the book (or her notes, rather). Doesn't help to clarity concepts for the confused students, only confuses the problem further. Can't do basic algebra.\nGulati's lectures however are great.\nWorkload: 1 hour/week. I still went to all of them (she often ends the section early), though I hardly learnt anything. All you hear is stupid people conversing.\nWorkload:\nMinimal. No homework. All \"math\" problems done in the room.\n"
