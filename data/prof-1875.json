In my opinion, he has a very friendly camouflage in the class, but once he finds out that you are discussing lab reports with your partner, your final grade in that course will be around C- or F.  Just think twice when you meet that guy in your class, how could you avoid discussing how to write a lab report with your lab partner? He thinks that independent report work can be carried on after dependent lab work. \n"
