            "review_content": "\nRandy is a wonderful, charming professor and I thoroughly enjoyed both classes I took with him this semester. His lectures consist of easy to follow (although not posted) powerpoints, with added commentary and explanations. Sometimes the lectures can get a little too theoretical or outright boring, but Professor Balmer is often outwardly apologetic about this and really tries to make the lectures interesting. He is a seriously respected scholar in the field of American religion, so you'll be able to get some really detailed information about some of the topics with which he's worked the most. He's always willing to see students during office hours.\nYou WILL NOT PASS this class if you do not do the reading. He pulls many multiple-choice and short answer questions on exams directly from the reading. The reading is usually directly related to what is discussed in lecture. Some books are painfully boring but on the whole they're not that bad. Missing lecture isn't the worst thing, but make sure you get detailed notes from someone else.\nIn the past, Professor Balmer gave out study guides prior to midterm and final exams, but as of Fall 2011 he has ended that practice. He made the midterms way too tricky for both classes. As a response to students' grief over their bad midterm grades, he offered the class the option to double their final exam grade if they completed a 2-page review of one of the class texts. This proved to be an AMAZING option, since the final was significantly easier than the midterm and if you studied, there was no reason not to do well. \nWorkload:\nSomewhere between 50 and 200 pages a week. More often a few chapters of a book than an entire book at once. \nReligion in America: Two 4-6 page response papers (topics posted 1-2 weeks in advance), 40 points each. Midterm exam 45 points. Final exam, 45 points. Discussion (Pop up discussion class every few weeks. Attendance is what counts.), 30 points.\nEvangelicalism: Research paper - proposal, 10 points; paper 70 points. Midterm exam, 60 points. Final Exam, 60 points. Discussion (Pop up discussion class every few weeks. Attendance is what counts.), 30 points. \n"

            "review_content": "\nFirst, I have to make it clear that Professor Balmer is one of the most genuinely nice people I have had the privilege to meet. He is always available via email or during office hours, is incredibly accommodating, and is always willing to hear you out and help you in whatever way he can. \nThat being said, I was extremely disappointed with this class. It had the potential to be really great, but unfortunately a few things sidetracked our ability to get through the syllabus. First, though this was a strict lecture course, Balmer would repeatedly spend at least half of each class fielding questions and listening to irrelevant personal anecdotes from students. While I think it's great that he was able to facilitate discussion, it's also the professor's job to know when to tell students to see him after class so he is able to finish teaching the material for the day. Second, one of the class assignments was to create a powerpoint and present it to the class. While this assignment could have been successful in a much smaller class, it was a terrible idea in a class of 60+ students, and because of the presentations not only did we not get through most of the syllabus, but what we did cover, we had to rush through with barely any analysis. \nIt's important to keep in mind though that this was Balmer's first time teaching this class, so if/when he decides to teach it again, he may change some of the assignments, etc. Also, if you are simply dying to take a Balmer class, do yourself a favor and take Religion and the Civil Rights Movement. That class is a dream.\nWorkload:\nmidterm and final (noncumulative)... the multiple choice is tricky, but doable\none 4-6 page paper\nchoice of doing either the class presentation or writing a 5 pg book review\n"

Religion in American Culture I was very well structured, the material was interesting, the workload was very reasonable, and I have never meet anyone more enthusiastic about their subject matter than Randall Balmer.  He is always full of stories, and wants to make sure he has earned the class's attention.  Class was always thought provoking and I can't wait to take Religion in American Culture II.  He is also a very reasonable and kind person when it comes to individual problems.  \nThe readings are interesting, but not a necessity.  He has all the information he wants you to know on power point slides, but he won't test you on the details, so don't bother writing everything down.  I thoroughly enjoyed this class and think Randall Balmer is a great teacher!\nWorkload:\nfree points for \"participation\" (10%), and there were two 4-6 page papers that are graded very generously (20% each), a midterm (25%), and a final (25%).

It was really interesting though, so a lot of the reading was easy to get through.  Everything we learned was really interesting.

The minimal amount of reading (almost all at least co-authored by Balmer) meant that it was really a course on Balmer's view of American religious history. Each day consisted of him flipping through powerpoint slides, waiting as the class copied down names and dates, and then reading the contents of the slides more or less verbatim. He presents US religious history as a serious of bullet points. This felt like a high school class. Sparse on analysis, heavy on apologies whenever he happened to accidentally overburden us with 'too much theology.' Never mind that this is a religion course. Intellectual lightweight is correct. Academic disappointment. \nWorkload:\nMinimal reading, almost all from his book. 2 4-6 page papers on simple topics. Midterm and final with multiple choice and matching sections.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class was most definitely a survey of American religious history from colonization through the Civil War.  As such, we covered a lot of ground only sometimes in depth, I learned a lot, and it was very easy.  Professor Balmer's greatest fear (as he demonstrates with repeated apologies for his lack of up-to-date humor or for his hilarious anecdotes that he's sure no one will be interested in) is that the class will be bored or overworked.  I thought he was hilarious in that kind of awkward, professorial kind of way.  At the same time, he knows all about American religious history, and if he doesn't have a full answer to a question, he will research it and give a better answer in the next class.  \nClasses consisted of powerpoint lectures that are not posted online, so take notes!  Luckily, Professor Balmer goes very slowly, leaving plenty of time to copy out almost every slide in full (not that you'll need that much detail for the exams, but it comes useful in papers and is interesting).  On top of going so slowly, class was almost always let out 15 minutes early, so I never had to sprint to my next class.  \nThere were two 4-6 page papers, graded by TAs who seemed to have no role but grading these papers (no discussion section), with given topics.  The midterm and final both have three sections: multiple choice, match the term with the answer (in lieu of writing IDs), and an essay question or two.  Again, easy.  Weekly reading was important for the exams and for the papers, and ranged anywhere from 20-150 pages per week, though only a few times did it hit 150 pages, and those books were easy to read. \nWorkload:\n20-150 pages reading per week (you need to read the books that keep coming up in the syllabus, as well as some of the smaller ones, but you don't have to do everything).  2 4-6 page papers.

The reading is a bit much but it's interesting. I highly recommend this man--he really cares about his students. This semester there were about 90 of us in the lecture and he stayed after class answering question after question after question, beaming at the students as they passed. And what an interesting guy! He sometimes goes off on little tangents about his books or his documentary, which is pretty cool because he's Emmy award-winning.\nBalmer is great about multimedia-style presentation as well. We watched some really cool documentaries and read some amazing books. Howard Thurman's \"Jesus and the Disinherited\" was hugely impactful--if you skim through any of the other books, read this one!! It's paradigm-changing, to say the least.\nWatch out for his essays. The prompts are really general and you'll end up having to do tons of research on a topic minutely related to the prompt in order to get an A. The last paper, a \"reflection\" on how this class had affected, if at all, our understanding of history or religion, was graded like a research paper, not a personal reflection. This is probably more of a TA issue though...\nYay this class! Take it! It's awesome!\nWorkload:\nHeavy reading--2 huge biographies, 3 shorter books (150-300 pages), a good deal of historical documents. 2 essays, midterm isn't that bad, and a final.\n"

He was able to elucidate the main facts and themes of American evangelicalism in a way that seemed to strike the right note with everyone in the class.  He was also extremely friendly and helpful in office hours when I went to talk to him.\nOn the other hand, I didn't find his presentation of the material challenging at all.  In part this may have been due to the fact that we didn't have too many thought-\nprovoking discussions, in which his main points were challenged or a different perspective offered.  Also, there are times when you will think you're back in high school-- movies, excessive power point (where everyone proceeds to copy down every single word that is on the screen and thereby delay the class), and really, really easy exams.  The most challenging part of the course was the research paper, which I found very worthwhile.\nOverall, I do recommend this class if you are interested in American religious history.  You'll learn and probably enjoy yourself.\n\nWorkload:\nEasy- 1 research paper, midterm, (non-cumulative) final.  The exams were mostly multiple choice with a few IDs.\n"

At least half the class Prof. Balmer simply came in, started the VCR, and allowed two or three minutes at the end for questions. When he did lecture, the content was either very simplistic or simply factually incorrect. The TA's were little better. They would raise their hands to answer questions (you're a TA, put your hand down) and then would answer them wrong. The final exam was an exercise in nitpicking. Instead of looking at the broad themes of the civil rights movement, he asked questions about who said specific quotes that were never talked about in class and mentioned in passing in the readings. That said, I got an A- for minimum work. It's just a terribly thought out and lazily executed way of approaching a very interesting topic. For shame, Prof. Balmer.

I'd say in about 2/3 of the classes he could have been making the stuff up as he went along, and the remainder of the sessions Balmer screened movies, not because they told us something earth-shattering (which they didn't) but because his lazy ass wanted to avoid giving a lecture. The outside speakers he brought in were all more interested in advancing their own parochial agendas than telling us anything of value. I wasted a lot of $$ and burned some shoe leather trekking to the Hungarian on weekends to hunker down and finish the ridiculously repetitive books he assigned. I only did the readings because, since the exams are all IDs, you cannot skim to get the general concepts, but instead you must read every word and be on the lookout for words thrown in here and there that might POSSIBLY make it onto a test. Finally, he bent over backwards to allow students to waste the time with idiotic questions that belong back in the 3rd grade. At the end of the course, I felt used like a cheap whore - because I'd allowed this guy to waste so much of my time. After class every day, I quite literally regretted having attended, because sleeping in would have been a better use of my time. One of the biggest academic disappointments I've had. Avoid this guy.\nWorkload:\nEither 2 \"response\" papers or 1 longer research paper; midterm and final. There's a twist to his grading policy which he won't disclose until the last week of class, but since no one has put it up yet, I'm going to blow his cover: He'll let you double your grade from one exam and drop your grade from the other. That is, if you do well on the midterm, you can simply skip the final; or if you do poorly, a bang-up job on the final can make everything right. Simply put, no need to work that hard.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI came into this class wanting to take a class for my American Studies major, an Atheist with no previous interest or knowledge of religion and no real desire to study it, and left as a Religion minor with Balmer as my major advisor.  It was by far my favorite class and a treat to attend everyday.  It was my first class of the day and I hate waking up; furthermore, all the notes are presented on powerpoint (easy to take down!) which makes copying them from others easy--that being said, I still never missed a class.  It was everything that could be interesting about American religion compiled into one class... we studied some broad topics but mainly the class was focused on interesting tidbits that Balmer deftly explained with interesting anecdotes from his own in-depth study of the topic.  The material was simply fascinating, and in general the TA's brought a lot to the discussion as well and their absence was even felt during the week-long strike in April (though sometimes they did carry on too many irrelevant personal conversations with Balmer during class).\nThere are 4 units (sort of five, we didn't finish--more on that later) and you get to pick 2 to do a paper on, which is nice because you don't have to write on something if it bores you.  You can also choose to do one research paper in lieu of the two, shorter unit papers.  I loved the lectures but I have some qualms about the organization of the class... sometimes the material of the unit didn't really fit together, which made writing a paper on the unit difficult.  This was particularly evident with the unit on immigrants, because there was material on immigrants spanning two units.  Also, we didn't really come close to finishing the material on the syllabus, which is a shame because it all seemed so interesting.  The guest (a Native American woman and Jewish rabbi) lectures were both a waste of time but, to his credit, they were both impromptu as they had called Balmer that morning and I don't think he'd known how they were going to go.  Also, some of the books weren't very good (\"The Secret World of Penitentes,\" a topic in which I was very interested, was so bad that I actually couldn't force myself to finish reading the horrific writing).  But take this class for the lecture and you'll enjoy yourself immensely.\nThere is an in-class midterm and final, both of which are VERY heavily memorization-based.  Fortunately, they eliminated multiple choice on the final, which made it a lot easier since you're studying for the ID's anyway (he gives you the list of possible ID's ahead of time), and Balmer lets you double either your midterm grade or your final grade (if you so choose).  However, it is still difficult to memorize 50 VERY detailed paragraphs worth of material, and if you leave off minor details you will get marked off (you have to write EXACTLY what the TA's are looking for).  This has drawbacks and benefits, but since it really comes down to how much time you're willing to put into studying for the test, you are truly in control of your grade and if you study you will get an A.  I recommend trying really hard on the midterm because if your grade is good enough it will be one less final to study for come finals week.  The rest of the class though is basically no work... you are supposed to read the books at your leisure and have them completed by the end of the unit, however if you are not writing a paper on the unit you don't really need to, since if they're going to be on the final you'll know from the list of ID's he gives you.  However, some of the books were interesting and I kind of filed them under my \"read for pleasure if I have time\" category.\nAll told, I highly recommend this class as a very interesting introduction to a (who knew?) fascinating topic that is very relevant today.  Balmer is a captivating. charismatic lecturer who has good material to work with.  Really, the class was just plain fun, and I am doing whatever I can to make sure I take as many classes with Balmer as I am able to do at Barnard!\nWorkload:\nVery light--2 papers of 6-8 pages which are fairly easy and based on however much reading you want to do for them (skimming one book could be good enough to write the paper).  1-2 books are assigned for each unit (5 in total) but the reading is rarely necessary... only to answer the ID's on the tests but he gives you the list beforehand so you'll be prepared anyway.  Extra credit is available on both the midterm and final, and you can substitute either grade for the other.  All tests and papers are worth 20 points each, for a total of 80 points.  The grading on papers varies by TA... my papers were about equally good and one got a 40 while the other one got a 34 (which is a B and therefore a pretty low grade).  If nothing else, this class is an easy A- if you just apply yourself a little bit and an easy A with some effort when writing the 2 papers and taking the test (you only have to do well on one since it's doubled!)\n"

Every day was the same ordeal: walk into class, listen to Balmer make fun of and trivialize various different religious traditions, copy down pages of notes directly from a power point presentation, and listen to rabid TAs interrupt to give their own somewhat related perspectives.  Simply awful.  There was no general theme tying any of the units together (aside from, perhaps, \"these guys are nuts too!\"), the final & midterm were merely memory tests, and the books assigned were generally poorly-written and boring -- one of which was Balmer's own, which you got to read & then watch a movie version of in class.  That said, I really think Balmer is a genuinely nice guy and he's certainly well-known in his field.

            "review_content": "\nI cannot praise Professor Balmer enough!!  Not only is he one of the best lecturers I have ever had, but he is undoubtedly the most approachable. While grading can get tricky because his TA's are often very very picky, grammatically-oriented, and subjective, he is more than willing to meet with a student and review your work if you have a case. He is very personable, inserts wit and humor into his lectures (which admittedly can get very repetitive very quickly), and really knows and explains his stuff well. I would recommend taking anything you can with Balmer!\nWorkload:\nTons of reading- in theory. You dont really have to do any of it, as he will cover it in his comprehensive lectures. He uses slideshows for the majority, interspersed with video presentations to keep it interested. A few short papers (graded harshly by TAs) and SUPER easy midterm and final if you show up to class and listen (which isnt hard considering that hes terrific). \n"

When someone received a grade below a B+, it is an ingrained reflex that the TA is down right mean.  Please!  Get over yourselves.  The midterm is IDs which apparently, I did not realize, are hard?  I thought not.  Take this class if you're interested in religion, but don't be turned off by these whiney reviews.  He's a great professor with a great class!\nWorkload:\ngo to class, listen, study, read. you'll be fine.  i found the midterm/final easy because i did those.  i wrote the 20 pg research paper, graded by balmer, and was pleased.\n"

            "review_content": "\nSimply put, this man is brilliant and teaches some fantastic courses. The common complaint among the detractors on this site seems to be that he doesn't grade his own papers. This is true, but it hardly takes away from the experience of hearing one of the leading scholars in American religion lecture twice a week. If you are not interested in American religion (particularly American Christianity and evangelicalism, since that is where Balmer has done most of his groundbreaking work), you will not enjoy this class. However, if you are a religion major or have more than a passing interest in the state of religion in America, the class is a must. His credentials as a researcher in this field are nearly unrivaled, and he is passionate about teaching undergraduates. For those people who think he is arrogant or disinterested, try demonstrating genuine interest in what he's saying. I once went to his office hours to ask about a paper and ended up talking about Bush and religion for about an hour because he was so glad to see a student who actually cared about what he was talking about. Don't take the class for an easy 'A'; it's an insult to a great professor. Take it because you'll learn something from one of the greatest Columbia has to offer.\nWorkload:\nrelatively mild: easy final and midterm, several short papers on topics of your choice--a chance for students to explore their own interests, so there shouldn't be many complaints.\n"

Week after unbearable week I scribbled his immaculately organized PowerPoint presentations into my notes while languishing bored by his total dullness, and stark lack of analysis. Lectures read like the driest textbook, \"In 1900 this happened, 1902 this event.... blah blah blah blah.\"  He had impressive credentials for sure but threw on a video (staring him) instead of lecturing on the topics of his expertise.  He never read any papers (a TA-only job) and never once did I find comments explaining my grades.  I've heard all sorts of horrors about his grading and fared pretty well at first. I got overall good grades (all A's) on all assignments until one.  Unfortunately, on one occasion personal matters conflicted with a due date and Prof. Balmer made an already shitty situation so so so much worse by being totally inflexible, unavailable and just plain mean. I managed to turn in a pretty good paper late (which really wasn\u00c2\u2019t so bad considering the circumstances). On account of the tardiness of one response paper he thought it appropriate to drastically cut my final grade from an \u00c2\u201cA\u00c2\u201d to a \"D\".  Grrrrrr.  So um basically..... DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS IF YOU HAVE HALF A BRAIN AND WANT TO DO MORE THAN MEMORIZE DATES!!!! (and if you do enroll pray for a tranquil personal life) \nWorkload:\nthree 8-page response papers or one long research paper, difficult midterm and final exam. \n"

My one BIG complaint is that he is quite arrogant, which I find to be completely inappropriate when teaching undergraduates. He assumes knowledge and then acts surprise when you don't know everything about the history of religion in America. Be prepared for this attitude -- it is quite infuriating.

I don't think he touched a single paper or exam anyone in the class handed in - didn't read any of them or even verify the grade.  The TAs graded everything, and they were rather unpredictable and in one case, downright mean about the comments.  I was so frustrated and hurt by one particular TA's comment on a paper I threw it out in the nearest trash can -- they were utterly unhelpful and bordered on being personal.  I found it hard to keep up my enthusiasm for the course when I realized neither professor nor TA cared who their students were nor how they were doing.\nWorkload:\nI found it to be a little excessive - 4 papers 4-8 pps (one optional), in-class midterm and final (easy).\n"

It bothered me that some topics were rushed through, but, I can't blame the guy for trying to fit all of pre-Civil War American religious history into a semester. \nOverall, he does a fanastic job and will keep you very much interested. \nWorkload:\nNot too bad. The readings were somewhat excessive, but not entirely necesary. A short 40 minute midterm (they give you the IDs ahead of time!), three 4-8 page papers, and an easy, noncumulative final. You won't be struggling to get an A in this class, either. If you do the work, and at least some of the reading, it's easy as peas. \n"

The class also suffers from the greatest inherent problem of colloquiums, i.e. the success of the class is largely dependent on your classmates. Suffice it to say that mine wasn't too successful.\nWorkload:\nA book a week, one presentation, and a 17 page research paper.\n"
