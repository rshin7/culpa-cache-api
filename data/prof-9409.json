            "review_content": "\nFilm & Feminism/Theorizing Diaspora - a class co-taught by Prof. Tina Campt and Prof. May Joseph - was by far the best course I've taken in my college career, largely because of the professors. Prof. Campt is obviously invested in her students, encouraging everyone to participate in class discussions. Luckily, when I took the class there were only eight of us, so it was possible for everyone to fully engage in class. Campt's love of diasporic theory and visual culture is the driving force behind this class made even more powerful when coupled with Prof. Joseph's passion of film and film history. The films we watched were beautiful and challenging (Daughters of the Dust, Sugar Cane Alley, Black Girl...), and the readings were equally potent. I've told everyone that they should take this course, and I truly believe that. The class - and Prof. Campt - changed the way I talk about movement and think about film. \nWorkload:\nReading every week (usually around 40 pages), three page reviews of those readings five times, an in-class presentation on one week's readings & film coupled with a five page paper analyzing the film, a 12 minute final film project, and an 8-10 page paper discussing your film.\nYes, it is a lot. Yes, it does sound intimidating. But the professors do an amazing job of working with you to make it all possible, and catering the papers and projects to you and your own academic interests. And, in all fairness, Prof. Campt recognizes how much work this is and mentioned she will lessen the workload for the next class.\n"
