He's a really understanding guy and is very reasonable. However, classroom discussions can definitely get dull. I would say it's an easier section of CC compared to what I've heard from others.  Not a bad section to be in, but also didn't get me very excited about the texts.  Grading is very reasonable.\nWorkload:\nFair to less than average\n"
