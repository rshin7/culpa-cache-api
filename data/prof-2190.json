            "review_content": "\nI loved loved loved this professor.  He is incredibly clear, a fantastic lecturer, is very approachable (always willing to meet with you) and has a great sense of humor.  Although this class was early in the morning, I never felt tired or bored.  There were many concepts such as some of the international trade models I did not understand in other class that I got after 20 minutes with Professor Weinstein.  He also goes over a couple of finance concepts (the economics of a repurchase agreement, the idea of short selling etc) that I found useful.  I personally enjoyed the economic components of his lectures more, but was a little less interested in the history.\nIn total, amazing professor.  Take this class!!\nWorkload:\nHe assigns a lot of reading, but goes over most of them in class (most of the reading is also very interesting).  The midterm/final are largely based on the lectures.  I found them both to be pretty challenging (you need to pay a lot of attention in class and make sure you completely understand each concept he covers).  A final paper on a topic of your choice (I learned a great deal from it.  He is always willing to help you and I had an awesome TA (Jessie) that was also very helpful. But make sure you start early.  It is a ton of work and would be impossible to do last minute).\nIt is definitely not an easy class and I thought it was pretty tough, but it was 100% worth it.  He is also a very fair grader\n"

            "review_content": "\nWeinstein is a great guy; he's a very passionate and strong lecturer, and makes some hilarious jokes. He tries his best to make the class enjoyable, and generally succeeded. I'd venture to guess that almost anyone who doesn't hate economics will enjoy this class. There are readings, all of which I did pre-midterm, but once I found that they weren't really that exciting or that relevant to class material/tests, I stopped. Still, I recommend reading from the Modern History book. It's really interesting. \nThe paper at the end is difficult, and can seem very overwhelming. Do start a bit early, and meet with Weinstein repeatedly until you feel like you know what you're doing. He's extremely helpful when it comes to finding sources, thinking about topics, etc. Seems like a legitimately cool guy.\nTests are not easy, but certainly not hard. Study a bit, go over the mathematical derivations and the slides, and you'll be fine.\nI wasn't a huge fan of the class participation component of the grade - it seems to favor either the students who were extremely well-educated on the topic or the students who were willing to say absolutely anything to get a higher grade. But it's really not the biggest deal. He asks some painfully easy questions in class, presumably to help those who want participation credit but don't know much economics/Japan history.\nIn sum - highly recommend. Very fascinating material (most of it), and great professor. Hard at times, but well worth it.\nWorkload:\nThere really isn't any, unless you wish to obsess over the readings. \n"

            "review_content": "\nWeinstein is a very good professor, a strong lecturer, and a genuinely nice man. His class is a 50/50 blend of Japanese history and economic application, with a focus on history in the first half of the course. His lectures are all structured and run off a powerpoint, but he will occasionally draw a graph or equation on the board, and what he writes is often the most important in terms of what might show up on a test. \nPersonally, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the material that exciting, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this class pretends to be teaching you anything groundbreaking or unique \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a history class with graphs. It is certainly not an easy class, but unlike classes that are just impossible for the sake of it, there is about as direct a correlation as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in terms of work/effort to one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grade. The midterm/final are difficult, but fair (54/77 was the median, whatever that comes out to). The bulk of the grade for the class comes from a 2500-3000 word research essay in which he asks you to develop a question from primary data, and structure an argument/try to answer that question. Not an easy paper to write, but if you find a topic that you find interesting (and most importantly, has a lot of primary data), it can sort of write itself.\nThis was not one of my favorite econ electives, but it was a solid one nonetheless. I really respect Weinstein as a passionate lecturer and very intelligent guy. I would recommend it to those with interest in Japan (obviously\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6), or the history of economics. \n\nWorkload:\nReadings, but not required, and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show up on exams. 10% participation component\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 asks for your name every time you answer a question, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funny how every time, right after he calls on you, like clockwork \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uh, um, ok, and can you uh\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 oh I forgot it! Can you tell me your name?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ah yes! \u00e2\u20ac\u009d \nAnyway, midterm (fair- 20%) final (fair- 30%) paper (40%- get out of it what you put into it) participation (10%)\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nEconomic Development of Japan was probably one of the best economics classes I have taken at Columbia. Weinstein explains the material very well, and his lectures are lively enough to keep even a hungover senior such as myself engaged at 9am on a Thursday morning. \nThere is assigned reading, but virtually none of it is tested. The one piece of advice I would give to prospective students is that it is very important to actually show up to class, because he covers models on the blackboard that aren't included in the powerpoint notes. The exams focus heavily on this material, so if you try to just rely on the class notes, you are in for some trouble. \nThe paper is something of an ordeal (it counts for 40% of your grade), but because Professor Weinstein is actually willing to take the time to help you find a good topic, you actually end up learning something from the whole exercise. \nIn summary, this is a great class and I encourage every economics student to take it. The Japanese economy is very different from our own, and this is one of the few classes at Columbia that I can honestly say I got something out of. \nWorkload:\nMidterm (difficulty - fair), Final (difficulty - fair), Paper (you can make of it what you want, but the correlation between effort and grading is high)\n"

Professor Weinstein\u00c2\u2019s lectures are very organized and he is fairly entertaining. The first half of the semester mixes a lot of history in with economic theory, while the second half is much less historically driven. Professor Weinstein himself is a very nice and approachable guy and anxious to help.  The readings are fairly light and not particularly important compared to going to class.  The exams can be somewhat difficult, especially if you get lulled into not paying attention by the power points.  However if you go to class and pay attention they\u00c2\u2019re not too bad and they are curved to a high B low B+ just like every other Columbia econ course.  \nWorkload:\nLow-medium: midterm, final 10-12 page paper.  Fairly light reading.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Weinstein is obviously very passionate about Japan and Japanese economics including the history behind its development. He has had actual work experience in Japan so he knows first-hand how the labor markets function. He uses powerpoint to limit the amount of notes you have to take which makes it easy to just sit there and actually listen to what he has to say. His class is very interesting, I was loving it, I studied hard for the midterm and was still surprised how difficult I found the test to be... the curve worked in everyone's favor however. Overall I recommend the class because I think he's a great professor (and the nicest guy too) and the class material is interesting.\nWorkload:\nMidterm, final, one research paper 8-10 pages. Readings for every class but of very reasonable lengths (10-30 pages per class).\n"
