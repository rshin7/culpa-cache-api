The material is interesting, sometimes fascinating, and even reading the textbook is not bad. I think my problem with it is that it is very much a survey class- you learn about a lot of different disorders but do not go very much in depth for any of them. I also already knew a lot of the information presented, partly from common knowledge and partly from personal interest. Rafaeli seems like a very nice guy, doesn't mind answering questions, and includes details from his work as a therapist.\nWorkload:\nFair amount of reading, 3 exams (quite easy if you review the powerpoints and read the textbook, the lowest exam grade is dropped), final, and 3 extra credit assignments. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI really enjoyed this class, both because of the intense nature of our weekly discussions and the gentle but firm guidance of Professor Rafaeli. I went to his office hours quite a few times during the semester, sometimes to talk about the class material and sometimes to discuss the final paper (a 10-15 page proposal for a psych experiment), and found him to be patient and warm. During class, he struck a good balance between shaping the discussion and letting our individual voices come to the fore. My favorite part of the class (aside from the great readings, many penned by him) was the fact that each student served as the discussion leader during one class, so that each week's class seemed fresh and new. \nWorkload:\nweekly (1-page) response papers, draft proposal midway through the semester, final proposal (10-15 pages, double-spaced), weekly reading (4-5 articles/papers, each 15-20 pages long \u00e2\u20ac\u201d being science papers, were highly skim-able) \n"

His tests were great considering that we could make up our own questions, post them on courseworks, and then expect to see about half of them on the test. However, just like with abnormal, you have to know every detail of the textbook -otherwise, missing those few questions that come from one-liners in the book can really hurt your grade. It is sort of annoying to have to study a huge textbook so hard only to see it come up in about 5 questions on the whole test. If you are willing to do this though, then I would say definately take the class. But beware, he likes to keep class going about 5-10 min. after it is supposed to be over.  \nWorkload:\n2 midterms, 1 cumulative final, 3 assignments.\n"

He genuinely wants you to understand the material. He will throw in role plays to get you to fully explore all aspects of abnormal psych. He teaches you how to approach diagnosis, how to ask questions, and how to differentiate one disorder from the other in very memorable ways. If you go to lecture, you will do fine on the exams. He makes things memorable. He throws in questions from the text just to make sure you read along, but what professor doesn't? He is completely receptive to all questions/comments.  He is such a nice guy, you can go to him for anything, and he is more than happy to accomodate. All in all, he is amazing, and I loved this class! I will definately take another class with him! \nWorkload:\nGo to class - skim the reading...3 exams, and he drops the lowest! You don't even have to take one if you're happy with your first two! Very easy to manage. \n"

He posts all lecture notes online and if you read the textbook with lecture notes in hand before the test, it is all very straightforward. Not to mention the \"extra credit\" assignments that can boost every test grade, so that the max is always 107-8. Awesome. \nIf this class were not consistently at 9am students probably wouldn't skip it as much. But as it is, it doesn't really matter because attending class is not at all a predictor of your final grade if you are capable of teaching yourself in any way. \nWorkload:\n3 midterms (he drops the lowest grade of these three), a final. three \"assignments\" that turn into extra credit on the tests and are optional to turn in. \n"

Although the topic lends itself to interesting theoretical questions, he really encourages participation and debate. There tend to be a lot of weirdos in the class who sometimes dominate the conversation with their incessant need to express every opinion they ever had, but they can be entertaining in their own way. I highly recommend the class for anyone interested in therapy and clinical psych. Rafaeli is enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and presents thought-provoking material. It's certainly possible to do well without coming to class, but Rafaeli and all the entertaining opinionated weirdos make the class entertaining and worth attending.\nWorkload:\nCompletely manageable. There's an average amount of reading which is mostly interesting. There are three small assignments that are interesting and fun. There are two exams and a final, but he allows a cheat sheet for each exam. He's also a reasonable (even generous) grader. \n"

I skipped class more than half the time, but I studied hard from the book and got an A. So if you find his lectures boring, then frankly, don't go. Read the book, take notes, maybe read the powerpoint slides (which I found not really necessary, but I guess they tell you what to focus on for the exams), and you'll do great because the material of the course is definitely engaging. Also, I disagree with the other review that says he asks for minute details on the exam - yes, you have to be able to tell the difference between different personality disorders and whatnot, but there are no tricky questions or anything difficult - he's nice enough to not even ask about medications.\nWorkload:\nVery very manageable! Three exams (lowest one dropped) and a final, each worth 1/3 of the grade. For each exam, there was A LOT of extra credit - 8%, 10%, and 15% on the final. The extra credit is outside assignments that are very easy and only take an hour of your time at the most. \n"

Rafaeli is able to hold discussions in a 70-person lecture hall, and draws on a great combination of his research and clinical background when lecturing and answering questions. The information itself is really interesting. Definitely a must-take for anyone remotely interested in psychology- dont let the early time deter you. \nWorkload:\n3 midterms (he drops the lowest grade) and a cumulative final. lots of extra credit assignments that get counted as points on the upcoming exam.  \nKnow all the info on the slides thoroughly, and you will do fine.
