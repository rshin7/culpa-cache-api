But getting up on Friday mornings can be a pain and hence many people don't show up and attendance is often taken. The grading depends a lot on the TAs. I got 100% on all assignment and thought this class is chill, but I also know other people who did poorly. I think the trick is to make the paper looks nice i.e. use a lot of graphs and make it pretty like a pitchbook in banking. For me, it is an easy A. \nThe material isn't hard and it is interesting.\nWorkload:\nIndividual paper, discussion, attendance, group paper. \n"
