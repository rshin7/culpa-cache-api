Don't miss out on this section. She's from the west and is down to earth and incredibly nice. I knew nothing about art walking into that class and I left wanting to be an art history major. She's young and passionate. Also, she use to work at the Met and gave us a great guided tour. Every class was funny and our class conversations were always insightful and valuable. This was good CU student bullshitting at its finest, and for once in my life I loved every minute of it. Stay in this section. Fight for this section. I loved it! \nWorkload:\nweekly one-page readings/ five-minute videos, not even important but sometimes interesting. 4 four-page papers on whatever you want. Extremely fair grader and always available to talk. \n"
