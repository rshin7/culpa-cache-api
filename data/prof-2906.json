I was more motivated, stimulated, and received more helpful, more critical feedback in an 8th grade writing class.\nThe Instructor wastes most of the class telling you what authors/writers he likes, and then giving ridiculous and juvinile assignments such as \"write a poem using the letters of your first name as an Acrostic.\"\nThere was virtually no  \"workshopping\" done in this joke of a writing class.  Therefore the only comments we recieved were those of the instructor -- which were not only not helpful, but often just reflected his personal taste, commenting little, if at all, on how you can improve your writing.\nIt astounds me that this person is allowed to instruct.  DO NOT TAKE INSTRUCTOR'S SECTION if you want to immprove your writing.\nWorkload:\nWeekly writing assignments, 30 pages portfolio to hand in at the end -- which is nothing assuming that you've done the assignments.  OVerall, not bad.\n"
