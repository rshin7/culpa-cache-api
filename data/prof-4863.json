Class seemed to be more of an overview of the material and it was up to you to read the textbook and memorize vocab/grammar, etc. \nWe got worksheets/notes for whatever topic we were studying, they were pretty useful for practice, but there was never an answer key to compare against. \nExams are straightforward. You either know it or you don't. Grading was lenient, which I think the whole class appreciated. \nPaul is really friendly and is open to questions through e-mail, office hours, or appts. I'd take another class with him if the opportunity arose. \n\nWorkload:\n5 exams\n4 compositions \n3 discussion posts on courseworks to get us on track for vocab\n1 final presentation \n\n"
