            "review_content": "\nStandard uber-mediocre cellular neurobio course - Nothing exceptional at all about any of the lecturers (Zafir is, how should I put it, \"colorful\", Jessica is annoying and misleading about what will actually be on her test, and Firestein is funny and engaging, but has to cover way too much material in too little time, and is solid at doing so)  Jessica ran the course, and and in her midterm (the second one) she asked for very minute details as opposed to testing concepts - Memorize all your shit, and don't think hard, they will not test you deeply on concepts.\nTake the first two tests - The third is on a shitload of material.\nClass is curved to a B, so beware. If you're a neurscience major, you have no choice - Otherwise, steer clear.\nWorkload:\nMust read a scientific paper every week that are on exams, three midterms, two of which will count, and a final that was on three scientific papers.\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nWorst class to take.  The teaching was horrible and the reviews for exams were useless.  Granted everyone was raving about the class, it was just horrible.  there is no curve and they expect you to know so much and spit back all the information in such little time.  the three professor for one lecture thing sucks. each professor had a different style of teaching, so as soon as you get used to one you have the next one coming in.  Waste of time.  I was be cautious when taking the class because it will kill you GPA. \nWorkload:\nridiculous!  Too much reading and memorization and not enough explanation of materials\n"

            "review_content": "\nSo here's the break down as I see it. Zafir pretty funny and decent lecturer a little haphazard.  Jessica a soulless robot of a woman who kept awkwardly chatting up this one kid in the front of the class during lecture. Stuart was either non existent or hilarious and useless when he did lecture. Overall I was very disappointed in what could have been a very interesting course. I'm an engineer and so the first part of the course which is a little mathier than most bio/neuroscience/pre-med kids like was pretty easy, but the what should've been the most interesting parts of the course (the latter 2/3) were taught so poorly it was hard to enjoy it. \nSo, basically the most mediocrely mediocre course for a very interesting field of study. \nWorkload:\nNot that bad really for the midterms. The final was choose 2 sets from a 3 paper set, a 1 paper set, and another 3 paper set. The key is to know all the basic details of the experimental methods (what the model system was, why they used it, what methods did they use, etc.) And being able to tie those methods in with the results and basically recreate a fairly detailed outline of what was done in the experiment.\n"
