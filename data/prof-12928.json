            "review_content": "\nOne of the best classes I've taken at Columbia and certainly one of the best Economics courses. \nIf you are interested in graduate school or advanced studies in economics, take this course. It requires some pure math, but at a very reasonable level- there are very few really challenging proofs in HW, nothing like you might have seen in Modern Analysis. The tests are manageable to easy (see below), the problem sets long but not too hard, and you can do them in pairs. The material itself is hard, but\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nSusan Elmes' legendary teaching abilities are even more manifest in this course than in her better known intermediate micro course. She elucidates concepts and performs proofs in such a clear way that you will hardly ever be confused even by very complex material. She's also much more light hearted in the class, so it's a real treat to listen to lectures- I was often on just a couple of hours of sleep in class but never felt even the slightest bit tired or bored. \nNote: I found recitations pretty useless, since you learn the math through lectures and especially PSets, but it might be different in a different year. \nThe material is extremely interesting, because it is an economics course from a pure math point of view- everything is proven, axioms are created and challenged, and the last chapter has mathematical axioms leading to conclusions about social welfare, like Arrow's impossibility theorem and axioms behind Utilitarianism and Rawlesian theory, which to me was really mind-blowing. However, you don't learn that much that is new per se, it's mostly the same material as intermediate micro, just with a completely different methodology (much like advanced metrics). So if you're looking for fascinating new ideas and new directions in economics you hadn't explored before, and aren't really interested in advanced methodologies and thinking- this might not be for you (especially if you're allergic to proofs and higher math). \nBut otherwise- you owe it to yourself to check this out. It's a sight to see, and legitimately fun and awesome. \nWorkload:\n30%- Weekly HW and in-class problems (which are more or less weekly for the first half of the course, then almost entirely missing the second half). Expect the former to take a good 10 hours or so, and make sure to find a partner to work with. There are typically 5-6 easy or very manageable problems (hints at the back of the book are invaluable!) and 2-3 annoying or hard ones. They can be pretty cool at times, though. The in-class problems are problems which students solve on the board at the beginning of class. Usually pretty straightforward, expect to do one of these in the semester, but keep track of the solutions- they often come up on tests. \nAlso, major plus- homeworks are due on friday (9 days after being assigned)! \n30%- Midterm. In classic Elmes style, the test is very manageable (mostly computations and very short proofs you've seen before), no surprises, she tells you exactly what it'll be like\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but if you don't know what you're doing, you'll lose time where you don't need to, and that'll mess you up. So just listen carefully to what she says will be on the test and know those things solidly, and you should do great. Breadth (knowing all subjects moderately well) is more important here than depth (knowing a few subjects perfectly). \n40%- Final. Basically the same as the midterm, maybe a little easier. Non-cumulative (thank goodness). \n"
