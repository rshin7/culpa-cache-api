            "review_content": "\nProf. Wiedenmayer was my favorite psychology professor at Columbia. His lectures were always clear, concise, and informative. He had the ability to relate even the most complicated topics to novice learners. Prof. Wiedenmayer had a gift for teaching, and he truly cared that his students learned and absorbed his lessons. His passion for the topic was always apparent, as his love for science and natural curiosity always shined through. In addition to his teaching, Prof. Wiedenmayer was a great mentor to his students. I took two classes with him, and I can say that he is largely responsible for opening my eyes to neuroscience. He will be greatly missed by many, but his legacy as a wonderful professor, a supportive mentor, and a kind and caring individual will live on through all of those fortunate enough to have known him. Thank you Prof. Wiedenmayer for all that you shared. I am truly grateful to have gotten to know you.\nWorkload:\nAlways interesting.\n"

May he rest in peace.\nI wanted to leave some comments from his friends and family so that he can be remembered not only as a professor at Columbia, but also as just a really great guy, and a real scholar.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"Christoph was always the first to come to our parties and the always the first to leave, too. And he loved punk rock and new wave. Saw some legends like the Damned, Joey Ramone and Joe Strummer with him in NYC. RIP.\"\nRoman\n\"I am still under shock and cannot believe that Christoph has passed away so quick. We were close friends since the beginning of the eighties and did a long way together. He was with me in the ups and down of life. I am so sad.

We lost a brother and friend and godfather and son and we are hurting so much. I am happy and proud of him hearing that he was able to contribute and convey his passionate interest in science and neurobiology. He had so many incredible talents. As a zoologist he knew all about animals and drew fantastic sketches. As an avid reader he knew the literature from classics to post-modern. He was into arts and films and music and history and nature. Modest and playful with children. Caring and reliable. We miss him so much and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to go on and fill this void.\nI hope the little seeds he planted will grow and flower.\nMungu anajua yote.\"\nHis sister Karin\n\"Christoph was one of the best human beings I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever met, and set standards for the rest of my life. I loved his sharp intelligence and his acceptance of others (even when seeing through them). And his innocence, which kept him curious. We belong to the same generation of Europeans who grew up on glam-rock and french songwriters (and yes, punk and new wave too), and felt that NYC was still the Great Adventure. Still ended up together in Damascus in the worst hotel ever, with Christoph totally cool about it. He will always be with me.\"\nMariana Mila Macchi\n\"I havent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually realized, what happened to my brother.\nI still wonder why?\nNot how, but why.\nWhy just him, such an extraordinary human, so popular, so great, so healthy.\nI haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t found an answer yet, it will last weeks, months, even years \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nI love you, Christoph!\"\nThomas, brother, Switzerland\n\"I can hardly bear looking at the picture of Christoph. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so hard to believe and to accept that we will never meet again! That we will never eat Fondue together in wintertime and have Barbecue in the garden in summertime while discussing about a lot of topics. Christoph has been a wonderful brother-in-law. He was interested in so many things (from cooking to gardening to italian literature), so curious to know other opinions and so open-minded. He always was sincerely interested in the life of other people. And he was a fantastic uncle too! Our son loved playing and kidding together with his uncle. Only a few months ago they played together with the trains that Christoph and his brother Thomas played with in their childhood. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so sad that Christoph will not see growing up his nephew. He could have taught him such a lot, and Dominic would have been so proud of him!\nthank you Christoph for everything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve given to us. We are very, very sad. We miss you su much and we will always love you and never forget you.\"\nInes, your sister-in-law\n\nWorkload:\nna\n"

But, for this course, his lectures were incredibly rudimentary and simple.  The course basically comprises of memorizing his powerpoint lectures. The textbook is not needed at all.  The exam questions at many times do not accurately judge your knowledge and understanding of the material, but rather, judge basic rote memorization of the lectures word-for-word.  BTW, the exams are incredibly simple.  Really, really, really, really simple.  Really.  Just rote memorize the lectures, and you will be fine.  But the thing is, because of this, the median is quite high and the standard deviation is incredibly low.

However, I did suprising well in Mind, Brain, and Behavior with minimal effort. Professor Wiednmayer's teaching style is very straight foward. Just make sure to print out the slides before class, write notes on them while in his lecture, and study straight from that. No need to use the textbook (I didn't even buy it), or study for days. Simply review three hours before the exam, do the extra credit and you get an A.  Now, even though the class didn't require a lot of work, it was still a pretty interesting class. Professor Wiednmayer, with his silly little German accent, keeps everyone entertained and focused on the material, by using examples and anacdotes related to whatever subject we currently are covering. He was a wonderful professor, and I would recommend him to anyone who considers into going into psychology/neuroscience orwho is simply interested in the brain and would like an intro class that doesn't make you want to surgically remove your brain.\nWorkload:\nNo homework, just three exams (the first two are graded as midterms (25% each), the last is the final(50%). On top of that you can participate in six credits worth of experiments (counts as extra credit) and six self tests that add on to your final grade (however, these are graded by TAs and so the grade depends on their personalities). \n"

Because of this, this was probably the easiest class I've ever had to review for at the end of semester.\nThe material is fairly straight forward. This is a survey course, so if sciences are not your thing you will probably be fine. There's a bit of basic biology but no chemistry or physics. That said, if sciences are your thing (especially if you're a psyc major) you may find yourself wishing there was a little more depth. \nIf you are going to be a psyc or neuro sciences major and are thinking of just taking Science of Psyc to fulfill your freshman requirements, you may do well to take this class as well. It will set you up for any neuro classes you take later on as well as give you a good foundational knowledge of neuro anatomy and physiology. \nWorkload:\nThree exams with the final being quasi accumulative, but still heavily focussed on the final third of the class. Throughout the semester there are six very short extra credit assignments, but otherwise there are no essays in this course. The exams were very short.

This was a very bad combination for me. Because the course has to be accessible, the material is removed from its context, and in this sense becomes largely incoherent. The nonscientific students come out thinking that they didn't understand the biology, but I think the lack of context and logical continuity trips them up more. You end up sitting in a lecture hall with 100+ people [who often talk, go online, and leave garbage on the floor] and watch slides flash on the screen. I disagree with reviewers who have called Christoph precise or clear. The lectures seem misty, I think reflecting the problem of the lack of context I just wrote about. One reviewer said that Christoph didn't seem that bright, and I can understand this accusation, but, still, I think it's more of a problem of him trying to communicate after having dropped scientific language for the sake of having a course that easily fulfils a science requirement. I still think it's possible to have a 1000-level Mind, Brain, Behavior type course for students without a science background, but so much vagueness needs to be cleaned up. I would have learned a lot more and made much more effective use of time if I just received a list of assignments to do alone instead of trying to decipher the lectures. Avoid at all costs if lecture halls make you squirm.\nWorkload:\nLight. Two tests and a final (25%, 25%, 50%), and optional weekly self-tests. \n"

The problem is that this class is like a survey course of neuroscience, but because a lot of the topics are interesting students ask really specific questions that only a professor of that specific area being covered would be able to answer.\nHe gives a 3 to 5 minute break in the middle of class which is GREAT.  He understands that you can't keep the full attention of a person for 75 minutes straight.\nYou DON'T need a solid scientific background at all to succeed in the class, grade-wise anyway... Grades are based on three tests (2 midterms, 1 final).  STUDY for these tests... Best way to study review powerpoints.\nHe posts the slides ahead of time.  Print them out before class and take notes directly on them... works well that way.\nJust be sure to put in a few hours of study time for each test.  Or if you can review your notes each week to help commit stuff to memory... but of course spending one night studying for the tests is easier... The first test is a really good indicator of the next two...\nOverall, I was disappointed with the class... the tests really just tested how well you memorized terms (YES.  STUDY. THE TERMS HE LISTS ON THE SYLLABUS PAGE.  It really points you in the right direction) rather than testing your understanding of the concepts.\nBut whether or you're an English major or a bio major, you've got equal chances of doing well in the class.  It may be a lot of technical jargon abd scientific crap, but in the end, it's just memorizing info which everyone can do.\nWorkload:\nExtra-credit self-tests (optional, of course)...

The problem with this class is not that it's biologically oriented; clearly, if you don't want to learn about the biology you shouldn't take this class.  The problem is that Wiedenmayer  \\does not understand the biology well enough.  In fact, I got the general impression that he's just not that bright.  Several times, Wiedenmayer described the procedure and results of some experiment, then would claim a conclusion that didn't really seem to follow.  When he was questioned because of this, he would typically answer politely, but not really engage with the point made by the questioner.  Sometimes he would defer, erroneously claiming that everything would be clarified later, sometimes he would just repeat something he had already said, even though it wasn't really relevant.   (Note to previous reviewer: Yes there were some dumb questions.  But there were also a lot of intelligent questions that he treated as if they were dumb.)  Additionally, he seemed to inappropriately simplify (e.g. his explanation of evolution) or simply get wrong (e.g. his description of the work of Stephen Pinker)  some basic facts and concepts.  There were some other shortcomings to this class.  The exams focused entirely on vocabulary, not abstraction.  That is, they measured only how well you had memorized the lectures, not how well you understood the concepts.  I realize that in a class like this a significant amount of memorization is appropriate, however, I think it should be better balanced.  For instance, the essay questions could ask you to explain an experimental result or  consider a theory, rather than simply  asking you to repeat facts learned in class.\nAlso, the class was seemingly filled with freshmen satisfying their science requirement, who seemed to feel that it was totally acceptable for them to talk loudly through class, which could be fairly distracting.\nDespite all of this, the class was far from a  waste.  While, I think Wiedenmayer's understanding of the material is somewhat lacking, he is reasonably good at presenting what he does understand.  Also, the textbook is pretty good (although largely unneccessary).  I came away from this class, having learned a significant amount of neuroscience, which I think is a fascinating subject.\nWorkload:\nTwo midterms, final, weekly extra-credit self tests.  I reccomend the self tests; not only will they boost your grade, but having done them will make your studying for the exams easier.  The exams are fairly straightforward, however to do well you need to study the notes closely, which is pretty boring.  I took this course as an elective, and in retrospect, I wished I had pass-failed it.  Even though I ended up with an A- ultimately, it required a lot of tiresome work that didn't really contribute to my basic understanding of the subject.\n"

The connection to the real world is definitely a nice plus.\nHe's also great at answering questions, no matter how dumb they are.

He would reply to email qustions with lengthy, clear explanations that were very helpful.\nWorkload:\n2 midterms, Final, Extra credit self tests. The tests were fairly straightforward, although there was the occasional question that focused on something we had only vaguely touched on in class. Do the self tests: my grade went from an A- to an A+ because of them. Do the reading after the class, that way you can focus on the just the pertinent sections.\n"

Wiedenmayer focuses almost all of his attention on the biological aspects of the brain and almost entirely ignores the psychological aspects of it.  The only people who have a shot at doing well in this class are premeds and GS students.  I worked harder in this class than any other and barely made out with a C+ (after the self tests).  If you want to keep your sanity and GPA in good shape, avoid this class.  However, if you are determined to take the class, be sure to do all the self tests.  They really help you out in the end.\nWorkload:\n2 midterms and a final, all of which expect you to know every detail mentioned in the lecture.  There are also self tests each week.  Each question you get right on these adds a point to your final grade.\n"

The grades are based on a curve, so the premeds make it almost impossible to get anything above a C. Also, none of the test scores indicate your final grade. You won't realize until it's already stuck on your transcript that although you've been making B+'s on the midterms and the final, you actually get a C for the class. He also likes to copy and paste emails, so if you write him more than once about something, chances are you'll get the same reply. Be good to your GPA and stay out!\nWorkload:\nnormal midterms and final, self tests for extra credit (if you're taking the risk of this class, do the self tests)\n"

He is absolutely dependent on them: One time, when the light bulb on the projector burned out, he could barely function! The class is interesting, but too much on the biological side. There's a huge emphasis on terminology and brain structures/processes. On the other hand, I enjoyed the class because I found the topics to be interesting. Plus, the midterms are pretty easy, if you go to classes. This is NOT a class to be missed. Reading the textbook is just about unnnecessary unless you want a more technical, in-depth explanation (which is, unnecessary).\nWorkload:\n2 midterms, 1 final (cumulative), self-tests every week. Take the self tests! For every question you get right, it's another extra point added to your final grade.\n"

For a biology or a pre-med major his attempts at these explanations, particularly genetics, seem poorly put together and even borderline incorrect. For a non-science person the explanations are overwhelming and boring. Any time a student offers a bit of advice, a question, or a suggestion, he smirks very condescendingly and fakely and ignores what the student has to say. \nWorkload:\nWeekly extra- credit. A lot of reading that doesn't need to be bothered with. \n"

Take the real Intro to Psych 1001. This class is so much biology (and thus rote memorization) and you have compete with so many crazy pre-med students with photographic memory and infinite diligence that mere curiosity is not enough). In short, to succeed in this class, you need to be pre-med. Prof Wiedenmayer is pretty cute and teaches okay. Lectures can be a little boring at times, but I guess that depends on whether you're pre-med or not. The TAs are pretty but not too helpful. A word about lifelong learners: don't underestimate them. There was this 40ish bald man with a beard in my class and I kept thinking to myself, 'Ha, this guy is gonna help my grade by being at the bottom the curve.' Later I realized he's actually practicing physician. One really has to wonder why someone with an MD would go back to school to do intro to neuroscience. To conclude, I think it'd be nice to have two different classes: Mind, Brain & Behavior and Mind, Brain & Behavior for pre- and current meds.\nWorkload:\nDepends on whether you're pre-med and whether you mind getting a C+. But, on average, not too bad.\n"

Prof. Wiedenmayer does a great job of setting goals for the course and communicating to students what they need to know for the exams.

He uses Power Point presentations and goes through his slides at an extremely rapid pace making his students scribble to keep up because he rarely cares if you ask him to slow down, and when he does slow down, he seems annoyed or does not have the answer to your questions. The best sessions of this class were when there were guest lecturers! His exams are ambiguous and students are not allowed to keep them for studying pu\nWorkload:\nHeavy reading, which doesn't matter because he only tests on his lectures, 2 exams plus final. Not bad, this class SHOULD have sections though to weed through his lecture\n"
