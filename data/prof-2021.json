The only thing that she didn't have was an extensive knowledge of the subject, which is not a comment on her, but the relegion dept. for assigning her to the class. They must be short on grad students. That aside, she's incredibly approachable, highly intelligent, very even handed, object and interprative in good doses. Big up to Miss Seth!\nWorkload:\nmild\n"
