Those who rejoice when they see the light workload on the syllabus should be forewarned that not only will they learn very little in this class but also that they are susceptible to seeing grades that neither they nor their friends have ever seen before in a social science class. Yes, it is true that one may be able to submit garbage and get an A, but it is also true that one can hand in a masterpiece and receive a C. Also, the class completely lacks structure and usually serves solely as a pulpit for Thompson's ultra-liberal diatribes. If you want to either learn some political science or get a grade that corresponds to the quality of your work then avoid this professor's class like the plague.\nWorkload:\nVery Light: 2 take-home exams \n"

But if you hold conservative political views, be warned: this man is so liberal, he's off the spectrum. He told my class that he thinks black people are just as oppressed now as they were during the days of slavery, and that if blacks and Latinos do poorly, it is NOT their fault, but entirely due to the fact that society discriminates against them. Everything is take-home, so it's easy to get an okay or good grade. But again, be sure to express LIBERAL views only in your writings if you're going for top grades.\n"
