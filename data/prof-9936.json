The material was boring, the professor was bad, and the TA barely spoke English.\nIt was at 8:40 in the morning, which made it extremely hard to focus, since it was pretty dry material that Anthony's infrequent jokes didn't help much.\nIt's clear that Anthony knows a ton about statistics, but he in no way knows how to break it down for low-level classes. He was constantly stumbling over his words, messing up simple concepts, and writing things wrong on the board, which made it extremely difficult for someone with no stats experience to get what was actually going on. He also mainly used PowerPoint slides to teach, which meant that he sped through the lesson way too fast, since he didn't have go even write down one step at a time of any example problem he wanted to show. The one day the projector broke and he had to slow himself down and write problems out on the board was the one day I actually understood something in lecture.\nAnthony also had real trouble engaging and controlling the class. His efforts to be a nice guy made it impossible for him to rein in the people starting to leave 5 minutes before the end of lecture (he usually got desperate and, not knowing what to do, just looked around wildly and declared that he guessed class could be done now), and also made it impossible for him to get anyone in the lecture hall to answer any question he would pose (leaving him awkwardly standing at the front as we were silent).\nI ended up just having to re-teach all of the lecture material to myself outside of class, which was really time-consuming and didn't work very well. At the end of the day, I Pass/Failed the class because I wasn't able to teach myself enough of the material to be able to do well.\nFor anyone who isn't required to take this class for their major, I would give it a hard \"don't take.\"\nWorkload:\nWeekly homework assignments (took about 4 hours each)\nMidterm\nFinal\nFinal project (in 2 parts)\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class was incredibly frustrating. The first four weeks covered material that I could have learned about by watching a semi-intellectual sitcom, whereas the rest of the semester moved at high speed. He very quickly covers or even completely skips over the very complicated formulas that deserved two weeks to discuss. The lectures were mumbled and filled with ranting, and whenever he worked out a problem on the chalkboard, he wrote small and scribbled, without properly explaining anything about it. I ended up teaching myself all of the materials, as he was never available and the TA's were completely unhelpful. You actually saw students in the class pulling out wikipedia in class to teach themselves the material while tuning the professor out. He once re-scheduled a make-up test without telling me that he changed the date, causing me to wait in the STAT office for an hour for no reason. He briefly apologized. The textbook is well done, easy to understand if you are willing to spend several hours a week teaching yourself.\nThe project took hours of data collection and analysis. He poorly explained the first part, so it was entirely possible to get to the second section of the project without having the information needed to fill it out. The grading was clearly done by a brief skimming of the material, and they docked me 10 points that I later got back for failing to notice information that I put in bold all-caps at the beginning of the second page- making it painfully obvious they picked a grade without looking at the assignment. \nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets (anywhere between an hour to four hours). Midterm and Final. Project took perhaps 30 hours total to complete.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Donoghue is kind and approachable. He encourages participation and student questions. He brings the material to life with really interesting examples and, occasionally, videos. His lecture delivery could use some work, as he can be a bit difficult to follow, but all in all, he means well. \nI had two main problems with this course as it was offered in Fall 2014:\n1. The size - There were 160 students in the class, and it was by far the largest section of Stat 1111. (The other sections had about 60-80 students). Prof. Donoghue said on the first day that he tried to learn every student's name, and he seems like a professor who would really shine in a smaller class. I think that this semester, Prof. Donoghue's effectiveness as an instructor was hampered by the class size. For one, our class was so big that we were placed in a room that is not typically used as a classroom. The makeshift projector screen was small and difficult to see from many parts of the room. \nAs the semester progressed, attendance dwindled down to embarrassingly low levels. I would say that less than a third of the class attended regularly. Some students imagined that, as a result of the sheer size of the class, they were basically anonymous to the professor. People would regularly walk in late, walk in to turn in their homework and then just leave - this is not only distracting, but incredibly rude.\n2. Homeworks - HWs are graded based on both completion and correctness. Students who gave the homework their best shot might still have gotten a low score if their answers were incorrect. Homework was originally 25% of the grade, but then the professor learned that some people were cheating. As a result, he made homework just 15% of the grade, and made the midterm and final each worth 5% more. \nMy advice to the professor: Rather than assigning textbook questions, write your own homeworks. Heck, have one of your TAs do it. As long as the answers are out there, and some students have access to them while others don't, it is unfair to grade homeworks according to how correct they are.\nWorkload:\nHomework - 15% \nProject - 15% \nMidterm - 25% \nFinal - 45%\nAs other reviewers have said, this class is more time-consuming than it appears.\n"

If you want it, you will get a good grade and like any other class at Columbia you will have to work for it. Do not be fooled by the idea that this class is going to be easy because there is no math. This class is manageable because much of the content is common sense and what math there is, is fairly basic. It really does teach you a new way, or a new approach to thinking in terms of statistics. If you're going to be open to that and, perhaps a little uncomfortable until you get the gist of it, then I'd say you'll be fine. If not, stick to what you know and forget the liberal arts degree thing. The homework's are not hard, they are tedious. But do them, they are a significant portion of your grade, they are relatively straight-forward and they are great study guides for the midterm. \nDonoghue will know your name by the first few weeks, and it is nice considering how many of us are in the class. Most professors wouldn't care to know. He is a sweet man but not a very good lecturer. The lectures are posted online and he reads straight from the slides minus a couple Irish jokes to lighten the mood now and then.  \nVerdict: It's time consuming but manageable. If you know that you already have a course that's going to be difficult for you and you know you're going to need to spend as much time on it as you can then do not take this course. \nWorkload:\n10 HW assignments, lowest grade is dropped, but must do 8 to receive any credit at all.\nMidterm\nFinal\n2 Projects worth 15% of total grade\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis course is very useful and enlightening. \nBefore taking this course, I was blank to the statistical field and afraid that I couldn't follow up. It turned out that I was just over-concerned. The content of the class gave me a well-rounded picture of statistics with clear emphasize and allocation of contents. The class is just accordance with the intro level, yet giving you a bigger picture and more in depth related knowledge during the class for your future study, if interested. Since this course requires fewer maths, it was not demanding and hard in the calculation. All required equations would be provided and the aim of this class is not testing your calculation skills, but the critical thinking and reasoning. The atmosphere of class was very live and open. The case study and the sample questions were quite helpful in understanding the concepts and statistical way of explaining some matters. The professor wanted us to understand what he taught, thus he didn't rush up to meet the deadline, but very patient with everyone, yet we did finish all the stuff in time.\nBtw, the professor is super nice and approachable!!! He's the one you cannot afford to miss! I was totally surprised that he remembered my name just in the second day of class. He cares about students and flexible with the due dates of projects, the attendance and the class organization as long as it is right and better for our learning and understanding. Professor Donoghue is willing and happy to discuss with students and respect students' diverse ideas. Almost everyone of us felt sad at the end of the semester to say goodbye.\nI benefited a lot from this course that my critical thinking was fostered, my professional statistical knowledge was initiated and I got great fun and pleasure.\nI strongly recommend taking this class if you are still skeptical about the data presented to us and would like to know the critical methods to do research and projects.\n\nWorkload:\nThe workload is absolutely manageable and reasonable.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m here to set the record straight about this class.\nThere are a few things upfront that you need to understand:\n1. It is the intro level statistics class. However, math classes require more time than an average humanities class. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like doing problem sets? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the class. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take any math class. This is by far the least work I had to do out of calc I and III, ode, and linear algebra\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6side note: no I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a math genius, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even a math major/minor, I just like learning new concepts and attempting to get my full $50,000 dollars worth out of this damn school each year. \n2. This is Columbia. It is completely fair to give a decent. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like working hard? Maybe you should have gone to a state school and majored in basket weaving. \n3. The class focuses on big topics. Are you interested in understanding what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re reading in NEJM, JAMA, etc? If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know those acronyms, you probably don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a fuck about the content of the class and there is an 80% chance that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the right class for you. You will become one of the people who endlessly complains that the workload is too much and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the point in the class. Get over it; take the higher level if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re so smart. \nThe workload:\n-Completely manageable, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listen to the haters below\n-Some of the questions on the problem sets can feel a bit tedious. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice knowing that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting the right answer. Would you rather waste 2 hours trying to solve a linear algebra problem only to get it wrong and an F on your problem set or 2 hours doing a stats problem set that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re fairly confident you got over a 95% on? \n-Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a lazy lion. People complain about the projects but we have weeks to complete them. WEEKS!!! Skip one frat party and ensuing Sunday hangover and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to finish the project in a few hours\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easier than writing a paper for a class.\nThe professor:\n-He is one of the friendliest professors I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever met. You can email him or the TA with any questions that you have on the problem set. For all you gunners, this allows you to ensure that you get a 100% on every problem set.\n-He cares about his students. Are you a premed? Are you freaking out because you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough letter writers who know your name? Take this class. If you go to class and contribute occasionally not only will you essentially not have to study for the midterm or final, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll likely receive a wonderful LOR at the end of the semester\n-He has the student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best interests at heart. The reason why so many people felt overwhelmed at the end of the semester with the project and last problem set was because Prof. Donoghue was nice enough to extend the due date THREE times (per the students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pitiful whining requests at the start of every class). Name any other professor at Columbia who would do that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nOverall:\n-Questionable attendance policies? No. This is college. Do what you want. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re free! Just know that Prof. Donoghue knows every student by name and if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the cusp of a B+/A- at the end of the semester, going to class may just serve its purpose. \n-If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a freshman, welcome to college, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no longer the valedictorian and sometimes you have to do work. Get over it. Now you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re competing with 8349384 other valedictorians for the A in the class. Again, get over it.\n-If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a senior, beware, senioritis, especially if you already have a banking job lined up may overwhelm your ability to do any work. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take this class if you feel like carefree chilling on low lawns everyday\n-Sophomores and juniors, welcome home. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great class to add to your schedule. Just set a time each week when you sit down and do the problem set and it becomes part of a natural routine. I actually did mine on Thursday afternoons/evenings before going out, and then I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have to think about it during the weekend. \n\nWorkload:\n10 problem sets (best 9 counted), 3 projects, midterm, final.\nhomework-27%, projects-15%, midterm-16%, final-42%\n"

But really....that thing about the problem sets being quick and easy was complete bullshit. Well, they are easy, but they're also time-consuming as fuck and incredibly tedious. Professor Donoghue is great and all, but for some reason he thought it would be acceptable to assign us a project (longer version of a problem set) AND the most incredibly time-consuming problem set that were due on Monday and Wednesday of the same week. Think ten pages of writing and at least eight different graphs for just one of them.....WHO DOES THAT????\nI'm hoping he sees this by the end of the semester and never tries doing that to us again.

His lectures integrate practice problems with practical applications, like news clips and psych studies. He constantly had us laughing and really cultivated a sense of community in a class of 60+ because he took the time to learn everyone's name.  During lectures, he was always asking the class what topics we wanted more explanations on, even giving individual students the chance to take the spotlight and explain concepts in new terms. He made himself endlessly available in person and by email, too; he was always fielding questions and sending out explanations and clarifications on the material and on assignments to the class. I'd forgotten how nice it was to have a teacher who was passionate about teaching and connecting with his students before this class.\nAlso, lecture attendance every day is optional, so if you want to do the fairly straightforward homework, fairly projects, and studying for exams on your own, it's ok by him. And if you aren't into that sort of thing or happen to struggle with stats, in my opinion, the combination of the clarity of the textbook, his availability, and the pace of the curriculum make Intro to Stat Reasoning one of Columbia's most manageable courses. Some below didn't love his lecturing style and I could see that, but the class is designed so well that I never found it to be a problem.\nWorkload:\n10 HWs, drop one.

Dealing with uncertainty in both mathematical and real world terms is a necessary human activity.  Donoghue deals with the ideas about how we can and should do this in elegantly simple ways.  The class is not complicated but if you get it, it is profound.  I would draw an analogy to evolution.  The idea is incredibly simple, understanding the implications and ramifications is less so, but neither of these facts gives us access to how important and fundamental the idea is.  \nTake this class, if you show up and are thoughtful you will get a tremendous amount out of it.  The professor is extremely nice as well.  He learned everyone's name by like the second class in a room with like 60 people and optional attendance.  Only a professor that actually cared would bother doing this, and the odd thing was that he acted like it was totally normal, and just was calling on people by their names until people were like, do you know all of our names, and he went around the room and said hello to us addressing us by our first and last name correctly.  \nAlso his accent is great and makes listening to him a treat.  Finally he makes statistics very relevant and is constantly making insightful analogies to seemingly unrelated topics like Bob Dylan lyrics or 1984 or Huxley.  It makes the math part of statistics seem a lot more interesting and relevant.  \nTake this class, you will not regret it, and if you show up and are decently intelligent, do very very well to boot.  I never write reviews but I felt like the other one was so unjust I had to write this.  \nWorkload:\nvery reasonable, you can do very well if you pay attention and do your (very straightforward) assignments.

            "review_content": "\nThis is a shockingly good class if you can understand what it is fundamentally about.  Clearly the other reviewer could not, and I am pleased to see most disagreed with her.  Below are a few of the reasons to take the class.\nThe professor is extremely nice (he learned everybody's name by like the second day in a 60 person class with optional attendance).  He did not do this b/c he is a freak with names, he did it because he cared about connecting with his students.  Having a professor like this is always a good thing.  \nSecond -- the class is not unnecessarily complicated.  It is true that the fundamental ideas put forth in it are not terribly difficult to understand, but internalizing them and seeing their ramifications are what is really important and this is what the class is about.  I would draw an analogy to evolution.  The idea of evolution by natural selection is extraordinarily simple and can be boiled down to a few sentences, and having a whole course explaining it would in some way seem unnecessary.  This does not mean, however, that the implications of the idea are simple or that internalizing the worldview that it gives us is not important.  Just as you can have a course on evolution (a fundamentally simple idea) so too can you have this class, for it gives you access to a way of dealing with uncertainty and probability (things we must deal with as humans living in the world) in both mathematical and real world terms.  I would add that the latter is often forgotten in statistics classes, though it is ultimately probably more important, but Donoghue treats it very thoroughly and thoughtfully.  \nThird -- his accent, you simply can not beat it.\nFourth -- If you pay attention to what is going on it is not difficult whatsoever.  In fact, I don't really think he wants it to be, he just wants you to show him you get the ideas, and as I suggested those ideas at a fundamental level are pretty basic. \nFifth -- the assignments are straightforward, there is no guesswork, though you do have to be thorough to do well.  \nSixth -- He puts statistics (which he admits, in and of itself is not thrilling material) in a broader perspective (he makes insightful analogies to 1984, Huxley,  Bob Dylan to name a few) thereby making it way more interesting than it would be if taught by someone else.  \nI could go on but there is not much need, if you are not convinced by now you probably won't be.\nIf you are sensible (and it is unfortunately quite clear that many people in the class were not) there is a lot to be gotten from this class, I would highly recommend it.    I never write reviews but when I saw that the other one was all there was for this great professor I was inspired to write this one.  \nWorkload:\nVery reasonable\n"

If you decide to take it because (like me) you need to fulfill that stat requirement you've been putting off, or it's the only class that fits into your schedule, be prepared for:\n> half the semester to be wasted explaining concepts such as \"mean,\" \"median,\" and \"mode\" which you probably learned in elementary school, and definitely needed to get a high enough score on the SAT to get into Columbia (on a side note, people in my class who didn't know these things: HOW DID YOU GET IN? and how can I sign my kids up for it in the future. Give a girl a hand here.)\n> the second half of the semester to be devoted to everything else in statistics that you may NOT have known, crammed all together \n> a book which refuses to give you formulas and equations, instead offering ambiguous prose definitions which don't actually help you when faced with solving a problem.\n> more writing (hw, projects) than I've done in 70% of the lit seminars I've taken\n> a teacher who acts as if this class is the only one you're taking and dUH the most important one. \nthis being said, the homework is relatively easy, the midterm was easy (although, maybe I'm an idealist, but I thought a math class wouldn't require filling two blue books with straight writing) \nWorkload:\nhw- weekly, relatively easy, LOTS OF WRITING\n3 projects- WTF get off my tip. This is an intro class CTFD with the workload no one wants to be here. LOTS OF WRITING.\nmidterm- easy concepts, with cheat sheet\nfinal\n"
