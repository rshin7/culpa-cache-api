He also made sure class was always dynamic and fun, something I've heard is uncommon in UWriting sections. We would often delve into extremely interesting discussions of the seed texts, which would often raise interesting philosophical questions, instead of merely discussing essay structure and mechanics. While I don't necessarily agree with the way the course is structured, I think John managed to do the best he could with the syllabus, and definitely helped me improve as a writer.\nHe's also an extremely fair grader.\nWorkload:\nStandard UWriting workload.\n"
