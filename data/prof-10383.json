He seemed initially a bit unsteady, but gained confidence and mometum as the course progressed.  He has a funny sense of humor too. The homework was kind of annoying as everything was done online, but all in all, it wasnt too terrible; Zach was really good about grading and being fair.  The midterms and the finals were fair as well. If you put in the work and pay attention, you'll do great!\nWorkload:\non-line hw, 2 midterms, one final\n"
