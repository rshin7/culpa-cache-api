He is a wealth of knowledge spanning a wide variety of topics - it was such a joy to listen to him. He's incredibly passionate. I feel lucky to have been randomly placed into his class. I highly recommend you seek out this class if you want to come out of it having learned something. \nWorkload:\n3 hours a week: 1-3 readings and a short response a week, but due on the first day of the class so there's no work for the second. \n"

The readings are not 80 pages as stated below, usually 2 are given a week and if uninterested, you can really only read one (about 20-30 pages each.) Seriously engaging class with someone who is highly informed and passionate about his subject - pretty much any question you have will be answered with incredible insight. The classes are super interesting and, quite often, funny, and the essays are short, few and far between. \nDefinitely my favorite class of the semester (and I am a science major!)\n\nWorkload:\nReadings and responses (250 words) a week, 1 midterm, 3 essays including the final take home paper. \n"

Change if you get him, unless you want 80+ pages of reading a night, intricately critiqued essays, and a whole lot of weird speech emphasis on the \"ct\" sounds in words and the word \"right?\" after every single sentence. \nWorkload:\n80+ pages of reading a class, paragraph responses due each week, essays, calls you out in class regularly. \n"
