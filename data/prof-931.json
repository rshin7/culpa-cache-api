Theres a few papers, midterm and final, recitation once a week and you won't know shit for any of them because you haven't paid attention all semester.  Good thing he loves curving.\nI legit made up bullshit historical facts on my final because i had no idea what to write about. Like just straight up lied about history so that I could put down something for the essay.  Had failed the midterm, guaranteed failed the final and did fine on the paper and got like a B- or something just to fill the global core req.  If you want to learn don't take this, if you want to get by and fulfill a req this is your go to.  Don't be afraid midway through when you don't know shit and feel like you're failing, you'll be fine come post finals.\nWorkload:\nmidterm, paper, final, recitation\n"

The students were responsible for running every two hour seminar by discussing the readings and leading a class discussion, which was a big portion of your grade.There was very little or no context for the readings, so the discussions often felt painful with half the class tuning out. Overall, this was a missed opportunity as the subject matter is fascinating and I would have welcomed more work if it would have given me a better understanding. Professor Mann could have done a lot more.\nWorkload:\nWeekly readings (relatively light)\n-Portrait (5-10 min presentation and a 3-5 pg. paper on an approved historical figure) 30%\n-Participation/ Discussion Leading for one class 30%\n-Final Paper (15 pages) 40%\nAttendance was mandatory\n"

Discussion never passed name-dropping. It was a very mediocre experience.\nThe lectures were awkward and slow. I wish I could have engaged with the topic more, as African History is truly fascinating and important to know about; especially in Columbia's narrow West-centric universe.\nI would recommend getting the syllabus and read some of the literature instead.\n\nWorkload:\nessay midterm, essay final, light reading\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class is essentially an upper level survey course and like all survey courses it is inherently muddled and broad. \nProf. Mann only contributes to the confusion with his meandering lectures and inability to effectively touch on (ironically) the \u00c2\u201cmain currents in African history.\u00c2\u201d That\u00c2\u2019s not to say the class is completely uninteresting, at many points I found myself feeling like I was learning things that would be valuable outside the class for many years to come. That being said, the nitpicky grading and all over the place lecture style made those moments more difficult to treasure. This is one of those classes where you think you\u00c2\u2019ve nailed the exams but when you get them back you have a \u00c2\u201cwhat the f*#?!\u00c2\u201d moment as you stare at your blue book. Overall, this class is definitely not terrible but it\u00c2\u2019s certainly not great. If you were looking to find a class to meet the breadth requirements of the history major I would look elsewhere. If you were looking to learn in depth about African history I would look elsewhere. If you absolutely HAVE to take this class for some reason plan on spending way more time on it than you think you have to and you MAY do all right. This class is a GPA buster of the most annoying kind, one where the prof. asks the students to be perfect but falls far from being perfect himself.\nWorkload:\nSeemingly average at first blush but you will find yourself working much harder than you expected for only the outside possibility of a decent grade. The TAs can be brutal and you may end up arguing minutia and semantics a lot. Mid-term and final require in depth knowledge of topics only briefly touched upon (if at all) and further development of themes not adequately addressed in lectures. 10-page papers on the topic of your choice but you have to come up with the idea and sources (both primary and secondary) early on in the class before you really know anything about African history. Weekly discussion sessions are mandatory and TAs are a real pain in the ass about grading. Take another class if you want to learn about Africa or want a decent grade for the amount of work you\u00c2\u2019ll have to put in. My humble opinion: this class is NOT WORTH IT.\n"

There is no outline in his lectures, so he wanders and meanders around important points. The lecture is littered with unnecessary details, making it convoluted and hard to decipher. Additionally, Professor Mann never makes his position clear on major topics, like slavery and colonialism, so views are not challenged. Instead, he weasels around those issues and becomes very politically correct at times. He neither condemns, endorses nor truly presents the white man's burden, just takes a safe alternative to discussing it. The discussions, on the other hand, are very informative and interesting if you are assigned a good TA. \nWorkload:\nMidterm and Final. Research proposal and 10pg. paper. Additionally,attendance at discussion sections is required. \n"

            "review_content": "\nFirst off my grade was a B.  I got a B+ on the first midterm and a C+ on my second midterm.   I will say this. I thought I ROCKED this class but apparently I was wrong.  I had a genuine interest in the class and the content.  I did all the readings save one book, The Joys of Motherhood.  The class is structured through Prof. Mann's lectures in which he outlines some topics at the beginning of class which he may/may not get to but you are expected to learn.  I will admit that I found the lectures most interesting when he had pictures and movies to watch.  Otherwise I was just distracted because he doesn't turn the projector off.   The lectures were ok.  If you haven't done the reading they will definitely help.  But if you have you rarely learn anything new although he will sometimes hint at things that you are definitely expected to learn.  Since I was only interested in the content I was most fulfilled by the readings which are def. worth the time. I don't plan on selling any of them and even plan to reread some.   My TA was Rodney Collins who had been in Mali I think with the Peace Corps.  At first I thought he was a little high and mighty but I think he was actually trying to challenge us to break outside of our stereotypes of Africa.  You could definitely see that some students got it but others I don't think really learned or began to care anymore about Africa.  Quite possibly the most effective experience I've had in any class was when Rodney called me out on a slightly patronizing description of Malian culture.   Other than that uhh the final wasn't too bad although the maps were whack. OH and the midterms and probably the final had NO partical credit.  It was either right (or in most people's case) wrong.  The TA's asked Mann to give us back some points but still it sucked.\nWorkload:\n2 midterms and a final.   There were maps , ids, and essays on the tests.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class covers some interesting topics and Professor Mann is a genuinely interesting lecturer, but many students found it very hard to do well.  The first midterm was based heavily on the lectures and most people did reasonably well on it.  So, for the second midterm, everyone spent most of their time studying their lectures notes, only to discover on test day that the exam was, this time, heavily based on the readings.  The final exam, was based mostly on lecture, again.  Further confusing about the exams is that the first one is counted as 15% of the final grade, the second one 25% and the final as 50%, but each of the three tests covers about the same number of lectures and amount of material, so it's as if to say that modern African history is more important than earlier history - found that confusing and conflicting!  Moreoever, the discussion sections were poorly managed.  They were scheduled to meet every other week, but my TA changed the schedule around so many times, that by about the midterm point no one knew when we were having section and when we weren't - they were held so irregularly that people would show up when he'd canceled it and then wouldn't know to come when he decided to hold it.  Overall this class was a dissapointment for me.  I had been really looking forward to it, because I was genuinely interested in the topics, but the inconsistencies in the exams and discussion sections really ruined it for me.  If you really want to learn about African history, you're probably better off pursuing it on your own as a personal interest!\nWorkload:\nAn excessive amount of reading for a 3 credit class, 2 midterms (one manageable - 15%, one impossible - 25%), and a final (manageable - 50%).  Irregularly scheduled discussion sections (10%) - probably 5 or 6 times a semester.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI wanted to like this class and for a while I did.  However, while his early lectures were organized and easily comprehensible, his latter lectures lacked coherence.  The basic thing he does in lecture is this: he writes some terms on the board and introduces the topic of his lecture for most of the class, declaring what he wants to talk about but never getting to the meat of his lecture and often leaving the terms on the board undefined.  Some of it isn't his fault as the main currents in African history ended up being that there are no generalizations you can make about such a large continent and it would be an epic and impossible task to take on historicizing and linking all of Africa in one semester.  Discussion section was a pain, especially because it was a section for a Major Cutures List A class in which no one does the reading, though the reading was definitely a redeeming factor for the class.  Good class if you are interested in the region or get some breadth, however don't expect enlightenment on the subject that is Africa.  Still, the lectures weren't necessarily empty, which may mean either that people didn't wanna do the reading or that I completely misinterpreted the class.\nWorkload:\nPretty manageable.  Quite a bit of reading coming in the form of a coursepack, textbooks, and literary exposition.  It's all pretty good, though if time is an issue read the literary stuff because they could factor into exams.  2 midterms + 1 final (all cumulative) which consist of IDs from lecture, possible maps, and 2 essays.  Midterms may be harder than the final for the only fact that they must be done in 75 minutes as compared to 3 hours.  Notice I didn't mention anything about a paper.\n"

He rarely straight out lectures, which is good for people who find that teaching style boring and not so great for people who want to hammer down the issues and the facts.  He is not a very easy grader on papers but not unfair either.  He takes the class to see a movie and eat Ethiopian food which is cool.  He is approachable for the most part.  The only thing that is a bummer about the class is the longer paper we have to write.
