You must go to lecture if you want to do well in this course because most of the material from lecture is not covered in the readings and you will have to know it for the exams. The projects were fun and a nice way to get to know another part of the city. As long as you study your notes, the exams are definitely do-able. Overall a good course to take especially to fulfill a requirement. \nWorkload:\n2 papers, a midterm and a final\n"

            "review_content": "\nDO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!\nPaige West is by far the worst professor I have had in my four years at college.  She is incredibly unprofessional to the point where students outright laugh at her during lecture.  I took this class because I was interested in taking an anthropology course, and had read relatively good reviews on CULPA, however  I am incredibly dissapointed in the class.  First, Professor West is constantly changing the syllabus and assignments. Most recently she pushed back the due date on an assignment, so that it fell during midterms-no thank you. In addition, because she is constantly changing the syllabus around (we've received two revised syllabii so far), towards the end of the semester the reading load is incredibly heavy-roughly 300 pages a week--completely absurd for an intro-level class.  Second, she takes forever to grade assignments--we received our first graded assignment the week after the p/f/d deadline.  Third, she teaches with a clear agenda-if you disagree with her extreme Marxist rantings, like myself, you will find her completely one-sided lectures unfulfilling.  Also, be warned-Professor West does not allow you to use a computer in her class-if she sees you with a computer she will make you put it away.  Professor West is incredibly scatter-brained in lecture, and often goes on lengthy tangents on completely unrelated subjects to anthropolgy. Our TA had to correct her numerous times in lecture on key names and dates--an indication of her style of teaching. Also, regarding the many comments posted on her style of dress, I must say that wearing see-through t-shirts and tops that expose your bra are not a style to emmulate in a classroom environment.  If you want to take an introductory Anthropology course look elsewhere!\nWorkload:\nHeavy readings (at least 300 pages a week-some readings better than others--one reading is on sex toys-no joke), 1 in-class midterm (based mainly on lectures-IDS with essay question on readings), 2 papers, 1 participant observation, 1 Final\n"

            "review_content": "\n\"I know you guys will rate me down on CULPA, but...\"\n-beginning of every class/explanation of homework assignment with Paige West (sorry Paige)\nThis class is grossly overrated. Paige West's lectures don't do as much to grab your attention as her clothing (her blinding sequined shirts can even be a distraction). After taking this course, I know little more than I did when I started about anthropology. Professor West went through the history of anthropology for about 3/4 of the semester, then crammed a few current topics in at the tail end. As for the readings, not once did she mention them in class and in discussion the TAs struggled to relate them to the lectures. If you do take this class, don't even bother buying any of the books. It's pointless (and Growing Up Global is quite possibly the worst book ever). It was frustrating to hear Professor West being so hypocritical all the time. Although the lectures often centered around being nonjudgmental and recognizing differences within groups of people, Prof West insisted on making sweeping generalizations about the studentes in the class and Columbia U students in general. She often told us that we were all \"so stressed out\" and over-obsess about grades, or that we all got 1600s on our SATs, which is just... annoying. (And false, from personal experience...)\nBasically, if you want a supereasy class and you can stand Paige West's cutesy attempts to relate to us young people, take this class. If not... don't?\nWorkload:\nShe showed Buffy in class. I think this is a reflection of how difficult this class is. Basically, you don't have to do the readings (esp the books), and you don't really have to go to class (those extra points she hands out aren't actually added to your grade). A few field work assignments. Easy midterm and final.\n"

Prof West is intelligent and funny--yes--but it takes more than that to make a good class.  Her teaching essentially consisted of assigning pretty dense economic texts to a bunch of social science majors and then letting them present on the texts themselves with little interference from her.  Of course, most people didn't understand (or read) the texts, so this led absolutely nowhere, and inevitably half an hour into every class we'd start talking about OUR consumption patterns: i.e. the consumption and struggles of privileged Columbia students, as if that's what matters on a global scale.  We addressed pressing questions like, \"Why do we seek 'authentic' ethnic food?\" and \"Why is it girls can't order whiskey at bars and guys can't order cosmos?\" and \"Is it wrong to buy products because you like the advertising story behind them, even if they cost more?\"  An utter waste of time--and, worse (?), I felt like Prof West kind of knew that.\nWorkload:\nShow up and you get an A.\n"

I made a fuss about being sent out of class for assignments off campus about 3 times, but now I understand and those times were very important to better understanding her concepts. She doesn't BS you at all and is young, sharp, articulate, super down to earth. She refuses e-mail because of the issues involving human contact , but she has office hours and people do see her. This class requires no previous experience with Anthropology, just an open mind. The stuff that we deal with in this class (Count Chocula, Hipsters, WB shows) would surprise most non-anthropology majors. Even if you're not an anthro major, I would reccomend this class anyway. Courses like this and professors like her are why I applied to this college in the first place.\nWorkload:\nNot difficult, but not easy either. About one book or article per week and a coursepack. You do need to use your brain in this class, but it is not busywork, it's worthwhile: 2 Participant observations (they were around 3-4 pages each), 2 papers on public space (for a total of about 6 pages combined), 1 midterm with 3 parts: short answer questions, fill-in-the-blanks and an essay. There is a mandatory discussion section and a final which I havent taken yet. \n"

The beginning texts, although when read again were fantastic, at first read were confusing in combination with her jumbled lectures which never really corresponded with what was being assigned to read.  The other thing, everyone in the lecture hall used laptops for about two thirds of the semester, and finally she banned them.  She kept saying how we didn't need to take all the notes we were taking, and she was right.  Lectures are important to attend, but very little of it will be necessary for the midterm and final.  Using a notebook all semester will force you to cut out all the things you will end up studying for no reason.\nBut the woman is incredible, I couldn't have asked for a more eye opening person to begin my undergraduate career with.  It's clear that all she wants is for the class to learn what she loves, and it's her enthusiasm that pushes everyone over the edge into loving the material themselves.  \nWorkload:\nI have only one semester to compare the amount of reading to, but in the least it was very easy to adjust.  Some practice fieldwork, and an ethnography is the only other thing assigned outside of class, which was rewarding and well worth the time spent, and more importantly doesn't need to be as long as you think, and most importantly she said she wasn't going to assign it again.  Midterm and final are based completely on readings, make sure you can compare authors.\n"

She is also one of the most engaging and charismatic speakers I have ever encountered.  I walked into this class simply wanting to take a class with West.

Actually, I thought that she was the most neutral professor I've had yet.  She was equally critical of the left and the right (when it came up).

Yes, she is openly left-leaning and has very strong convictions that come through in her lectures, but she frequently encourages students to dissent, debate, and disagree with her, to form their own opinions and not just accept hers blindly. The outside reading is not completely relevant as they're not discussed in class, but the T.A.s are really helpful in the discussion sections in terms of forming connections between the readings and broader anthropology. Anyway, I would definitely recommend Professor West, and not just because she plays cool music as people are filing into class, wears great clothing (like a mini-skirt and cowboy boots), and shows \"Bladerunner\" for two classes. \nShe is smart, funny, interesting, and incredibly passionate about what she does. \nDefinitely take her class.\nWorkload:\nHeavy if you do all the work, not so bad if you don't (a big packet of readings, some of which are relevant, some of which aren't).

Though for an intro class, there is a whole load of theory, which sometimes gets confusing but don\u00c2\u2019t worry about it. Professor West and the TA\u00c2\u2019s make the material highly accessible for those who never had background in anthropology. I feel like she\u00c2\u2019s the only professor I\u00c2\u2019ve had that truly understands her students, telling us once or possibly more times that as Columbia students we should have a little fun and not worry so much. She\u00c2\u2019s funny, she\u00c2\u2019s hip and she\u00c2\u2019s just so cool.

Though, there are some students that complain about this class, maybe it is because of the question and answer times, but I say it\u00c2\u2019s all worth it. The class is easy, but you will have to do the readings (most of them anyway) if you want to do really well. I'm really going to miss this class. \nWorkload:\nThe readings are moderate. It's not insane or anything. And towards the end there's a lot of interesting stuff to read. One midterm, one final, field notes, participation observation (fun to do)\nThere are weekly one hour discussion sessions that aren't required, but you should go to anyway because the TA really helps you go through some of the dense readings. Plus, there is, on occasions, some really amazing discussion time. The TA's themselves were incredibly interesting and unqiue in their own ways. All of them were approachable.

She is very open to students' ideas both in class discussion and in formatting projects which is good but hard for a non-anthro major with no background.  It would be better to take this course with anthro experience, something it would be nice if the course book said. However, it is entirely possible to get an A in this course by bullshiting, or at least it felt like bullshit to me.

My goal was to learn something about culture and anthropology - not hear an endless diatribe on the horrors of capitalism (from a woman so concerned with her appearance this seemed somewhat ridiculous & less than honest) and the greatness of Marx.  Overall I would recommend taking this class from someone more interested in teaching the subject than in making sure the \"correct\" moral/political projection is being made.\nWorkload:\nTons of reading which was generally not discussed in class and was written more for anthropologists (use of unnecessarily complex jargon rather than simple discription) than for someone wanting to learn about anthropology. Paper, ethnography project, mid-term & final.  But the READING was a burden!\n"

Lectures can get a little monotonous, but if you're going to take Interpretations of Culture, this is the best professor to do it with.  As long as you take good notes and attend every lecture, you'll be sure to do well on the midterm and final.  Prof. West is very accessible and eager to talk to students after class or in her office (you can catch her running laps at Dodge, too).  She assigns VERY heavy reading assignments, but there's only 1 course reader and it's not necessary to read it all thoroughly - just GO TO CLASS and her lecture will tell you what you need to know for the exam.  (Besides, if you're thinking about majoring in Anthro, you might as well get used to heavy reading!!)  I found her grading to be more than fair, especially since she'll let you rewrite a paper for a higher grade if she thinks you can improve on it, plus extra credit.  Definitely an A+ in my book.  \nWorkload:\nA LOT of reading, but comparable to any other introductory Anthro course... it's a better idea to attend lecture and take notes on her overview of each reading assignment.  Relatively easy papers with relatively lenient grading.  VERY easy midterm and decent final exam(definitions, matching, identifications, choice of short/long essay questions).  Suggestion: get a small study group together to exchange notes/outlines and review a week before each exam.  \n"

While there is an impossible amount of reading, I didn't do one page of it and walked away with a B+. Prof. West covers all the points in class that are going to be on the midterm and final.  Don't waste your time on the reading, just look over your notes and don't be afraid to ask questions in class.  This is a great way to get out of some requirements, but may be better for some less obsessive students.  Just enjoy the lectures and remember that its an intro/ survey class, so she won't go into much depth about any one topic-- if you want more detailed information, take a higher level class.   Interpretation of Cultures is an easy class and she is a more than fair grader.  \nWorkload:\nMountains of ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY reading; easy, concept -based midterm + cumulative final.\n"

She acts like a real person who you can talk to and relate to, though unlike one of the posters I'm pretty sure i don't want to be her...\nJust for clarification, the homework was NOT overwhelming.  Yes there was reading to do, but some were as short as 20 pages, and others, though longer, could be read easily within a couple of hours.  Most of the students were  Barnard students.  Take that in whatever way you wish...\nIf you put even a shred of thought into the homework and into understanding what she was trying to teach, then you can get an A.  She did cover more information than she was going to test on, but she spelled it all out for you.  Yes, even dumbed down the class at times, to make sure everybody understood important concepts.  (Ex. Unilinear social evolution was discussed almost every other class, and EVERYTHING related to it.  If that isn't enough evidence that it will be on the mid-term and on the final then I don't know what is.  If you missed that, you have only yourself to blame.)...\nShe did gloss over some very important topics but only because they did not relate to the class.  Topics like Marxism were dealt with really briefly in connection with other areas discussed, but weren't tested, so what's the problem?...\nIt's an introductory class, so no surprises that it covers a lot of information, most of which seems really boring.  ...\nI think Prof. West is a perfect example of how hard work can overcome any obstacle.  She's not the most brilliant professor I've met, but she obviously knows her stuff and really loves the subject...  \nThe class was huge, so her TA's helped her grade.  No comments on anything, but everybody i talked to (which was by no means representative of the 100 people in the class) got full credit on all assignments.  Yes, one of the TA's did grade much harder than the other, but Paige regraded all work that students thought was unfair.  That seems as good a solution as I can think of considering the circumstances....\nI think you could do much worse than to have her as a professor.\nWorkload:\nQuite a lot of reading, not all of which are necessary.  A few really easy assignments, midterm and final.\n"

She calculates grades without any sympathy or sense of reality.  You will get no break for trying or if you have a bad day on one of the exams.  As in, you can get a C-, even if you show up to class regularly and actually do most of the reading/study.  However, if you are good enough at bullshitting you will most likely get an easy A.  She also tends to assign way too much reading, although you need not actually read any of it since no one else does either.  While she has potential it would probably be best for those who havent fully developed their bullshitting techniques to be wary of her vicious grading until she gets more of a clue of how to grade like a non-robot.\n"

The lectures consisted of non-stop power point presentations and tedious descriptions of anthropological \"history\", all of which West expected the students to record.  The copious readings were often unrelated to the class lectures, and although interesting, they were not discussed in conjuction with anything said in class.  Furthermore, students were expected to provide detailed answers about these readings on the midterm and the final.  Maybe this situation would have been improved with a discussion section, although the TAs were ridiculous in their own right.  As for the grading of assignments, Dr. West vaguely defined an ethnographical, 5-page work, making it seem as though she just wanted you to attempt an analysis of a social interaction.  She proceeded to grade the papers, without any comments, but rather harshly, especially after such a loose definition of what she wanted.  As for the midterms, she had her two TAs do the grading, and one graded much more severely than the other.  So, half of the class suffered as a result.  Dr. West presents herself in a childish manner, even when conversing with a student during office hours.  It is almost difficult to take this woman and her class seriously.  Of all the classes I took this semester, this was by far the worst!  And it is a Barnard class, none the less.  Be prepared for lots and lots of undiscussed reading, and a petty teacher who wears butterfly sequined tops and pink boots, and who asks her students (over 100 in a lecture)to stop hurting her feelings during class.  \nWorkload:\nMidterm, final, 2 ethnography papers, 3 article reviews and LOTS OF READING\n"

However, being neither an anthro major nor one of her seemingly many groupies, I was extraordinarily disappointed with this class. It was her first time teaching it, so perhaps I should not be so harsh, but the reading load assigned was preposterous (at least she realized as much) and her lectures in class were pointless and embarassingly unorganized. Another reviewer mentioned that she was lazy and I completely agree; she may be a little too laid back to be a professor. The topic of the class was really interesting for me and some of our reading extremely thought provoking, but she did little to devote any substantial time to them. This class has so much potential to be great, so I hope she gets her act together by next Fall when she teaches it again. Also, I beg to differ about the points that people have made in regards to her niceness. I've been to see her in office hours and she also seems to overstate a lot in class that she IS nice. Would a genuinely nice person need to be so verbal about it? \nWorkload:\nExtreme amounts of reading in expensive books and readers, but she recognizes this point and plans on cutting down on it. It's hard to tell what to read and what not to read and as previously mentioned by others, her exams are pretty easy although it was hard to study, since her class lectures were so disorganized that it was difficult to see what points she was trying to make. All in all, one midterm, one final, and one short book review (as if we didn't have enough to read already). \n"

Not because she's incredibly brilliant, but because I wanted to be her (men might feel differently, obviously). Despite being an Ivy League professor she wears the coolest vintage clothes, talks about going to Billy Bragg concerts and anti-war protests, calls people she likes \"rockstars,\" admits when she can't teach because she has a hangover, and actually complains that Columbia students work too hard and should have more fun. That being said, as a teacher, she's just alright. She tends to spoonfeed and dumb down (as in, she'll sum up Marx or orientalism in one slide of a powerpoint presentation) really interesting information that could be discussed much further. She also assigns really awesome reading, but never really covers it on the exams let alone in class. And, perhaps out of lazyness, she had a tendency to show movies or to bring in guest lecturers who frankly weren't as interesting as she was and didn't contribute much to the class. All in all, though, this class is a really easy and really awesome introduction to anthropology and you shouldn't miss learning from such an engaging personality. I'm definitely going to try and get into her seminars if only to have the opportunity to really hear what she has to say.\nWorkload:\nLOTS of reading, but it's really not necessary, exams tend to focus on material covered in lectures. mid-term, one page of field notes, 4-5 page \"participant observation,\" 3 article reviews, final. You have total freedom on the field assignments, so they can end up being really fun. She also gives lots of cool extra-credit assignments (going to lectures on Iraq, the Margaret Meade film festival, etc.) that are easy to complete.\n"
