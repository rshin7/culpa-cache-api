You will come out this class knowing basic spanish... but you NEED to go to class because he will tell you exactly what you need to know, plus it's fun.  \nWorkload:\nrandom homeworks from the workbook that are simple if you read.  4 easy quizzes, easy midterm, study words for final and that'll be easy too.  \n"
