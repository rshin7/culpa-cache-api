            "review_content": "\nProfessor Sivard was a wonderful teacher. She's very organized, clear, and good at getting students to participate. She balances being encouraging and receptive with challenging what you're saying, so you feel comfortable talking in class but know you can't do so vacuously without having to defend what you're saying. This brought out interesting and meaningful comments, though of course you always get Those People who are excessively pretentious without really saying anything at all. Prof. Sivard also had a good approach of questioning the Core's selection of artists/pieces/themes (no female artists, the racism implicit in primitivism, etc) in a productive way, which I appreciated.\nShe's an extremely fair grader, too, and lets you revise your essays for a better grade based on her feedback, which was also helpful. She offered an optional tour of MoMA in addition to her required Met tour, which was helpful for me in becoming a more critical viewer of art rather than just someone who absorbs it. Overall, I feel like I really learned a lot and enjoyed this class a great deal. Highly recommended!\nWorkload:\nTypically light (I think) -- several annotations that weren't graded, two short papers, weekly reading that you can skim/skip without missing much, midterm, final.\n"
