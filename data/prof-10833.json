            "review_content": "\nVery sweet, very accessible, very funny. She's a reasonable grader and seems genuinely interested in helping students improve their French. She's very understanding of specific students' needs and does her best to make sure the class is on track with the curriculum. However, class could be very boring at times, and the amount of homework we were assigned seemed excessive. I think she's a very kind and interesting young woman; it may have just been the group of people taking her section that made the class so frustratingly boring. I'm also not sure how standard the homework assignments were across sections.\nNothing too great, nothing too terrible. A very survivable French experience.\nWorkload:\nA few compos, a few tests. Nightly activities online on QUIA, which can be very time-consuming and redundant.\n"
