She is really understanding and willing to acknowledge each student's talents and listen to each and every idea. She passionately loves art! I was a little freaked to take Basic Drawing, seeing as I had never professionally put a pencil to a paper, nor knew the difference between 9B and HB pencils. But it was fine! I learned as I went along. We started with simple contour lines and then built up from there to shading and other tools of the trade. She really helps and knows what she's talking about. She brought in books, took us to Avery and the Met and the Museum of Natural History for inspiration. Also, she's the real deal. She had a gallery featuring her paintings! They're incredible! Google her and then take a course with her. You'll be happy you did.\nWorkload:\nOnce a week drawing assignment. review_contentm review_content of all the assignments in and out of class. And final creative project where the student has almost total control! Just approve your idea and you're golden!\nDon't miss class and do all of the assignments and you should get a good grade.\n"
