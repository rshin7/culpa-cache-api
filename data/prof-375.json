            "review_content": "\nSolid and enjoyable class. The course essentially surveys different areas of database systems (e.g. information retrieval, OLAP systems, data mining etc), beyond the relational paradigm that is covered in 4111. We typically spent 1-2 lectures on each topic. While that meant we weren't necessarily able to go into too much depth, Prof Gravano does a great job explaining everything and I personally felt like I got a lot out of the class. \nProfessor Gravano is really nice, in addition to being a great lecturer. The readings were helpful, but his lectures are really clear and I found them to be most helpful for learning the material. He was very responsive on Piazza too which is always helpful. He seems to care about his students, and did a good job answering questions in class.\nOverall, highly recommended course. \nWorkload:\nNot too bad. We had three programming projects which took a bit of time, but if you start early you won't have any issues. A midterm and final (not cumulative), neither of which were terribly hard. Of course there's a curve so it's all relative\n"

He is also very friendly and helpful during office hours and maintains an active presence on Piazza.\nThe only thing I didn't really enjoy was that he recycled some of the old databases lecture slides, which are sometimes unclear (his own lectures are much more helpful). Definitely show up to class, since the textbook, while helpful, contains more than you need to know and the slides are not very helpful on their own. Also, he offers homework and project grace late days which, while helpful, were not always allowed to be used on certain homework and project parts, which kind of defeats the purpose in some way.\nDespite my nitpicking, Gravano is still a great professor!\nWorkload:\nProblem Sets (15%) - Not too difficult, although be sure not to make silly errors, since most of the class does well on the problem sets.\nMidterm (25%) - The first question requires you to define database terms in at most two sentences - the rest of the exam are free response questions asking you to write relational algebra expressions, write a query, etc.\nFinal (40%) - Like the midterm, but slightly longer.\nProjects (20%, 15% for project 1 and 5% for project 2) - The first one is the longer one and each part is spread out over a couple of months. Definitely start early and pick a good partner, or you will suffer. The second one is much more manageable. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis is an acceptable course, but I have mixed feelings about it. Let's establish some baseline. Dr. Gravano is undoubtedly a capable lecturer, able to explain concepts lucidly. He occasionally told jokes that made the classroom laugh (sometimes). I'm pretty certain he genuinely cares for his students. You will almost certainly learn a lot of new and useful stuff while taking this course. Overall, the course was planned and executed well.\nIf you are on the NLP or ML track \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or you have a strong interest in search engines or big data, you should certainly take this course. This course definitely falls squarely in that domain (I mean hey, the free textbook was on the NLP part of Stanford's website...). I suspect the facts you will learn will be very relevant to you. However, if you are on the software track taking this course just because it has good reviews and fulfills a requirement, I'd suggest giving other courses stronger consideration. I don't exactly regret taking this class, but I think I could have chosen better.\nDr. Gravano curves the median to a B+ or A-. You may be thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sure, I'll just score above average!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but in a 90 something class full of smart people and easy assignments and tests, this is tricky to do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there is a good component of luck involved.\nThe two tests which comprise 50% of your grade are themselves comprised of about 40% (each) true false questions. That's 20% of your grade roughly!  I felt that some of them were vaguely worded and it's pretty hit or miss if you remember the specific fact the question tests you on.\nYou'll either need a very good memory or be very planned and careful how you review the lectures, because you really could get tested on any bullet point in them. It's fair and doable, but that's not my style. I'd rather be tested on my ability to apply what I learned to solve problems than my ability to simply remember details about stuff I could recall by referring to the textbook or my notes (neither of which are allowed on the exams).  Oh, and the readings are often straight torture. Thankfully, I don't ever remember seeing a question that was in the reading but not the lecture. Much of the writing was by authors showing off their ability to encrypt simple concepts into Latex strings. Dr. Gravano's lectures blew the textbook out of the water.\nThe rest of the tests involve manually carrying out an algorithm he discussed in the lecture. The tests are easy, but I'm really not a fan of easy tests because mistakes will cost you a lot more. But that's obviously my opinion... you might think otherwise. \nThe HWs (java or python) certainly aren't trivial, but they aren't complicated either. The class generally averaged 9/10 on them with a very small standard deviation. I think I learned more about Python than I did about search algorithms or the subject matter of the class while doing the assignments. The first and last project implemented an algorithm that is probably only a step or two above the complexity of what you would encounter in an undergraduate data structures class at a reasonably competitive school. The second project mostly involved string formatting and learning how to use the API to google's open knowledge database. Personally, I found it pretty tedious. \nThis is not to say the assignments can be finished in two days. The API in the second project took forever to figure out, but I'd really rather invest my energy somewhere other than learning an API I won't use again in the foreseeable future. \nIn the grand scheme of things, this is not a bad class. Good for some people, less so for others. As you can tell by the other positive reviews, some folks do enjoy it. I see where they are coming from. Some of the things I don't like about the class are a matter of personal taste. I hazard to say you will likely get your tuition's worth on this class. If you are NLP or ML I think you almost certainly will. I'm just saying this class isn't for everyone.\nWorkload:\nThe workload is medium-light. If you are taking some insanity classes like OS or cloud computing, this might be worth using to pad your credits to full time so you don't overstress yourself but still learn a few things -- but again, give other courses some consideration.\n"

He's very receptive to questions in class and often responds to questions both via e-mail and the discussion board, which is rare in my experience.\nHe uses slides (available online) for much of the introductory portion of the course, but often switches to the blackboard to work out particular examples. The latter half of the course was taught almost entirely on the blackboard. \nCorresponding book sections are listed for each lecture, but going to class or having a friend to take notes for you is important, as he sometimes he covers more or less material than is presented in the corresponding book chapters. The textbook (Ramakrishnan + Gehrke, 3e) is quite good, despite the many reviews you'll find online saying otherwise.\nWhile you will get a project mentor for your two projects, in reality there will be very little interaction with the TAs unless you seek it.\n\nWorkload:\n4 equally-weighted homework assignments (15%)\n1 large project + demo (15%)\n1 small project (5%)\n1 midterm (25%)\n1 final (40%)\nThe homeworks are light and occasionally add to the concepts covered in class. Projects are done in groups of two. The first project has multiple phases and takes place over a large span of time. The second project is short.\nThe majority of the class obtains perfect or near-perfect marks on the homeworks and projects. The exams will be the differentiating factor.\n\n"

Don't be fooled, though -- this is only because he teaches so well (I made the mistake of being lulled into a state of overconfidence and skipped out on a few lectures, and I'm paying for it now just before the final!). \nGravano clearly knows his stuff and can answer any question you might have - if you ever have a doubt, don't hesitate to ask him a question because after he's through explaining, you'll wonder how you were *ever* confused.\nWorkload:\nTwo group projects (two teammates) - quite time-consuming, but definitely help you learn the material\nFour homework assignments - tough but fair and good for learning the material (which is useful because these are good indications of exam questions!)\nA midterm and a final - if you attend lectures and review all of the concepts before taking them, you'll be fine.

He generally follows quality texts in his lectures and easily outperforms them in terms of the ease with which the material is presented.  His homeworks and exams are reasonably challenging but also completely fair -- don't worry if you get a 60% on an exam because it will come out in the curve.\nFurthermore, he always knows what he's talking about (more than some professors) as a result of an expansive knowledge of all aspects of databases thus far.  Now that I have gotten to know him better, it seems this stems from a more passionate interest in the subject than I've seen with others in their respective fields and it leads to a genuine desire to help students really master the material.\nI would definitely recommend taking the 6111 course if 4111 was at all interesting.\nWorkload:\nReasonable workload, but group projects are easily do-\nable on one's own.  Homeworks can be tricky and are a fair extension of concepts in class.  Exams are generally pretty difficult, but it shows in the curve.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Gravano is great as a person, and puts much effort on teaching, but for reasons I can't even try to understand, he also puts great effort in making even the most basic concepts ungraspable and obscure - obscure in the sense that they appear like irrelevant details that won't help you one bit in getting through the course, let alone a job interview.\nThe first half of the course dealt with DB design and SQL coding, and was relatively easy,\nthanks in great part to the self-explanatory, standard flow charts used for DB design and to the equally obvius SQL code. The second half deals with DB I/O cost analysis, and was difficult enough for Prof. Gravano to turn into - take your pick - Derridean post-modern literary theory or Martian rocket science. Even in the project assignments the most obvious concepts were mangled into research paper theory filler - my project team mate, who sailed through the course, kept wondering why on earth the guy would go to such lenghts to turn the clear and easy into the hermetic and impossible. \nAgain, I never had any doubt that Prof. Gravano was putting more than enough effort on the class, considering that as a top scientist on the field he had a busy enough schedule, but the obscurity of his explanations made lectures a tough going, until by the second half he was making jokes about everyone falling asleep. The blank looks he was getting by then contrasted with the sincere interest everyone had on the course material before the midterm, when his challenges and questions started such debates, he had to stop and ask people to quiet down. \nThis is one of the few courses in which the difficult textbook proves more useful than the overflowing PP slides or the teacher's talk. The TA I was assigned for the project appeared to get kicks out of taking points for the most trivial mistakes, but then again, it is difficult to blame the teacher for such things - in fact he was the one who had to ask her to take it easy with the grading. \nWorkload:\nThe hw's were doable, the projects only passably difficult, but the tests were horribly difficult - unless you have a good memory, when rote memorization of concepts will make it possible for you to float through.\n"

The class is more than a standard db offering in terms of workload: you got to do two projects, a web based db app and another theory-type number cruncher (most db classes make you do that one big app as a term project). There's also homeworks, mostly easy, with an occasional twist. If you go to class, do the projects/homework and score above avg in the exams, you're guaranteed a B+. One caution sign I'd post is: don't ignore the prereqs. You *need* to know how to code, and you *need* to know some data structure stuff. Don't screw around on this one, or you'll run into trouble in the projects. Gravano is basically a good guy. He does his best to help you out (even tho he appears touchy in class when cellphones ring, laptops ping etc, and you got to get used to the self-deprecating humor bit.) He's cool in office hours and email too (he gave several important hints on the second project ... this was a *huge* help after I spent like a whole weekend going blind on the numbers.) Overall, low stress class and he's a decent guy.\nWorkload:\n2 projects, 5 homeworks, midterm, final\n"
