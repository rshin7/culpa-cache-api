            "review_content": "\nGiven the last review for Professor Nieh was written in 2013, I figured it is worth to share some more thoughts on this class.\nThis class is everything they say it is. Nieh will teach you everything you need to know about Operating Systems, and then some more. His lectures are fast-paced, dense and sometimes difficult to keep track of. However, he is a very good lecturer with an impressive command over the material. He will answer several questions during class, which sometimes gets frustrating as he digresses. If you pay attention, you will learn a lot, but you will often have to back up the concepts with the textbook to actually master the material.\nAnd then there are the homeworks. Oh God. Nieh will talk about the concepts in class and he will talk about the homeworks a little bit, but to be honest, you are all alone. They involve writing code into the Linux kernel. Not only do you have to read A LOT (I mean, A LOT) of C code to figure out what you need to do, you also have to be really good at C to actually implement what's expected of you in a reasonable amount of time. Expected to spend 10 hours figuring out what you actually need to do before you write a single line of code. Expect to actually skip homework on other classes to finish these assignments. They will make you a great coder (especially if you want to be a systems programmer), and you will actually master reading Linux source code by the end, but it's a ridiculously rough patch. You will also have to demo your completed homework to a TA after it is done.\nHere are the breakdown of each of the programming assignments:\n   - Writing a bash shell. This one is the only individual programming assignment and also the only one not involving kernel programming. It is probably the easiest to do, but it'll still take around ~10 hours to finish. I see this more as a weed-out assignment for the students who aren't as confident in C.\n   - Writing a system call to keep track of Android's interprocess communications. This is the first time you will write code for the Linux kernel and also the first time you will write a system call. It's not actually that difficult, but takes a lot to get used to the programming environment.\n   - Writing an interface that sleeps selected Android processes and makes them wait on designated light intensity levels. The main emphasis here is concurrency / synchronisation. Starting from this assignment, you will actually be using a physical Android device, which Nieh makes you buy. Expect to pay a total of $200 as a group of three. \n   - Writing a process scheduler for Linux. This is easily the most difficult assignment in the class. Most of the teams actually didn't do it and dropped the assignment. My team spent over 30 hours and still got a failing grade. I'd still recommend you to attempt it, since you may be tested on the homework.\n   - Exposing process memory to the user. This is the assignment that has to do with memory and paging in Linux. Conceptually can be a pain to figure out, but it's not actually a lot of lines of code. There are some weird Linux-related bugs which slowed us down, so expect to find hacky ways around them.\n   - Writing a file system for Linux. This wasn't that bad because the TA's set the homework up pretty well, but just like all the other homeworks, it's again a lot of time.\nDon't expect the grading to be nice because the homeworks are hard. We were constantly tested on weird edge cases that we didn't think of. Nieh expects the highest of you despite how difficult it is to even set up the groundwork for a lot of these assignments.\nTA's: Some are very good and some are very bad. Don't expect office hours to be helpful, they are overcrowded and if there are students scheduled to demo their homeworks, you won't get to even ask questions.\nTextbooks: There are two. One is very helpful for programming for the Linux kernel, especially early on. The other is helpful for the written components of the homeworks and for studying for the midterm and the final. If you could get one, get the Linux programming one.\nBoth of the tests are also difficult, with class averages around 50-60 percentiles. You may be asked on anything you did for this class, from the lectures to the homeworks.\nFinally, grading is OK with a mean around B+, but you leave feeling it could be more generous given how much work and patience this class expects of you to even get a score around the mean. Despite all of that, if you do your work, you will learn an incredible amount about operating systems, C, Linux, systems programming, concurrency, and even more.\nWorkload:\n(50% ) 6 homework assignments. There's a group component, which focuses on programming for the Linux kernel, each of which takes easily more than 20 hours of your time to finish (and often more). There's also an individual written component, which actually takes a maximum of 2 hours to finish.\n(20%) Midterm. Included writing out programs and short answer questions. Doable but not easy.\n(30%) Final, included programming, true or false questions and short answers. Final this semester was ridiculously difficult.\n"

            "review_content": "\nA benchmark class, indeed. I am happy that I took it and improved my \"C\" programming skills, especially in the OS domain. Prof. Jason Nieh teaches the course very well.\nApart from the skills and experience in the areas - Operating Systems, Linux kernel programming, this course demands a lot of your \"C\" skills.\nIf you are a HardCore \"C\" fan and would love to experiment at system level in \"C\", then read on!\nThis one class is for those who crave for \"C\" programming a lot! You will get your hands dirty while building crucial features of Linux kernel on an Android device in \"C\" involving Synchronization, Scheduling, Paging, File Systems, etc(as per the projects in Fall 2012).\nYou will fine tune your \"C\" skills yourselves mainly in the area of optimizing the usage of the kernel resources in terms of memory. You keep an eye on what each function ends up returning to determine its success or failure - this comes with practice if you aren't in the habit!\nThe grading rubric is the most comprehensive one I have ever seen in my life. For each of the assignments/homework, the rubric would cover every nook and corner cases that a novice \"C\" programmer for Linux kernel would definitely ignore.\nWell, in the beginning you would find each of your submission being bitten by checkpatch, for not abiding by Linux kernel coding style. But, with time, your \"C\" coding style becomes smooth and elegant if you start respecting what that seemingly strict master(checkpatch) says, trust me!\nAh, userspace programs for each of the assignments! Well, I enjoyed much by dwelling in \"C\" while building the user space test programs for testing the Linux kernel features implemented in each of the assignments. You would be asked to demo each of the Linux kernel features you would implement in each homework and during the demo, well, how dedicated you were in testing your code gets rewarded when the standard test code(which they would have in their repositories) completes without any problem and you hear TA saying, \"That's cool!\".\nTAs were very helpful in answering the questions we had. Sometimes, we had to bug them and get the information what we want - but, they were all nice and had good hold on the subject. Among them, I found through live and piazza discussions, TA - Alex to be damn good in the subject.\nI feel it's important to mention that the solutions they would publish are simply beautiful. The solutions implemented by Christoffer Dall were mesmerizing. No, am not exaggerating at all - his coding style is so pleasing to eye and his code looks very simple and precise!\nPeer reviews: Yes, you would get opportunities(or responsibilities?) to review and grade other people's code. Here, I was annoyed at certain times of seeing some seriously senseless code from other people. At other times, I had also the chance to look at some brilliant code. So, overall, there was a good exchange of knowledge and suggestions between our team and various teams.\nYeah, btw, try to form a good competent team - believe me, it's better to have arguments and come up with some kick-ass code which scores beyond the average code resulting from an average interaction or no interaction at all between you and your teammates. And this is from my experience!\n\nWorkload:\nNormal if you and your teammates are damn good in \"C\" and kernel programming, and heavy otherwise.\n"

His classes are great, even if you miss in person, you can view them on CVN later. It was really helpful.\nIf you are lazy to work because you have a job already and just want to pass this course, then you might not like working so much, but otherwise if you have genuine desire to learn operating systems, you will be grateful to Prof Nieh.\nAssignments are challenging and you will spend time reading linux kernel code. Best resource to get help is good TAs. For our course TAs were really good and helpful. I spent almost few hours with them before doing any assignment and it helped.\nCool thing about this course is that if you do assignments on your own and are able to finish it, you will become good enough to answer any question on kernel that you are expected to know and even more.\nMake good teams for your assignment. If you have problems with team mates better change team, hire or fire someone else you will end up struggling alone and that doesnt help.\nJust remain above average in exams, assignments and your grades will be great. If you outdo  average in all cases you will get a very good grade.\nWorkload:\nHeavy but worthwhile if you really want to understand your operating system well.\n"

The workload is about 30-40 hours per week on project weeks, almost none on off weeks. And there are like two off weeks. \nThe course itself, as in the things you get examined on, is actually relatively simple. There are two components: a concepts component, which you can get entirely from reading the textbook, and a practice component, which consists of endless hours of reading through C source code, followed by more hours of implementing your design, followed by a frantic 24 hour code marathon once you finally figure out what you were supposed to be doing from the start. \nSome prerequisites: Firstly, you need to know C really, really well. I mean like, you need to be able to write memory-safe in C in your sleep. You will be taught thread and interrupt safety in the course itself. \nMore importantly, you need to be able to read C code. There is no manual for the Linux kernel. It's C all the way down (well no, it turns into assembly at some point...) I mean, yeah there are some documentation notes, but the real deal is the code. If you can't figure out what a method is doing in one glance, you're going to have to brush up on your sight reading. \nOh and also, the projects are based around modifying the Android Linux kernel. I mean, how cool is that! \nWorkload:\nOh sweet Jesus. Like I said before, the workload is crushing. On the bright side, though, you will be working as a team, so you can always opt to cling like a remora to your teammate's work. If laziness is not your thing, you'd better get the lead out, because this class will make the rest of your classes look wimpy. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis course is the best CS course I have ever taken.\nI entered the course with very little C experience and with hardly any Linux experience - let alone any kernel programming experience. After taking this course I did a project for the professor next semester and I now feel confident to take on large kernel intensive projects.\nFurther, even if you're not going to be an operating systems developer, taking this course will make you understand all those details, which are unavoidably important, but always seem vague without having real OS experience - such as memory management, device drivers, threads and processes and more. I have taken another OS course before this at another institution, and I have to say that a course like this should be mandatory for all CS students.\nJason is an excellent teacher, who is very approachable and answers any question with insight and dedication, so take this course with him if you have the chance.\nOnly criticism is that I think there should be a homework related to writing a driver/module instead of for instance changing the scheduler, as it is more relevant for most of the kernel work to be done by the majority of people. Also, the classes do seem a little slow at times, but I guess that's more of personal preference.\nWorkload:\nRegarding the workload, yes, it is VERY tough. The homeworks will kill you, and if you have little C and linux experience it will be even worse. As another reviewer wrote: do some C programming practice before starting this course! Also, pick a good teammate and plan the entire semester for homeworks (including which homework to possibly skip) from the beginning. The midterm and final are not over the top difficult, but will require knowledge of what you are doing. (The questions are relevant though and not to test-like).\nDon't let the workload scare you off, but don't take this course together with other core-courses - you will suffocate :)\n"

The famous 6 Linux kernel homeworks were just as time-consuming as could be expected. However the Prof and the TA:s were very helpful and there is a good discussion board belonging to the class. It was possible to skip one homework without a grade penalty. The first two assignments were not that difficult but 3-6 was very challenging.\nThe exams were in general pretty straight-forward if you had attended the lectures during the semester. The lectures however were rather slow and somewhat obstructed by irrelevant questions. The level of the lectures were much lower than what was required to finish the homeworks.\nThe best advice I can give for this class is to preferrably get familiar with C and Linux as much as possible before starting the class. No previous kernel programming experience is necessary but not having to spend time with syntax problems is very nice. \nBut anyone interested in low-level programming should definately take this class.\nWorkload:\nThe assignments took us on average up to 40 hours each.\n\nIn addition there is some reading to do and lectures to go to.

Work not so hard and, well, you'll know the theory fairly well, but that's about it. This class requires a highly intimate knowledge of C--if you don't know it very well, then either skip the class or be prepared to read the K&R; book thoroughly.\nThe course covers the internals of the Linux kernel and we worked specifically with 2.6.11. Nieh covers mostly theory in class, and there is one text which goes over theory in more detail, and one which is a god-awful dry textbook (more like a manual, actually). The assigned readings aren't that long, and you will definitely need to do them--otherwise you will have no idea what the hell is going on. That being said, his lectures compliment the readings very nicely. Nieh was one of my better profs in terms of not \"teaching out of the book.\" However--Nieh is the person you go to if you don't understand theory. If you need help with the homework, skip him and go to the TAs directly (he has little involvement in the homeworks).\nFor each homework, you write a patch to the kernel that does something. After you submit, you have to meet with the TA for ~30 minutes to demo it, and they will also run their own test program on it. Be careful as they are NOT AT ALL forgiving if anything goes wrong--if you can't get it to work (even for a stupid error like you submitted the wrong file), you lose practically all points. Also, each HW has a written portion (~10 questions, usually 50% of the grade).\nHWs:\n1. Basic stuff, write a small shell, etc.\n2. syscall logger: not that hard, just an introduction to syscalls/the virtual machines you'll be using\n3. waitqueues/locking/threading stuff: you don't have to write that much code, just be careful what exactly you write.\n4. implemented a new scheduler type. most of the class just skipped this HW entirely, i recommend you give it a shot, but, don't bother if you can't get it.\n5. memory tracker: write a syscall that can track what chunks of memory you're using. requires you to go low-level with page tables, etc. tough but doable.\n6. process tree filesystem: make a filesystem that reflects the processes on a system. it's a lot easier than it sounds; he gives some examples of other pseudo filesystems in class.\nWorkload:\n6 homeworks, 1 midterm, 1 final. Best 5 out of 6 homeworks used. Be careful - each homework could be considered a workload you would put into a project for another class. The midterm and final were both standard: he has a review session for each where he goes over old ones. The exams you take will be different, so you can't just study the old ones and be fine, but they're aren't THAT tricky.\n"

An able CS undergrad would spend anywhere between 10 to 20 hours a week on the homeworks (written + programming parts combined). Nieh's lectures are very straightforward, and they are very much worth attending. The class is all about *detail* -- for those in systems, there is mounds of it to drum into your head, and this class gives you good practice. The worst part of the class is not the homework, but the morons that you can be potentially be paired up with for doing the programming assignments.  Your partner may contribute nothing, yet s/he can get all of the credit for your hard work.

Either hold your breath and scrap together a B, or split up with your boyfriend/girlfriend and move into the lab... just be glad that not all teachers care so little about coddling you as Nieh does. Hopefully, you'll actually learn something in the process, as he knows the material inside-out. And if Linux is old Hat for you, you might possible find yourself enjoying the class.  But not likely -- Nieh, like so many other cs profs, confuses a ridiculous 'sink-or-swim' approach for academic rigor.  He should wake up and face teaching like an adult; you should avoid him.\n"

His lectures are one of the better ones here at Columbia, and you'll actually learn a lot - BUT, you really need to be awake and ready to participate, as he likes to shoot off questions, and expects you to be able to answer them. He is willing to help outside of class, but make sure you have your questions ready, as he tends to get frustrated if you go to him and don't have a clue about what you need/want to know. As far as homework goes, the theory part is fine, but the programming part is NOT. When I took Data Structures with him, only 3 of 50 or so students was able to finish one of the later homeworks... he really expects you to know how to code (god knows where you're supposed to have learned!). Thankfully, his tests are more manageable (mostly due to the fact you don't have to code!).\nWorkload:\nIncreasingly difficult homeworks, midterm, final.\n"
