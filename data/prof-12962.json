            "review_content": "\nShe is old. Period. \nBy old I mean she was probably on a boat with Columbus when he first discovered America\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcompletely old-school. She's the type of teacher that could struggle with microsoft powerpoint for almost 20 minutes while being oblivious to whatever's going on in the classroom. She makes exams completely numerically tedious. By that I mean she fails to make nice numbers on the exam, so students end up having to punch in 8 decimal numbers just to get an answer. Most students can't finish the exam because someone doesn't know how to make nicer exams.\nShe completely reads off slides word for word. One plus side to this is that she doesn't expect you to know anything from the book\u00e2\u20ac\u201donly the stuff on her slides. She stops frequently for questions while being unperceptive to the fact that more than half of the class is either comatose or completely clueless. She tried very hard to keep class entertained by completely reading off from slides in a fruitless attempt to save time each class for kids to deliver their findings on news items. These presentations count towards the class participation points but most kids just eff it. \nShe is responsive to emails and that being said, should be the main tool of communication between students and her since she doesn't have time to answer questions after class. She is a stickler to the rules and refuses to give extensions for problem sets which she gives 3 days for students to complete. \nFinance is a field that is somewhat counterintuitive and judging by her style of teaching, or lack thereof, I would strongly advise against taking a class with her. \nOn a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate her a 2.1, as in take this class if you want to suffer pain equivalent to having tiny splinters in between your toes for the rest of your life. \nWorkload:\nheavy. Mostly catching up with the lectures and weekly news article presentations and problem sets. 2 midterms 1 cumulative final. 3 problem sets with 5 ambiguous questions.\n"
