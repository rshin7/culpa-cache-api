Her desk crits were inconsistent and her comments were never concrete enough so students were often left hanging in the air all confused and mystified. Classes always lagged behind the schedule and the quality of work produced was abysmally below standard compared to what was going on in Schwatzman's studio in the next aisle (ALL students, WITHOUT exception, appeared to produce portfolio-quality work in Schwatzman's studio). In short, avoid this professor at all costs; you will learn so little for so much that you pay. \nWorkload:\nDemanding but unfair compared to the very little that the professor dedicates to teaching\n"
