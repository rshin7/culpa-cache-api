            "review_content": "\nAfter a full semester attending most of the lectures and all of the discussion sections, I've concluded that this course organizationally makes absolutely no sense. The books themselves, however, are for the most part really entertaining and well worth reading.\nProfessor Gamber stated in no uncertain terms in the first two lectures, \"if you don't believe white privilege exists, this is not the course for you,\" which I would think would self-select a group of pretty \"social justice\"-minded students (myself among them). However, Professor Gamber spends the rest of the semester lecturing to this imaginary student he made it explicitly clear from the beginning he didn't want in the class. The result is lectures full of entry-level social justice statements (\"If you believe in equality between all genders, congratulations, you're a feminist.\"), which are usually redundant, kind of patronizing, and (as others have noted) often tangential to the actual book. Another reviewer wrote that Professor Gamber has a tendency to speak on behalf marginalized groups he is not a part of, which I would say is accurate. It can get pretty uncomfortable as a student of color in lecture, ironically.\nBecause Professor Gamber's lectures focus largely on critical theory and historical phenomena surrounding the book, discussion about the actual novels gets relegated to a 50 minute discussion section. I really liked my TA, but 50 minutes per novel wasn't nearly enough time to really delve into the books. Your TA really makes or breaks this course, because they hold the discussion sections, and they do all the grading \u2014 what was actually really frustrating was that Professor Gamber withheld information on the midterm and final formats (even from the TAs) until the last class before each. (Ultimately, both exams were pretty easy). Professor Gamber didn't even show up for the final exam, which I found pretty telling.\nIn general, I'd say Novels of Immigration is worth taking if you're really interested in the novels, because it's not at all a difficult course, and Professor Gamber's lectures, while pretty lackluster, aren't the real backbone of the course. I don't feel like it should count for Global Core, but apparently it does, so this seems like a fairly viable option. If you're in CSER or the English department, however, you'll likely find the course pretty bizarre and struggle to grasp what exactly you're meant to take away from it.\nAs for Professor Gamber specifically, if you have similar politics to him (you hate the Core's Eurocentrism, you want to destroy the white supremacist cisheteropatriarchy), you might enjoy a seminar-style class with him, wherein you can actually engage with the books and his arguments about them.\n\nWorkload:\n11 novels (about one a week), all from contemporary American authors.\nIt seems like the assignments for this class change dramatically from semester to semester, but here's what it was this time:\n25% Discussion Group participation\n25% Midterm (essentially a reading quiz testing your ability to ID short passages)\n25% 8-10 Page Paper (There's a creative option)\n25% Final (ID 4 of 6 Passages and write about 3 paragraphs about each)\n"

            "review_content": "\nGamber is glib, sarcastic, witty, funny, and well-rehearsed. He showed up to every class in a suite and tie, and his presentations were always perfectly prepared and executed.\nDespite that, things went wrong from day one: there weren't enough TAs for the course, so he had to cancel the mandatory discussion sections. This also meant he had to cancel one of the papers for the class. The books were all interesting, but Gamber really gives off the impression that he cares more about his research than his students. He flat out doesn't seem to care about reading the midterms. The midterm was writing three short essays on excerpts that were easy to identify if you came to lectures -- you didn't even need to read the books -- and was essentially graded on whether or not you 1) knew the title and author of the quote, and 2) could write more than one paragraph on it. Most of the students in the class seemed to get a perfect or near-perfect score.\nThe paper, though, was graded incredibly harshly, and the final was impossible. Like the midterm, the final was quotes that were far more obscure, and even people who read all of the books (I read most of them, but not all of them) had trouble identifying them.\nOh, and he also claimed that he automatically failed 15% of the class for not handing the paper in on time, no exceptions. So there's that as well. He doesn't really have time for bullshit, but he also doesn't seem to care how much we're absorbing other than if we have read the books. The problem is this: all he cared about was reading the books, but the class soon became so much more than the books. They were jumping off points for a larger discussion on race and movement in America post-1965, which is amazing and interesting, but so much of his lectures had nothing to do with what we were being graded on.\nJust read the books yourself. Most of them are pretty short, and they're by and large really good.\nWorkload:\nMidterm exam, which was a joke.\nLong (8-10 page) paper, graded super duper harshly\nFinal exam, which was a miserable experience\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class was not good, and Professor Gamber does not (in any way) deserve a gold nugget. I don't know how many negative reviews he needs before CULPA changes that.\nLike many reviewers have already said, while the books and lectures were enjoyable, the lectures were only superficial and very rarely succeeded to expand my understanding of the text or of the issues at large. Truly all he did was dramatically read long quotes from the texts without any substantial analysis. He runs through many different literary elements that were present in the text without every really connecting them to issues of immigration/relocation or explaining them thoroughly. I have come out of this class not really knowing anything more about literature about movement than I did at the beginning. \nThe assessments and grading were horrific. I understand that he had a problem at the beginning with his TA's, but that's really no excuse. It's absurd that the midterm essays were graded out of 5, with two of those points awarded for identifying the author and title. There absolutely should have been more than one paper, worth 40% of the final grade, so we could have improved our writing and more fully understood what the professor and TA's were looking for. The grading was very harsh, almost to an arbitrary extent. The final was god-awful, as others have already explained, despite the fact that I really did read all of the books. All of this is to say that the exams and papers in absolutely no way assessed what we learned in the course. \nProf. Gamber may be a nice person, but he does not seem to be a particularly good professor, and I implore you to reconsider before taking this class. \nWorkload:\nSee below.\n"

            "review_content": "\ntl;dr: Gamber as a person = humorous, witty, all around a good guy. This class was a nightmare logistically and impacted the experience, but that was mostly beyond his control and is probably a one-time thing. More Global Core than English, great books, really tough paper, reasonable exams (though my opinion on the exams seems to be an outlier).\nGamber's funny, knows his shit, isn't afraid to call people out on their bullshit, etc. He has flair & timing, so his delivery of his lectures were always great.\nThe selection of books is great. I really enjoyed most of the novels, and managed to finish all of them because I genuinely wanted to.\nAs for the class itself: a lot of things went wrong for it on the administrative side, unfortunately. They couldn't find enough TAs for the class, so mandatory recitations were cancelled. Because of this, the entire grading system had to be changed. Gamber was really frustrated by this; you could tell that this was not the way he wanted to teach the class. He believes lectures are the worst way to teach a humanities class, but he ultimately got stuck teaching a class that could only be a lecture. I think this definitely damaged what the class had the potential to be, but I also don't believe this should reflect badly of Gamber, when it was out of his control.\nLectures would usually start with background on the novel. Then he'd pull a few quotes related to whatever theme he was focused on, dramatically read the quote, and discuss the theme more. This class did feel more Global Core than English at times, as some previous reviews have said. He focuses much more on cultural/social/racial/gendered themes that were semi-obvious than actually analyzing the text and the language. Still, I learned a lot, even if it didn't exactly deliver as an *English* course.\nThe midterm was ridiculously easy: ID 3 of the 5 given passages and explain how it ties thematically/stylistically to the rest of the book. Basic stuff.\nThe paper: damn. Grading was really harsh. I can't tell if this is just representative of the TAs or if Gamber told them to be so rough. I've previously had Gamber for Lit Hum and he was easier on grading so, not really sure about this one. I regret not visiting the TAs more for help with the paper, I'm sure it would've helped me loads more. He gives you a list of pretty varied prompts, or you can come up with your own as long as it's cleared with him/the TAs.\nAlso--make sure you follow his instructions for the paper. Gamber was raging because 15% of the class either 1) didn't hand in the paper on time 2) didn't hand it in in the right location 3) wrote on an unlisted topic without getting it cleared. He then said he was going to give that 15% a 0 for not following instructions, no exceptions, effectively failing them. Not sure if this ever happened (I sure hope not). Either way, I still wouldn't even want to face the threat of this.\nThe final: I know previous reviews all have said the final was a bitch, but I didn't have much trouble with it. If you read all the books (and this wasn't a problem for most people I know in the class) and have a firm grasp on the themes, plot points, etc, it wasn't too difficult to discern which passages were from what books. It definitely wasn't easy, but it wasn't horrible either. Again, my experience may have been the exception on this.\nI agree though, that the midterm/final probably weren't great assessments of how much we actually learned/gained from the class. That probably was what the discussion sections went towards, but since they were cancelled, there was really no way for Gamber to gauge that for everyone in the class. I'm also pretty sure he thinks exams are stupid ways of testing, so he just didn't give a shit about the exams and basically tested on reading comprehension.\nDespite how weird it was this semester, I'd still recommend taking the class. Hopefully it'll be better in the future & discussion sections will be back in place.\nWorkload:\nmidterm (3 IDs & explain significance) - 30%\npaper - 40%\nfinal (20 quotes, ID 18 & explain how you ID'd them) - 30%\n"

            "review_content": "\nI went into this class with a very open mind, and I was sorely disappointed. Pretty much everything about this class was terrible except for (a) the books and (b) the lectures (in terms of style, not content). To elaborate\u2026\nFirst, this class is cross-listed as English and CSER, but don't be fooled. The class is not at all an English class -- it is basically a study of race using the books as jumping off points. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but don't expect high-level analysis of the texts.\nSecond, on his lectures. He is a vivid speaker and quite lively, but the substance just isn't there. The class is structured so that every week is a different book, for the most part. Usually, he spends the entire first lecture or more on inconsequential things such as: the author (because the books are all recent, the author is often just a random adjunct professor at a random university -- who cares?\u2014this often seems like he is trying to justify the importance of these obscure books and their authors), the historical background (again, it IS interesting, but not really related to how the class was presented), and the epigraphs (I'm sure we can all agree this one is a waste of time). After that hot mess, most of the lectures are him reading off slides. He is the kind of person that reads things emphatically and dramatically and believes it wholly alters the meaning of the words. In reality, he spends most of the time picking out important passages and reading quotes in an actor\u2019s voice while barely giving any original analysis. In this respect, I would say the class very closely resembles a high school English class. But, his presentation is immaculate, almost like a well-orchestrated sermon. So, the lectures for me were a mixed bag: They started off amazing, but as I became accustomed to the formula I quickly started to dread them. In short, while I would generally really enjoy the lectures as they were happening, afterward I would think back and realize I gained virtual nil from them.\nThird, the grading. The midterm was a total joke for not really any reason. Nearly everybody got a 9/10 or 10/10, and it is lunacy that the essays were graded out of 3. The long essay was graded way too harshly. Also, anybody who handed in the long essay a minute late was failed IN THE CLASS, which is major overkill. Thank God I was not in that boat. The final exam came out of the blue and was extremely difficult, again for seemingly no reason. It was essentially him picking out the most unidentifiable passages for us to ID (e.g., some books have Spanish every other word, and he purposefully found places where that wasn\u2019t the case; another example, none of the \u201cOscar Wao\u201d passages on the exam contained nerdy or Dominican references that pepper every other sentence). Basically, there was no rhyme nor reason to the grading system, and it seemed like he was making up the expectations as he went along.\nFor anybody considering this class, I will advise you: (a) You don\u2019t have to be super progressive to enjoy the course as long as you keep an open mind. (b) Go to the first lecture\u2014he is very consistent, so you will immediately be able to understand how the semester will be. And, (c) don\u2019t take this if your GPA is more to you than a number. This class IS a sandbag. (I hope I don\u2019t sound bitter\u2014I have been looking forward to this review cathartically for weeks now when all I had gotten back was a 10/10 for the midterm.)\nOne last parting jab: Gamber likes to pretend he is a speaker for ALL people of color, to a comical extent. He doesn\u2019t realize how transparent he is being, but he loves to artificially associate himself with the minorities in the books. For example, he will drop a comment like \u201ceverybody always pronounces this like X when it is really pronounced Y,\u201d as if he is the authority on Vietnamese or Muskogee or whatever. It is just embarrassing, part of his progressive pathology and acclamation of victimhood, so I hope he sees this and cease-and-desists. \n\nWorkload:\nMidterm Exam: 30%\nLong Paper (8-10 pages): 40%\nFinal Exam: 30%\n"

The books are incredible and the lectures worth attending; the way this class is graded is a mess. \nGamber is a glib, charismatic, and thoughtful lecturer, and I never regretted coming to class. He's fun to listen to! He usually spends two days on each book, with the first lecture more focused on author/historical context and the second on plot/themes/language/etc. The syllabus is expertly crafted, with a good mix of more popular texts (Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao) and things I had never heard of before (The Bird is Gone). I loved everything we read. If you\u2019re an English major, it fulfills your American and Prose requirements as well as counting for Global Core, which is great. \nThe way that this class was graded was really frustrating. One of the TAs dropped out at the beginning of the semester, so discussion sections were canceled. We were supposed to write a 5-page paper earlier in the semester that also got canceled, which put a lot more pressure on the midterm, final, and final paper. \nMidterm was fine\u2014passage ID/short essay. Lots of options for the final paper topic, and TAs were really helpful, answering emails and holding extra office hours. (As far as I can tell, the TAs did all the grading in this class.)\nThe final was awful. I\u2019ve taken a good number of English finals at Columbia, and this one was just *bad*. We had to identify 20 short, obscure quotes (from 11 books), and give the title, author, and one sentence about how we knew the quote was from that book. No literary analysis at all; it was basically a glorified reading quiz. I kind of feel like Gamber sensed people hadn\u2019t been doing the reading as much as he wanted them to, and decided to punish us with this joke of a test. I read all the books and couldn\u2019t identify all the quotes, and they definitely weren\u2019t all quotes we discussed in class. \nHopefully a lot of these problems were particular to this semester\u2014as far as I can tell this was the first semester that canceled mandatory recitation sections, had no shorter paper, and gave a final that was a train wreck of super short IDs rather than a more thoughtful assessment of our understanding and analysis of the texts. \nBottom line: Wonderful books, great lectures, frustrating grading. Take this class if you have time to read everything twice because the final's a doozy. \nWorkload:\n-Book a week\n-Midterm (pretty mild) \n-Final paper \n-Atrocious final exam\nCanceled: Recitation sections and a shorter paper \n"

He often criticizes Columbia, for example because Butler library is named after a white man. If he dislikes this place so much, why did he accept the job offer? To fight the system from within?

The reading list (for the most part) contained really fascinating books.

I think everyone, if not mostly everyone, felt that they could truly express what they thought about the books, the characters, the plots, etc without feeling hesitation or reproach from the professor. \nHe also was willing to change the reading assignments when he realized that they were too long and maybe unmanageable. This demonstrates that  the he maybe wanted to have good discussions (which I take more away from), as opposed to just \"teaching\" the material. \nStupendously-amazing class. So seriously, take any class with him. \n\nWorkload:\nGreat, manageable readings (something like 1 short book per class or half a book, if longer); one weekly response; one 8-10 pager. \n"

            "review_content": "\n     John Gamber is by far the best professor at Columbia. He is engaging and excellent at leading and allowing the students to influence the direction of class discussions. He is well versed and knowledgeable about the books in the syllabus and context of the texts above and beyond whats written on the pages. Immigration, Relocation and Diaspora met twice a week and it always felt like there wasn't enough time to discuss everything we wanted to discuss. I'd have to admit that leaving class each day was always a little difficult because our class time honestly felt too precious and worthwhile to wrap up. Participation is key, as it is 25% of your grade, and one of the largest ways you will get anything out of the course. If you take any class by Professor Gamber it is guaranteed that you will look forward to attending class each day. Most, if not all days felt like we weren't even attending a class at all. The class was like a weekly enchanting book club, always leaving you with a new profound thought or idea as you left.\n   The catch however is that there is usually a required reading of one book a week. Yes, I know it sounds like a lot, but they are not your everyday, mundane selections of the western canon with critical acclaim. As a person who loves to read, I would admit to gaining a new collection of all time favorite books through this classes' syllabus. Although I am someone who often gets away with doing little to no reading for a class, I will be quite honest when I say I read and enjoyed reading every bit of the page turning books we were assigned to read. The plot and endings of the books always left you breathless, gently putting the book down, and feeling a smile slowly run across your face. I would highly encourage this class to anyone and everyone who loves to read and talk about the depth to which books are able to connect to the everyday lives of us, our peers, and citizens of the world. John Gamber was phenomenal in his teaching as a global citizen, and will genuinely leave you feeling like a brand new person. \nWorkload:\nAverage one book a week, some longer than others. Weekly reading responses after you've finished the books of 1-2 pages double-spaced. An in class midterm of passage id's + critical analysis -very fair and straightforward if you've gone to class and done the readings. A final paper that is very flexible with options for essay topics including media outlets or even creating a fictional narrative, 8-10 pages double spaced.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis is a review for: Immigration, Relocation, and Diaspora\nThis literature class focuses on minority authors who have written about their immigrant/relocated/diasporic communities.The novels are AMAZING. I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into when I signed myself up for this class because I don't enjoy reading. I don't read for fun, I barely read for classes,and I didn't think I would all pick up these books to read/participate. There ended up being only 4 people in the class, including myself. I READ ALL OF THE BOOKS AND I LOVED THEM. The 5 of us would have informal discussions about these interesting/beautifully written books. Every class I went to I was excited for. Professor Gamber is brilliant and very personable. He never shut our ideas down and was easy to talk to about anything. This class has been the best class I've taken at Columbia by FAR.\n\nWorkload:\nWeekly responses on the books, in class midterm, 8-10 pg paper for the final.\n"
