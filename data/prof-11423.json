The IEOR department informed me that they will be choosing a new professor for next year.  The TA's were awful human beings that looked as if they wanted to shoot your before they shot themselves.  \nI believe no one wanted to be in that room.  The \"special\" presenters were also quacks filled with fluff.  These people belong in the Business School and not in Fu.\nDo not take a class with Jack.  Fortunately, those who sign up for this class next year won't have to worry.\nWorkload:\n10 pages per week\n40-60 page business plan final\n3 presentations\nNOT WORTH IT!!\n"
