Some lectures can\nfeel a bit superficial as they speed through large chunks of\ntime.  Professor Philliou balances that with a reading list full of journal\narticles and excerpts from advanced monographs, as well\nas some interesting primary source readings.\nShe is at her best when responding to questions during\nlecture\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand there were a lot of good questions from\nadvanced undergraduates and grad students.  That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when\nshe can slow down and go into depth for a few minutes, and \nyou see that she is smart, really knows the scholarship in her\nfield, and has a lively intellect and gentle sense\nof humor. \nIt would be better if she could split this course into\ntwo semesters, but until then, grab it when it comes\naround next time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good solid course.\n\nWorkload:\nMidterm, final, end-of-term project, separate discussion sections with a TA most weeks.  Reading list is somewhat lengthy and aimed at serious students of history, \n\n"

            "review_content": "\nI read the previous review, and agree for the most part. Except for the part where the reviewer said that she was smart. I was not impressed by how \"intelligent\" she was by any stretch. It felt like much of the class just consisted of her regurgitating what she had been taught in CC. Any opinions different from her own, whether they were relevant or irrelevant to the class, were shut down completely and often shut down in a mean way.\nI would even go so far as to say that she is downright nasty when it comes to anything that doesn't go her way (i.e. missing a makeup class that was scheduled at the last minute because one had Friday plans). If you want a fictional representation of her, I would use Delores Umbridge from Harry Potter. Passive aggressive to the max.\nAlso, if you have an ongoing problem, she won't speak to you about it until the day of the final, where she basically just tells you that you're screwed. That's how much Professor Philliou cares about her students. \nOne last thing. She forgot to schedule a midterm. YES! SHE FORGOT TO SCHEDULE A MIDTERM! And then randomly added one that was obviously \"If you take it, I'll like you and give you a good final grade. And if you don't, I'll say it won't matter, but it will somehow count toward participation.\"\nWorkload:\nEasy. Two short papers and final.\n"

Avoid at all costs. \nProfessor Philliou is a Columbia Alum, so from what I gather, she at least read the texts then, but seems to have put minimal effort in since. She occasionally came to class with a sheet of paper with dates scribbled on it to give us some historical perspective, but used student presentations to begin class rather than anything she prepared. She was then confused when discussions seemed to faulter as she encouraged them by shutting people down whose responses she found even minorly irrelevant. On top of that, she really has it in for any student she thinks is slacking off in class. She is also really into classroom decorum and respect for her authority as...an assistant professor that no one's ever heard of? I gathered from reading her bio that she has done some impressive research on the ottoman empire and I could tell she was an intelligent person in class with plenty of insights on the reading. However she only occasionally shared them and did not create a productive classroom dynamic. She is passive agressive, lazy, and unkind. \nWorkload:\nManagable. Two short papers, an optional midterm, and a final that wasn't too difficult. \n"

Our class environment was extremely comfortable and she had a way of breaking everything down and putting it all together in a way that I often found simply remarkable with many of the texts. She is a great professor with an extensive knowledge of history but she is also very approachable and seems very happy to be teaching - a combination often difficult to find here. Grading was extremely fair - not overly generous, not too soft. \nWorkload:\nNormal\n"

I was completely NOT qualified to be in her seminar, but it was brand new, and beggars can't be choosers when it comes to filling seats. To say I was pleasantly suprised would be an understatement.  Prof. Philliou was VERY knowledgeable, and yet never came across as pedantic.  She has a direct manner when it comes to bringing up salient points, and allowed all students to bring something to the table.  Sure, you had your students like me who knew practically nothing (ugh, and even the ones who wanted to talk anyway), but for the most part, the class stayed focused on the texts (which were interesting).  Actually, it was the sort of warm, fuzzy seminar where the class bonds and likes each other- even though everyone was very different (GS students, grad students, even a sophmore).  I highly recommend her classes, and predict she will be one of the great professors.\nWorkload:\nPretty typical for a seminar.  One short paper (3-5), one long paper(15-17), heavy reading, one in-class presentation of texts.\n"
