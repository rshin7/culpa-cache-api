If the class is offered again with her as TA, take her over Kevin if at all possible. However, section is optional and since Marcia Wright likely retired I have no idea what the future of this class is. \n"

Not only is she very approachable, but she really knows what she's talking about and is great at distilling dense reading assignments.  She's also very helpful with brainstorming paper topics.  Consider yourself lucky if you get Amanda as your TA. \n"
