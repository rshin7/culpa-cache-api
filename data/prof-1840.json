She is an AWSOME teacher. Though appearing unbelievably intimidating at the start of the semester, she turned out to be a real softy.  When she realized that some of the readings were excessive, she changed the syllabus and she always gave us extensions if we needed them. Moreover, she is a really smart, critical woman who want us to improve our writing skiils.  Anybody who gets this class is definitely blessed by the register gods. \nWorkload:\nLots of reading, lots of writing, and she's a tough but fair grader \n"
