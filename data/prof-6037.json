            "review_content": "\nEdith lacks focus and doesn't stick the syllabus.  Often the class is about her making up as she goes along.  In this course, she makes you get a New York Times subscription and then tries to teach you how to read it.  Being that this is a graduate-level and mandatory class in the School of Continuing Education's Communications Practice program, you should know how to read one already.\nHer grading is arbitrary and she plays favorites.  Most of all, she's a disappointment to the Columbia community at-large and didn't seem to match up when comparing her to colleagues and faculty. Her expectations are unclear and left most students wondering what they learned.\n\nWorkload:\nMedia diaries every week that ARE NOT casual.  You must have them perfectly written at an academic level; she does not clarify this, so be forewarned.  Don't bother buying the book, she doesn't discuss it much.  You're better off avoiding this program altogether and opting for something more legit, like a real Columbia graduate program.\n"
