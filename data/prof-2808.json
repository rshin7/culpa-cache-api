            "review_content": "\nGenerally a great class. Lectures were fairly straightforward though some were better than others. It is the only class I have ever had in which I actually enjoyed writing the papers, which allowed me to develop my thoughts. Albert Narath was extremely friendly and enthusiastic, which really helped the course be great. He's the type of instructor who is not so strict about deadlines or that you answer every one of the questions from the essay topic, but rather that you learn as much as possible.\nOverall, I gained an appreciation of art from this class that I had not had before. It was also not particularly difficult. \nWorkload:\n3 out of 4 papers. Easy midterm. Instead of a final, he made us do recordings which were supposed to be similar to the audio-guides at the Met. These were fun and also conveniently gave us one less final to take. \n"
