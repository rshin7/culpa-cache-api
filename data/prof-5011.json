He would sometimes ask questions, at which point the 15 students wake up.  We all know the answer since he doesn't actually teach us anything new, but we have no idea what he has just asked so we always have to ask him to repeat himself.\nI could go on, but save yourself from the worst professor I have had at Columbia.\nWorkload:\nNone\n"
