            "review_content": "\nThis was one of the best seminars I've taken at Columbia. The first class I think turned some people off since it was very general material, but the rest of the classes actually had really interesting readings. She normally would have a student do a short presentation on one reading and lead for the rest of class and offer interesting insights in both areas. The class, which focused on the intersection between the media and politics dealt with a lot of current issues such as how social media effects campaigns. I highly recommend it!\nWorkload:\nVery light, the reading isn't bad and normally she'll suggest what to focus on. You need to teach one class and then write a 20-25 page paper.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Knight's class is extremely interesting. She really cares about every student and presents the information in a very clear manner. At the beginning, she makes it clear that the if you are doing the required reading (very manageable, about 40 pages a night for the first half and then almost none the second half) and listening in lectures, you will know what is required for the course. The only complaints people had in this course were generally from those who did not attend lectures and were not able to do well purely off their last-minute studying.\n\nYes, sometimes the lectures could be more engaging, but she actually definitely made an effort to make it more interesting. She had a great TA and both would often include examples, videos, and other multimedia to try and make it less dry.\n\nOverall, definitely a good course. People who came to most lectures did pretty well at the end.\nWorkload:\nVery reasonable, 1-2 chapters of reading per class (~40 pages) first half and almost none second half. 2 papers, a short one (3-5) and long one (7-9). Midterm and final, both of which she makes the highest score in the class a 100% and curves from there.\n"

            "review_content": "\nClearly the worst class in Columbia.. The way the class is instructed is as though we are studying in a Community College. I am quite appalled that Columbia (or Barnard) hired her. She teaches the class by reading off from the slides in verbatim and the way she talks is so monotonous. It is a struggle to go to each class because you know you can be reading the slides at home.\nI am glad that the person below is got an easy A.. For me it is an easy B.. I didnt have know what to study or what was important because everything was just definitions of words. And the questions on the exam were weird like \"What is the most important characteristic for a journalist.\" It is a highly random question. It sounds easy but it is a multiple choice question and the answers are all the same.\nI just feel that we paid good money to be studying from highly intellectual minds in Columbia and Kathleen Knight is not. She is a nice lady to be honest. Her class wasnt hard but I did not enjoy it at all because she made it boring and uninteresting; completely no motivation for any of us to be interested in the class and made an effort at all cause it was such a waste of time.\nYou must be wondering why I stayed till the end, it was because I thought the class would change to deliver \"more meat\" but I was wrong and it stayed dry till the end.\nWorkload:\nlight\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis was one of the least intellectually stimulating classes I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken at Columbia.  Class consists of Professor Knight reading off of PowerPoint slides containing definitions and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153theories\u00e2\u20ac\u009d taken directly from the texts.  (Her propensity for mispronouncing names and vocabulary from her own notes and the news is shocking.)  Toward the end of the semester, she frequently played commercials and news clips, which helped keep the attention of the small percentage of people who were still attending class.  The midterm and final were very easy (think high school multiple choice/true false/short answer style tests) and basically required you to regurgitate definitions and models from the PowerPoints/readings.  I was able to pull off A\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the papers and exams with little to no effort, but the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153easy A\u00e2\u20ac\u009d doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make up for the boredom and frustration inspired by this class.  The media should be an interesting and engaging topic, but Professor Knight manages to reduce it to a list of key terms and a few chapters from a textbook.  (I should point out though that some of the books are good reads on their own terms.)\nWorkload:\nVery light.  Reading was assigned from the 4 books on the syllabus, though I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe most people did it regularly.  I generally skimmed the main book before the exams and received one of the highest grades on the midterm.  The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153news analysis\u00e2\u20ac\u009d paper is pretty straightforward.  The longer paper can be on any topic of your choice related to the media and politic, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to you how research-oriented you want it to be.\n"

Don't even bother, even if it's your favorite subject in the world.\nWorkload:\nA T/F, multiple choice, and short answer-based midterm and final; 1 short news analysis review (5 to 8 pp); 1 longer research essay (10-12 pp).

We also missed about 4 classes due to random family emergencies & health problems.  However, Professor Knight is an extremely nice woman & able professor.  The reading she selects is gernerally good & a welcome departure from the boring theory that most majors are used to.  There was always a great deal of confusion about what to do for exams and papers but everything works out well.  This is a good class for majors who want a break, nonmajors who want to take a polsci class but are afraid it will be too hard as well as people interested in journalism & surprisingly enough people who are interested in advertising & marketing.  \nWorkload:\na ton of reading but it is gernerally interesting (you will have no clue about when to read by so just make sure they are done by the exams)\n1 midterm\n1 final (supposedly cumulative but you can do well just with knowing the stuff from the second half)\n1 short (5-7) page paper analyzing a news story (no research needed)\n1 10-12 page paper about whatever you want as long as it vaguely fits into the topic of the class (as research-oriented as you want it to be)\n"

I also did the reading when it seemed unrequired.  There were some very different opinions amongst the students in the class about topics which sometimes dominated the discussion.  Professor Knight was bothered, obviously, by this.  Each student was required to make one formal presentation on a topic relating to women which took up practically the entire months of October and November - but were interesting, but I would have rather talked more about the reading.\nWorkload:\nheavy ready each week, but not all required in the end - pick and choose what interests, three presentations, one paper (or other medium) on presentation topic (7+pgs), final colloquium paper (20+pgs)\n"

Don't expect too much from her, but if you stick it out I think you'll find you actually learned something.\nWorkload:\nMidterm, news-analysis paper, final, final paper on anything having to do with media and politics. *Her tests are tricky*\n"

Everyone has 2 5-10 minute presentations summarizing a chapter from 2 different readings throughout the semester so you learn a lot regardless.
