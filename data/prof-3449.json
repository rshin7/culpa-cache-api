            "review_content": "\nNoguchi sensei is a good teacher, and did very well teaching Elem. Japanese A this past semester. She is patient when one makes mistakes (which tends to happen quite a bit since Japanese isn't the easiest to learn) and is pretty engaging in class. She is also able to get the class to respond pretty well when participation is required.\nSo overall I would recommend her.\nAs for Japanese itself, the language has a good flow but I'm left wondering who thought it would be a good (*&^ing idea to come up with 3 separate (*&^ing alphabets for the same (*&^ing language. With that said, it is definitely fun to learn.\nWorkload:\nNear daily quizzes and HW, ~5-6 labs, 1 composition/oral presentation, ~2-3 midterms, 1 final.\n"
