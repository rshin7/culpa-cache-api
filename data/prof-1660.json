When the professor attends class (he travels a lot with work), he is very well prepared and delivers well.  The grading is very tough-he believes in a true curve and will lower your grade if the class average is too high.  So, really good class but expect to work hard for your grade...\nWorkload:\nBiweekly problem sets, midterm, take-home final, project\n"
