So called \"class discussions\" don't consist of discussions between the students but consist of his ramblings with a few occasional chances for 1 or 2 students to say a few words. He is really interesting as a person and does weird things like wear ugly christmas sweaters and odd blue hipster glasses. He's very nice and approachable, but needs more experience in teaching and facilitating but not dominating discussion. He is a very easy grader. \nWorkload:\n2 presentations, 3 papers, two 4-6 pages and 1 8-10 pages. \n"
