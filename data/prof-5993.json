            "review_content": "\nDr. Chiarello teaches the third orthopedics course for the physical therapy program (spine). This course is both organized and fascinating with Dr. Chiarello at the helm. She provides additional insight from her extensive research involving pregnant women with diastasis rectus. Her class, though difficult, is evaluated fairly and well worth the effort. The course extensive information of spinal disorders, physical therapy treatment of the disorders, and mechanical hands on practice of physical therapy methods. The only disappointing aspect of the class was the lack of grade 5 manipulation involving the spine. \nWorkload:\nThe work load is fairly heavy, with extensive lecture and lab commitments. \n"
