She's incredibly intelligent, well-read, and kind, but perhaps she's still getting used to the whole \"teaching\" thing. To get on her good side, talk a lot, but don't say anything too radical. She will steer a discussion back on track when it diverges too much from what she wants to cover. The only really bad parts of the class were the 10 response papers and the time she made us come to class on friday .\nWorkload:\n10 (count 'em, 10) one-page response papers in addition to three 4-5 page papers. in-class presentation, mid-term, and final. she'll tell you not to worry about the mid-term and final, and she's right, you shouldn't.\n"
