            "review_content": "\nI can't say enough good things about Professor Rojas!!! I think after teaching the course for so many years, he has it down to a science (no pun intended). He posts an assignment on courseworks each day (so five per week) and holds office hours every single day. The assignments are never due, but if you keep up with them you're good to go for the exams. During the second half of the semester I generally did the assignments every weekend or every other weekend rather than after each class, but it still worked out well. Because Professor Rojas is such a good lecturer that I never felt lost or like I had to teach the concepts to myself, which seems to be pretty rare for intro science classes. I simply showed up to class, did the assignments as much as possible, and learned organic chemistry! I never felt like I was blindly memorizing things or teaching myself from a textbook.\nA tip for the last part of the semester - you should keep a running list of new reactions that you learn and organize them by product. Then, memorize the mechanism and the reagents. Having a consistent study group throughout the semester is also helpful! \nApart from that, Professor Rojas is a really funny guy overall. He reads poetry during class and seems to have a good sense of the pulse of the class (and Barnard in general). If you have to take organic chemistry, you should hands down take it with Rojas. \nWorkload:\n3 midterms and a final. Although it's technically cumulative, the final is heavily focused on material from the last quarter of the class.\n"

I had him for both orgo 1 and orgo 2, and I feel so blessed to have had him for a whole year.  First things first, he knew every single person\u2019s name in a class of around 120 by studying the pictures on the courseworks roster.  He also holds office hours every single day, where you just go through homework questions and he teaches you helpful tips for solving the problems and for studying, so I would DEFINITELY recommend going at least once a week, more around exam times.  There is no textbook for this class, because Rojas writes all of his own problem sets and tests.  The way he writes the test is that if you go through all the notes from lecture and all the assignments, you don\u2019t need to study anything additional, which proved to be true!  Before tests I just made review sheets for each reaction and redid all the assignments and I was fine! I got an A in orgo 1 and haven\u2019t gotten my grade yet for orgo 2 but I did well on the tests and I feel good about the final.  \nPlus, he is SO funny and tells lots of jokes, and also reads poetry and sings on a fairly regular basis, (he wore a turkey-hat on the class before thanksgiving).  \nHe started this video of the week thing during orgo 2, and he basically had videos made of him doing practice problems with the reactions we had just learned.  These were VERY helpful because sometimes when you go over so many reactions in lecture, it can be hard to understand how to do the problems.  \nOverall this class is AMAZING!!!\nWorkload:\nHe posts assignments every night that are anywhere from 2-8 problems, but they aren't graded or collected, so you can do them at your own pace.  He also posts the solutions the next night, so it isnt a big deal if you can't figure out how to do the problems.  Other than that just going over notes and assignments is what you do to study for the test.  Plus the videos.\nDon't be fooled, this class is very challenging and you will work incredibly hard, but Rojas manages to make it SO SO manageable and wants everyone to succeed.\n"

He grades very fairly if not leniently, but office hours are crucial if you want an A. I usually went twice a week. Also--he isn't charmed by suck ups. He doesn't play favorites at all, so don't waste your time with that route. Show up to class. Take notes. Go to office hours. And most importantly--do not be afraid to ask questions. Those are the things that matter to Professor Rojas and those are the things that will get you a great grade. He is an excellent, excellent educator and probably the best I've ever had. Best piece of information about Professor Rojas--he makes his own problem sets, so his tests are extremely related to the homework. If you master the problem sets, you'll do very well on his exams. There are no surprises. \nWorkload:\nnightly problem sets usually consisting of somewhere between 2 and 6 questions--really not a big deal because they take like 20 minutes and if you have a question just ask it in office hours. you don't need to turn them in, they're just for you. try to keep up with them as much as you can, but I've gotten A's on exams when I pushed off the assignments for a few days too (just make sure to catch up with enough time to review the problems 2-3 more times for a couple of days before the test). 4 midterms, very fair and not on so much material. 1 final, big emphasis on later part of the semester. \n"

I was really, really struggling the first half of the semester and I went to him asking if I should withdraw, basically freaking out. He was so nice, and empathetic and urged me not to withdraw because I wasn't at that point. He gave me study tips and urged me to come to office hours at least once a week. I highly recommend that if you take this course you go to office hours MORE than once a week. He holds them every day at different times so you should be able to go to at least one. I went every day. These office hours gave me As on the 3 exams after the first 2. He explains and explains and explains like crazy and will answer anything at all. No question is dumb in this class and he takes every question very seriously and makes sure you understand what you need help on. He is so extremely supportive and helpful. His in class notes are also amazing and color coordinated and organized. I have never had any professor so dedicated and so patient. Orgo sucks but I ended up enjoying it a lot more because of him.  \nRojas also got the Emily Gregory Professor Award at Barnard, well deserved. \nWorkload:\n4 midterms (increasing in weight towards grade) and 1 final. daily practice problems for our own use, never turned in (definitely do these if you want an A). \n"

            "review_content": "\nPut very simply, Professor Rojas is an incredible Professor!  Although I hate organic chemistry, and I have really struggled through this class, Professor Rojas has helped an immense amount.  He not only explains everything in class very throughly (with color-coding, and super clear writing), but he is very open to questions and regularly answers related questions in the middle of lecture.  In addition, he just had a way of making the lecture (dare I say it, entertaining).  He would recite poetry to send us off to the weekend, he showed a video of translation of mRNA with Star Wars music in the background, and he often gave us \"fun facts\" (albeit orgo related) to bring up in intelligent conversation.  I highly recommend this class for anyone who loves the material, or who need to take orgo for a requirement.  Especially if you're debating between Columbia and Barnard.  Take orgo with Rojas...\nOne of his most endearing quotes is:\n\"unicorn+dragon=rhino\"\nIf you want to know why, enroll in orgo with Rojas!\nWorkload:\nThere were daily problem sets (for our own practice), and four midterms and 1 final.  Rojas recommended we dedicate 1 hour a day to orgo.  But be forewarned, if you take orgo lab simultaneously, you'll be hard-pressed to dedicate all of the time you need to orgo lecture (which is what happened to me).  \n"

But Rojas definitely gave off a rock star vibe in lecture.  He did things like recite Scottish poetry.  He has a good sense of humor.\nOn the approachable student-oriented side of things, Rojas explains things so clearly, with neat handwriting and color-coding.  He learned most students' names in a lecture course of over 100.  If you don't understand something, and you ask about it in office hours, he will find a way to make you understand.  His flexibility and skill teaching are truly amazing. \nYou will love him, and you will love orgo.  In order to also love your orgo grades, my advice is go to office hours at least once a week, preferably more.  Also keep up with the assignments.  Spend at least 15 minutes trying to solve a problem on your own before checking a solution.  If you still don't understand a problem after seeing the solution, ask about it at office hours.  The goal is not just to complete the assignments but to fully understand them.\nWorkload:\nRojas recommends an hour per day, six days per week.  I spent maybe an hour and a half per day, five days per week, and came out with an A.  I never found the orgo lecture course very stressful.  If you keep up, it's perfectly manageable.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Rojas is, hands down, the best science teacher I had at Barnard/Columbia for the reasons that every other reviewer has already noted.  Even compared to humanities classes (I was a humanities major), I think this class was extremely well taught and helped you appreciate orgo (somehow).  That said, it's no walk in the park, but what I do appreciate about this class is that the resources he gives you entitles everyone an equal chance to do well.  Here are the rules:\n1.  Attend every lecture and recitation session, no exceptions.  If you miss a lecture (bc of an emergency) get the notes immediately, go over them and make sure you get caught up.\n2.  Do the problem sets before the recitation.  \n3. Go to at least 1 or 2 office hour sessions a week.  He holds one almost everyday, there really is no excuse to not attend.  Also, if you can't make any of them, he'll meet with you on your own.  Don't be intimidated by his cultish followers, who try to hog up all the time asking questions.  Be bold and ask yours too.  \n4. Study for the tests at least 2 weeks ahead in advance.  He tests understanding, not how well you can memorize.  \n5.  Form a study group, with smart, kind-hearted folks.  Although, this is not absolutely necessary, it definitely helps and, if nothing else, when everyone else is partying on the Thursday night before an orgo exam, you don't have to be cooped up all alone and scared in butler.    \n6.  SLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE TESTS - I can't say this enough.  The test requires critical thinking.  You need to be human (not half man half red bull) when you take it.  \nLastly,\n7. Don't get sick.  I know this sounds stupid, but I really mean it.  Take your vitamin C pills, flu shot, cut off coughing friends, etc.  Take care of your body and sleep because getting sick can absolutely hurt your chances of doing well in this class.  \nOk, well that was longer than I intended, but I sincerely hope this info helps you.  And I also think you should consider capping the number of credits you take to 15 during these semesters.  \n\nWorkload:\n1 problem set week (not collected), 2-3 lectures a week, 1 recitation/week, 3 midterms, 1 final\n"

Even I found myself surprised at my final grade, as it was a LOT better than I had expected it to be.  \nI think the only thing that made me stick through with his class was not the fact that he taught it well, but because I really admired his personality.
