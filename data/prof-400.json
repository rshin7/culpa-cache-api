            "review_content": "\nWhat can be said about Prof. Dames that hasn't been said already. He is not just a kind and helpful man, but also extraordinarily knowledgeable and passionate. He is an excellent leader of in-class discussion and seems genuinely eager to hear what others have to say, not a given in English courses. Excellent choice of readings. The only criticism I might offer is that Dames is too nice; this bothered me only when he would rather spin a silly comment into gold rather than shut it down (a la Erik Gray, his close competitor in excellence). But I guess that is just a mater of preference. \nThis class was remarkable--not just for its engagement in close reading, but also for placing short stories in a historical context that was both illuminating and comprehensive.\nWorkload:\nAn extraordinary amount of reading--almost unmanageably so. But if you commit yourself to the class and devote the time, it will be unspeakably rewarding. Two essays--one eight pages and one four--were assigned, along with ungraded discussion board posts for each class. \n"

            "review_content": "\nMan, oh man. Where to start? How about here: Nick Dames will be the best professor you have at Columbia. I suppose it's possible there's someone a little better out there, lurking in a barely occupied seminar about fin-de-si\u00c3\u00a8cle sculpture in the Maldives, but I doubt it. Who else could get away with scheduling a class at 9 a.m. on Fridays\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand have his students be happy with it? I spent a semester's worth of Thursday nights hunched over books and in bed by midnight, and I remember it more fondly than anything else I've done here.\nDames has, as you may have guessed, every skill one needs to be an excellent scholar. He speaks a million languages: German, Latin, French, and Greek all popped up during our sessions. He has read seemingly every book ever, prose or poetry, fiction or nonfiction, English or otherwise. He reads with awe-inspiring care, dwelling on asides and word choices in addition to themes and metaphors and symbols. But there are plenty of excellent scholars around this place. It's Columbia, for crissakes. \nDames distinguishes himself from everyone else here through his immense classroom gifts. No one can lead a discussion like he can. It's not that he's great at coaxing participation out of his students\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe isn't; he's actually a fairly reserved guy. What he can do is take the most threadbare comment from the dimmest or least attentive person in the room and make it sound like it came from the mind of Jacques Barzun himself. \"Yeah,\" Dames'll nod and say, after someone rambles on for 45 seconds of nothing, \"That raises this question: [Something totally brilliant and very loosely related that Dames has thought up].\" The original speaker goes along with it, because now Dames has convinced her that she's brilliant. It's a positive and fascinating way to lead a seminar. Dames also starts every class with a relevant quotation from some other text, and later in the session he'll introduce a handout with some related-but-not-too-related primary source material. I have all of them in my notes, and I still refer to them months down the road.\nI liked most all of the books in this class--Mansfield Park, The Egoist, The Age of Innocence, The Portrait of a Lady, The Line of Beauty, A Handful of Dust--despite no prior interest in the material. I know that some of my classmates didn't feel the same way, but hell, we'd take a Dames seminar even if the syllabus called for exegesis of the phone book. He's that good.\nWorkload:\n200ish pages of reading per week, weekly CourseWorks postings (informal), 12-15 page final paper with prospectus due beforehand. \n"

There were only 4 novels on the syllabus, but each was carefully chosen, and Dames links them well in his lectures (\"We'll see this theme treated differently in Little Dorrit\" for example), so the class flows seamlessly.\nBut what made this class so phenom. was the professor's willingness and ability to reference other historical and social movements of the time.  What other English professor would hand out a selection from Maxwell's physics texts, or photocopy a dictionary of slang?  These aren't gimmicks but very carefully woven into the fabric of his lectures.  You come away from class thinking about these novels in a completely different and interdisciplinary way.\nHe's also incredibly approachable after class and in office hours. I wish I had gone to his OH more frequently!\nWorkload:\nNovels are long (about 700 pages each) but the pace is slow (about 1 novel a month).  Undergrads have a weekly discussion section and two short essays + a final.  Grad students have one longer (~15 page) essay at the end of the semester.\n"

I would not be surprised if he could submit his lecture notes directly for publication as articles. \nBeyond the sheer intellectual engagement and interest of his observations, however, he is also very well organized. I particularly like how he writes a relevant quote on the board for each lecture--often from Benjamin, Marx, Weber, and the like. He also provides a rough outline of each lecture in advance, so it is easy to take notes in a coherent manner. \nThis was a wonderful course, and I really enjoyed doing the reading. I particularly loved the paper topics; the creative options and more traditional options were both really engaging, and I would have been happy to use any of the prompts. The book selections were also wonderful. I'm glad we read The Book of Snobs in addition to the longer works. \nAs a whole, the course seemed really well-paced, and I'm really glad I took it. If you've always wanted to tackle some of the longer Victorian novels and never gotten around to it, this is a great environment to read them in!\nWorkload:\nFair--the readings were substantial but spaced out, and the paper topics were all really interesting. \n4 longer novels, one shorter excerpt from Thackeray, 2 6-8 page papers (although they can be parodies of the author's style), and a take-home final\n"

Some people seemed to eat it up.  I didn't.  I was hoping he could shed some light on why these books are important, why they are still read, and what we can gain from them.  Instead, I sat through lectures on subjects as varied as suicides in 19th century Europe and Phrenology.  I want my time back.\nWorkload:\nNot difficult.

I've taken his Dickens class the semester before, and now I've taken his 19th Century Victorian novel class. The great thing about both classes is that:\n1. His insights into the books are simply astounding. He'll draw parallels between psychology, sociology, history and the novel. It's not like some professors where they force an interpretation upon the text, but he does it so well that they fits hand in glove.\nAlso, every lecture is masterclass. It's never trite, or expected. Expect to be surprised. \n2. He's incredibly friendly and approachable. He's not like some of those haughty professors where talking to them is a daunting experience. He's really helpful in his comments on your essays. \n3. The books he uses for both classes don't overlap. It's great. I love Victorian fiction, and this arrangement just made my love for British literature a lot more passionate.\nAll in all, having professor Dames as your lecturer is everything which defines Columbia. It's such a pity we don't have more of his like in this school\nWorkload:\nManageable. It's really what you want to get out of this class.

I'm not even taking his class this semester, and I'm going to be going to as many lectures as possible.  Man, I sound obsessed.  I am.  \nGo to his office hours, seriously DO IT.  I'm considering writing my senior thesis on a topic he introduced to me in office hours.  I am a huge, huge procrastinator, but I began my essays for this class on the day they were assigned.  They were the best essays that I have written at Columbia (or anywhere else).  This extreme behavioral shift was due to the fact that I was, simply, inspired rise to Dames' level (impossible, maybe) of insight.  \nJust randomly - for Dickens and many other authors that Dames generally covers, there are online texts for which it is possible to search key terms, character names, and catch phrases.  I found this tool helpful...\nAnd, to conclude:  For the first time in my life, I feel alive!  That is, reading, thinking about, analyzing, and loving texts.  Listen to The Man, write down everything He says, and go forth and learn.  \nWorkload:\nModerate-heavy reading, two 5-page papers and 1 final.\n"

If you read the books (which are really good, and if you're a non-English major like me, a welcome break from what you're usually reading), you'll be awed by his interpretation of the material; and even if you don't, you can get enough out of the lectures to be fully prepared for every paper and final.

I took this class spring 2003. It was a lecture with around 60 students and it was such a blast that the english dept is offering the same exact class with Dames at the reigns this semester (fall 2004) even though it's only supposed to be a fall class. That says something about his teaching. It was the first english class that I took at Columbia. Just for some background I'm a math major who enjoys a good novel. Even though the class was listed as a four-thousand level class, no prereqs are required. ONLY a voracity for reading is needing, and the shite is good stuff anyway. (I took it cuz I saw that Dostoevsky and Dickens were being taught in the same class.) The reading list is awesome. But the most amazing part of the class is how effortlessly he talks about the material. He stands up there at the podium and just chats with you. You don't even have to take notes. The topics that he covers are seemingly random. When we were doing Goethe, he would talk about the landscaping described in _Elective Affinities_, when we did Stendhal he talked about post Napoleon Europe and the psyche of the European people. In Dickens we learned about the commercialized press. In the end what I learned is that Dames tries not to dwell too much on the specifics of the books. He tries to persuade you that writing is and forever will be a photograph of the time and place in which the author lived and should always be approached that way. There aren't any reading quizzes. You'll do the reading because the class is so ef-ing cool.\nP.S. I asked him to reccomend other professors in the department out of curiousity. (He's focus is on 19th century novels btw.) He reccommended Bruce Robbins and Sarah Cole, both of whom work with modern fiction. But I'm guessing they must be awesometastic as well. He didn't reccomend any professors who work on theatre, Shakespeare, or poetry though which was interesting.\nWorkload:\ntwo papers (6 pages each), he's lax about deadlines!! but don't abuse!! TAKE HOME FINAL!!!! the final is not a paper. It's six PARAGRAPHS of writing on six different novels, each paragraph focusing specifically on a particular literary device in the book being written about. e.g. paragraph one would be on the style apparent in _The Red and the Black_ and paragraph two would be on the characterization in _Fathers and Sons_ etc. \n"

            "review_content": "\nAwful, awful, awful!  What were the people who wrote these previous reviews thinking? Psych!!! He is definitely one of the best professors at Columbia. Prof. Dames is extremely nice and really wants to get to know everyone. The classes are painless because he mixes short insightful, yet still informal, lectures with animated class discussion. He leads the discussions, but does not overwhelm them, giving students plenty of time to talk. His informal teaching style and humble nature immediately sets the class at ease. Plus, you literally cannot look stupid in this class because he can take the most ridiculous things and turn them into really intelligent comments. He seems to know everything about everything. I'm not sure if he researches his lectures extremely thoroughly or if he just knows all sorts of tidbits about every little detail that could possibly come up, but either way, he tends to blow the class away with his knowledge base. He knows classic Greek, which comes in handy pretty much the entire first semester, but his specialty is British Literature, aka \"the novel\" of 19th century.  I really can't think of a bad thing to say about him. One of the other reviews said that the paper topics were a little narrow, but you can come up with your own topic as long as you clear it with him first. A+ professor. Give him tenure!!!!\nWorkload:\nBasic lit. hum. workload. Lots of reading. 3 short papers the first semester, 2 slightly longer papers the second semester. 1 midterm and 1 final each semester. Not as easy as the other reviewers seem to think. Although he is reluctant to give bad grades, he doesn't hand out As left and right. Basically, it is easy to fall into the B-range, but you actually have to work to get an A. But when grading, he tends to value the big picture more than perfect proof reading (I spelled Aeschylus incorrectly a million times in one of my papers and it did not affect my grade).\n"

            "review_content": "\nI ran out of time and superlatives filling out a end-of-course evaluation for Professor Dames.  There's really no end to the good things I can say about him.  His lecturing style is gripping, understated, and simultaneously reverent and irreverent; one gets the sense that he genuinely adores these books enough to make gentle fun of them, as one would a good friend.  As for the content of his lectures\u00c2\u2014well, at their worst, they're intriguingly insightful and original, and at their best they're nothing short of miraculous.  He'll introduce each lecture with a theme or theory, expound on it briefly, and then venture off on any number of topics, leaving you fascinated but wondering how it all fits together.  Never fear: towards the end of class, in a few brilliant moves, he'll weave together all his various loose threads and then spend the remaining time (to change the metaphor) riffing like a virtuoso on his new revelations, leaving you elated, enlightened, and slightly breathless.  Plus he's welcoming and helpful during office hours, immensely forgiving, humble, and just plain nice.  The novels on the syllabus are, for the most part, more than worthwhile.  Do watch out for the Flaubert, which is dreadful\u00c2\u2014except his lectures on it are marvelous, as usual, and one them effectively and quite entertainingly explained to me WHY I thought it was dreadful, thereby proving to me once and for all that Nicholas Dames is nothing short of priceless.  I recommend him wholeheartedly. \nWorkload:\nEight leisurely-spaced novels, none of which, with the exception of the utterly ridiculous _Our Mutual Friend_, is too unmanageably long.  Two 5-7 page essays and a take-home final.  If I have one criticism (and it's a tiny one), it's that the paper topics are too closely related to his interests: it was hard for me to write something worthwhile on the topics when he'd already said everything a hundred times better than I ever could.  But that's my failing, not his.  I love this man.\n"

He balances refined, cerebral lectures with an adroit maneuvering of class discussion and an approachable disposition. When grading papers, he always give students the benefit of the doubt, seemingly reluctant to give B's. He manages to breath life into even the stalest of pieces of Victorian Lit. by exploring issues of genre and social context. I don't think he'll be teaching any more undergrad classes until the 2002-2003 school year, but definitely take one of his classes if you have the chance. Everyone I know who's had him agrees that he's a real gem. In fact, as a professor, he really doesn't have any significant weak spots; I've taken MANY English classes, and I give Prof. Dames higher all-around marks than anyone else.\nWorkload:\nThe reading load can get a little intense for the Brit Lit class, and Lit Hum is Lit Hum. Lit Hum: two 5-8 pagers, a midterm, and a final. Brit Lit: one 4-6 pager, one 8-10 pager, and a final.\n"

Totally devoted to his classes, has an amazing command of British literature. Bring up Austen and watch him go...his lectures are articulate and complex enough to be studied in a class of their own, but he's more than open to comment, dissent, or questions...will explain the dirtiest pun in the Lysistrata or the sociological implications of Jude the Obscure with equal adroitness. I've had a class with him every semester since I got here; don't know what I'll do when I run out of options!\nWorkload:\nBritish novels are long. Brace yourself.\n"

He is a master of British literature and is passionate about it, and best of all, he inspires students to feel the same. The only downsides are: his grading is a bit uneven and students might find it unfair that he usually criticizes what he feels is missing in a paper, rather than grading for what is there. Your grade will always improve if you see him or a TA before a paper is due. For non-English majors, I'd recommend taking the class pass-fail, just to enjoy his lectures.\nWorkload:\nTwo papers, take home final. Books are quite weighty, but mostly enjoyable. You can get away with skipping one or two. But then you'd miss out on his brilliant lectures.\n"
