The best part about Jason is that he is rational and understands that you have other classes and possibly work, and maybe even extra curricular activities such as internships that extend demand upon you outside of the world of his classroom. Totally realistic in what he expects of you and makes it absolutely clear what those expectations are. If you attend class and do the assignment as he instructs, you will have no problem doing well. I'm not saying he is the easiest professor; in fact, he commands a lot in the way of quality from his students, but he is also incredibly accessible and willing to help you meet your goals in the class and end up where you want to be grade wise.\nWorkload:\nApprox. as I don't have the syllabus in front of me...\n1st Semester: 6 courseworks postings, 5 papers, Take-home Midterm, Final. 2nd Semester: 3 courseworks postings, 3 Papers, 1 group presentation, Take-home Midterm, Final.\n"
