She is funny and has fun stories to tell in class (of course its in German). She asks us to tell her how we feel and what we did over our breaks/weekends. It is hard not to enjoy the class.\nWorkload:\nDepends on how much you know the language...many quizes/many homeworks... no midterm....and a final\n"
