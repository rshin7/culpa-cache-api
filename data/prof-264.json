He's an expert on crime. And he is super adorable. \nYou get out what you put in to the program--Piccato gives you the hilarious minutia that is 20th century Mexican history, and you string together the tragic themes.It was a great class. Chock full of information, but never trying. Highly recommend. \nWorkload:\n The readings are helpful but not terribly vital to your performance. Outside assignments give you the opportunity to engage with film and literature. They're light and designed to be flexible. We also went on an optional (and well worth-it) field trip to an exhibit on crime journalism. \n"

In fact, there is almost no structure...Mexico history is fascinating, but the assigned readings were irrelevant (the only helpful reading was the supplementary bethell book which you should buy even though its no required if you want to pass the class), section was annoying and did not spark interesting discussion. every now and then, pablo will have very interesting lectures, but the power points were totally unorganized. how can you teach history esp mexican history through powerpoint and graphs that are too small to comprehend! \nstill, pablo is a nice man and is very helpful outside of class if you need a scholar on mexican history-he is definitely approachable, its just too bad his class isn't more engaging. if you want a dry history lecture, go for this class, just be ready to bring your lap top and play solitare. \n\nWorkload:\nnot connected to the class so you do it all on your own and without any guidance. included two papers, midterm, final, and weekly reports on irrelevant readings. oh yes, and section where participation counts for 20% of your grade. hah. \n"

            "review_content": "\nLook, there's only one thing you need to know about this course before opting to take something else. It is irrelevant whether or not you hope to find the material interesting, whether you think (and I can't imagine why anyone would, but judging from previous reviewers....) that Pablo is hopelessly adorable, or whether you are just shopping for a Major Cultures req that fits your schedule (big mistake....BIG mistake). \nThe fact is - THERE IS NO WAY TO ACCESS THE COURSE MATERIAL aside from going to class. I'll just let that sit with you for a moment.\nOkay, so the solution to the problem isn't as easy as it seems. You're probably thinking - \"That's not such a big deal. I'll just go to class, no problem.\" No. You can go to class all you like, the likelihood that you will not understand a WORD Piccato says is far greater than the likelihood that you will make it to every lecture. I attended every class and I can't even recall for you a single thing we discussed. I'm not sure if things have changed since I took this course in Spring 2002, but as far as I'm aware, Piccato doesn't even go as far as to make availabe to students an outline or anything resembling an outline. Nothing with names or spellings of Spanish or Portuguese words. You can amuse yourself by guessing as to what these may be, as you will surely need to find things to do to amuse yourself to keep from passing out from utter boredom. I chose to focus in great detail on my penmanship, as Piccato will zip so quickly through facts that, were I to understand him, or have a clue what he was talking about, I could never keep up with him for the purposes of notetaking. \nThis is particularly difficult because, as I said - THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO ACCESS THE COURSE MATERIAL - comprende? No text, no lecture notes, no outlines, no required reading that is even tangentially related to the course material. You are left without the option of referring back to notes for clarity, (because you will never succeed in taking notes), nor can you refer to any relevant text-like resource. (If you happen to have a keen enough ear to understand the words that come out of Piccato's mouth, I hope you also have a POWERFUL memory because the only way to review concepts or study for the exam is to sit for a few hours and see if you can't remember everything ever said in class. Another technique, which I implemented, was to write down random words and use those as a guideline for the exercise in memory, the sole study option.) There are suggested readings from something like 13 books which, if you are looking for a new and innovative way of buring several hundred dollars in less time than in would take to actually set fire to your credit card, you might consider doing. Or you have the option of being the only person at the Butler reserves, poring over absurd amounts of \"suggested\" reading that will never resurface in class, on papers, or in an exam. \nYou may sit through class wondering how you'll ever succeed in coming up with supporting information for your two papers, which are based on outside readings, if you have no idea what goes on in class. I am here to tell you not to worry. Not only are the readings irrelevant, they are downright strange. One of the books was about a slave revolution in Brazil, and that was alright, but the other was Kiss of the Spider Woman - which is heavy on the homoeroticism, but light on, uh, HISTORY. \n\n"

The material is interesting, although it often seems super general and super basic,  but Pablo is just not an interesting lecturer.  He is indeed adorable and very approachable, but not interesting.  I think that if I weren't interested in the subject in the first place, I'd find this class a nightmare.  Covering 200 years of history about a continent and a half is simply impossible, and it showed.  It seemed like the most important things I'd heard of before and hoped to actually learn in this class were left out.  I was shocked when Piccato never mentioned the names Salvador Allende (who magically appeared on the final exam for the first time!) or Augusto Pinochet.  He did go on at length about how sugar cane is processed into consumable sugar in Brazil, the significance of baseball in 1960s Cuba, and the extent of prostitution in Mexican cities.  These are admittedly important topics, but that doesn't mean he should have excluded other obviously important info to go on about that.  But I digress...Very important: make sure you go to lecture--there's no other way to pass this class, since the readings are basically supplementary.  His lectures did not come from anything we read for the response papers. \nWorkload:\nOverall, this is a good List A (although I've heard of better ones)...not too much reading, a few response papers (annoying but the TA basically admitted that as long as you write something and it meets the length requirement, its good enough), midterm and final--both easy as long as you study a bit and write down as much as you know, 2 papers that I must admit were graded arbitrarily.\n"

The readings are manageable, if unnecessary.  TAs grade everything both strictly and arbitrarily.  Plus, pretty much any problem in Latin America over the last two centuries was blamed exclusively on America, with contrary opinions  being shot down in the discussion sections (both by the TA and by fellow students).

The material is fairly interesting, but Piccato presents it in the MOST UNINTERESTING manner possible.  You discuss the same aspects for every country and you have trouble while studying trying to keep each country straight.

He is a good lecturer who is able to present the overall historical picture. However, the TA's are terrible (this broad class should definetely have a weekly recitation) and the readings (what few we had) are not enough to fill in the blanks that his survey course lectures leave gapping. Should you take the course? Yes--if you are interested in the subject.... Piccato's class could be super if he had more readings, particularly a course text book or general history, weekly discussion sections, and if he used more cool lecture add-ons like music and pictures. On second thougt, skip this course, quickly brief yourself in modern latin America through Skidmore's classic survey, and take a Piccato seminar!\nWorkload:\nSuper light, not so fluffy.

I'll conceed that he is not the most animated lecturer, but he got better as the semester went along (even cracked a few jokes). He is extremely thematic in his lectures, which helps because you can ignore dates and picky details (they won't be on the tests) and focus on the big picture. I'll be honest and say that this is a pretty outstanding way to get through the major cultures requirement, consisting of both low work and low expectations (I could tell on the first day of class that it had a good reputation based on the number of overgrown jocks that had decided to take the class together). All and all go for it. If you can string together a decent CC paper you will get both an A in this class, as well as a general understanding of Latin American Civilization.

Very disorganized, monotone, and (given his accent) tough to understand lectures, throws out information haphazardly.. you're lucky TA's are grading exams and papers, because they have no clue what he's talking about either, half the time.

So many professors (I think it's a U.S.A. thing) are afraid to acknowledge class antagonisms; he's not. The class is stronger for it. The readings Piccato chooses are almost always great. No Mickey Mouse history here; rather, a lot of strong social analysis... a lot of the readings are labor-centric. Also, I should add that Picatto is a very approachable man. I would reccommend this course to anyone; It satisfies a Major Cultures credit if you want. You can take part one, which is Latin Am Civ up to 1810 as well -- I didn't, but it's also supposed to be a good class. There are people who hate the class because of Prof. Piccato's delivery style.
