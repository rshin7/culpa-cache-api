            "review_content": "\nThis past semester, Glen Hocky ran what was without a doubt the worst recitation I have ever attended. The fifty minute long recitation was supposed to consist of 35 minutes of instruction and a 15 minute weekly quiz. Glen would usually start ten minutes late and then hand out the quizzes with 5-10 minutes left of class, making me habitually late to my next class. The resulting 30 or so minutes of instruction time usually consisted of him confusedly doing 1-3 homework problems on the board excruciatingly slowly and without much coherent explanation. The quiz medians were usually between 40% and 70%, further showing how even after a review session with Glen covering the same topics as the quiz, nobody really learned anything about chemistry.\nWorkload:\nWeekly 3-question, 15 minute quizzes covering the lectures from the preceding week. No quizzes in the same weeks as midterms. Lowest 2 quiz grades dropped.\n"
