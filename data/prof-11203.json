Fortunately he was far too nice to pull it off and ended up being one of most likable TAs I've ever had. His section was always entertaining and I always understood the material very well by the end of the section (which would not have been the case with just the lectures). You'l still have to work ridiculously hard to get a good grade in this course but at least you won't have to teach yourself much and you'll know about a number of Mowshowitz's tricks before you encounter them on the exam. I highly recommend his section.\nWorkload:\nReally easy quizes buy you'll learn a lot from them.\n"
