            "review_content": "\nI am prepared for a lot of disagrees on this. Gateway WAS NOT THAT BAD. In fact, I could go so far as to say that I liked Gateway. I do agree that this positive turn of events was almost entirely due to the fact that I had a good group. Yeah sure, we had a couple members of our group that didn't do their share, but really Gateway was way less painful that most people make it out to be. Honestly, you can make as much or as little of it as you want. You can go through Gateway bitching about how dumb it is, or you can suck it up and just do the BS. Yes, I agree that Gateway is BS, but at some level that's how the world is. Binding our reports and making them look \"professional\" may sound useless, but there is something to be said for making kids go through the motions of doing it.\nThis year, we were given the option of making a prototype. But the people so-called \"running\" gateway have no sense of communication. Thus, although at first it was required to build a prototype, they never told the mech-e lab that suddenly 200 students were going to need to use the tools and instead it was made \"optional\". \nThe Design Fundamentals Exam was stupid. The questions were either ambiguous or idiotic (Teamwork starts with who? A. your group B. your team leader C. your friends D. you E. all of the above). The modeling exam was fine, as long as you actually understood the basics behind modeling and don't just follow the videos blindly. \nThe modeling assignments were pretty useless (read: engineers don't use Maya), but fun. You don't have to listen to Jose, however. Only a small component of what he says during the modeling lecture doesn't show up on the video. Go ahead and sleep. You will not be the only one, and Jose doesn't care.\nThat is actually one thing that I appreciated about Gateway. All the instructors understood the college dynamic. The two midterm presentations were due at 1AM and the final was due at 6AM, and trust me, a lot of groups needed that time. The part I don't appreciate is that they are withholding our final grades under the excuse that we have to get them at a \"normal\" time in comparison to our other classes. \nOh and, I never saw McGourty in class. Not once. Not even for the final presentation. \nWorkload:\nA lot. But not as painful as you might think. Make sure you budget your time. The presentations are best done over a couple weekends, not the last one. But as long as you put the work in, you should get a good grade. Our presentations scored over 95 every time. \n"

            "review_content": "\nGateway Lab is a required course for all first-year students in SEAS. Unfortunately, although the actual concept of exposing students to real community partners and having them participate in real projects is a good one, the overall execution of the class is rather poor. This is mostly due to the core components that the course is composed of. Your grade in the course depends on many factors that are beyond your own control and are based on pure luck.\nThese factors are: (1) Your group members (2) The project you are assigned (3) Your advisor\n(1)If you are in a decent group with hard-working members, then you should do pretty well on the group component of the class, which is worth 55% of your grade. If you have bad teammates, well, there's a good chance that they won't put effort into their parts of the assignments, you might submit things late, and your whole team suffers.\n(2) Even if you have a good team, though, you might still have a tough time if you have a terrible project. A terrible project could be something totally useless or an extremely complex one. However, a good team should be able to make some BS up and still do well on the assignments.\n(3) Your group advisor is the one who grades all of your team's assignments. If you're lucky your group will have an easy-grading advisor who is not picky at all and hands out high grades like nothing. But, there's a chance you can get an advisor who just likes to take off points for the smallest things even though the rest of the assignment is great. The small amount of points you lose each time will add up in the end.\nAs for Jack, he's a very interesting man. When he's giving lectures, he gives off a strong vibe that yells \"pretentious\". People seem to abhor him, but it doesn't really matter, considering he's not present 80% of the time and he determines no part of your grade. Be more worried about who your advisor is.\nJose gives all the modeling lectures. There's 7 modeling assignments worth 20 points each, and a modeling midterm worth 100 points, totaling to 24% of your grade. The modeling lectures are often fast-paced, so you should try and pay attention if you're not naturally skilled at modeling programs. In later assignments, you will not receive instructions, and are basically left on your own to figure out how to do them. There will always be people that understand everything, so if you're not one of them, just hope you have some nice classmates willing to help you.  Jose is decent; the only part of the modeling I disliked was when there was parts of assignments that were not even covered in class that he expected us to do. For the most part, though, this aspect of the class is manageable. The modeling midterm is pretty fair and tests you on the basic skills you've learned in the lectures.\nThe newest addition to Gateway this year was the Design Fundamentals Midterm, worth 100 points, which was based on the Dieter book and the Team Developer books that nobody ever read. This test is in no way an indicator of how good of an engineer you are, but rather how well you memorize silly things like the \"Four C's of Design\" and the \"Four Stages of Team Development.\" If you can memorize things easily, you should do pretty well on the test. There's no way of BSing your way through it, either. If you don't know your stuff, you'll probably end up with a 50 or worse.\nThe last 110 points are basically free points that everybody should get. Don't be an idiot and not do one of the weekly reflections, or not go to the required amount of Friday sessions. \nThese are the only points in the whole class that you're guaranteed, so take advantage of them.\nThe last part I forgot to mention, but is widely known, is that there is no curve in this class. So don't be happy if all your classmates are doing crappily, because then you'll all just get bad grades together. If you get 929/1000, you still get an A-. Tough luck, as they say. \nIf you're lucky, you'll escape the class with a good grade. Good luck!\n\nWorkload:\nManageable. Not as bad as they say. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThe best way to approach Gateway is to think of it as a lottery. Why Columbia would choose to make a lottery the centerpiece of its engineering curriculum is a fascinating question, and the less you think about it the happier you will be. But here's the deal:\nADVISERS: This part of the lottery would actually be fun if on the first day of class, a scantily-clad Jose Sanchez picked each group's advisers, raffle-style, out of a rotating drum. Unfortunately, they are assigned in advance. None of the advisers gives a shit about your project, but this apathy manifests itself one of two ways:\n1. Your adviser doesn't care about the class, so he rubber-stamps all your design journals 30/30 and doesn't bother offering constructive criticism.\n2. Your adviser doesn't care about the class, so he has no qualms about taking five points off for every misplaced apostrophe without bothering to offer any constructive criticism.\nThis is the person that determines 50% of your grade. Nothing you do will change his opinion of your project.\nGROUP: Probably the most important part. It is very nearly a law of nature that in any Gateway group, two students will be incapable of reading English and two students (usually not the same) will be incapable of writing it. (Not, by the way, a complaint about the number of international students in SEAS, most of whom received better writing instruction than we blue-blooded Americans). This is not itself a problem as long as people are willing to work, but be prepared to spend more time copy-editing than you do designing. Thankfully...\nDESIGN: Your design does not matter. It will never be built. Nobody will ever use it. If this class were about designing new things nobody would ever be asked to create things like backpacks and tables for which perfectly good commercial solutions exist. Accordingly, the first question on your mind throughout the design process should never be \"does this design meet the customer's needs?\", but rather \"can I make this look good in Maya?\". A few really killer renderings can salvage the most hopeless of presentations.\nI'm not entirely sure why I attached Jose and Jack to this review; the truth is that there is absolutely no instruction in this course. Granted, Jack has been known to give an occasional lecture (in a dynamic, task-oriented, synergistic fashion), but these are entirely devoid of content. Your time during the modeling lectures is better spent just following the printed instruction than attempting to decipher Jose's arcane mumblings about fourth-order Bezier curves and fuselage design.\nSince you won't need all the time in lecture to do the modeling assignments, it's worth spending a little while just playing around in Maya. This, more than anything else, will help you prepare for the modeling exam and for your final report.\nJust remember -- this school has a good engineering program but some unfortunate requirements. It only gets better from here.\nWorkload:\nRanges from nonexistent to soul-destroying, depending on the day of the week, phase of the moon and your housing lottery number.\n"

My company employees about 25,000 design engineers in the US and you would certainly would recognize the name.   \nMy duties include making hiring decisions for new engineers working in research and development positions.  \nPrior to recruiting from a college I often scan the internet to learn about the school and the hot topics I can use during interviews.   This year it happens that my oldest child is interested in Columbia so I have increased my awareness of the school.  \nOn rare occasions I interview Columbia graduates for engineering positions.  Some candidates have included portfolios of research and class work that includes artifacts done in Dr. McGourty's Gateway class. These portfolio's always have an enormous impact on me as an interviewer.  It is common for an applicant to show me brilliant work done by a research team on which they participated.   Honestly I am not impressed.   What catches my eye is evidence of communication, leadership, and project management skills:  can you capture requirements? once you have requirements can you hold a baseline?  can you describe a detailed schedule?  can you accurately report status? how do tasks get split up within a team? \nThe presentations, reports, frustrating customer interviews, and endless stream of non-value-added work artifacts IS an accurate picture of engineering.    Most engineers create FAR more schedules than drawings and more powerpoint slides than source code.   Many projects fail to complete in the time allotted.  \nThe students seem to agree that Dr McGourty is using the class as a pulpit.  Whatever...  The opportunity for learning he is presenting is real.  Sadly most of the freshman students are just not mature enough as leaders to grab that opportunity.  \nSo ... if the student council (and economic conditions) see fit to re-launch the Engineering Job Fair next year I hope you will have a clearer perspective on the Gateway class than I see presented in these reviews.   If you and I meet in Barton Hall and start to discuss intern positions it is likely to come up.  \nWorkload:\nExtremely high for lead.

Most projects are never completed and the school sure as hell won't pay for them. The class is mostly based on thinking up a solution and providing egregious amounts of documentation to demonstrate that something was accomplished. \nDon't buy the Gospel of McGourty. The primary objective of this class is not to teach students engineering and to help the community. It's there to inflate the Engineering school's reputation and McGourty's as well. Don't you see the website and admissions counselors parading the class as the pinnacle of engineering education? It's not. \nGateway is a class about how to write and how to sell stupid ideas. I have no idea how Gateway got National Science Foundation funding, but I'm sure the master of BS knows how to spin the class: \"I mean look at all the documentation showing that the students learned something and the clients gained something. Right?\" This class is a massive waste of time. \nDisclaimer: The rest of this is a rant. \nIf you're primary facilitator, I would recommend a bottle of whiskey in order to dull the pain of the endless drudgery and BS. By the way, I don't buy that \"Primary Facilitator\" bull. You will be the Project Leader. You will take the bulk of the work, but on the plus side, you have no authority to do anything except call and e-mail endlessly. Let's face it, calling these Project Leaders \"Primary Facilitator\" is an Orwellian attempt similar to calling fascist dictators \"Benevolent Caretakers.\" There is no facilitating, and I wish that I had the power to put the fear of God into some of my group members.\nAs a plus, if you work at Investment Banks, you'll be doing similar work: endless BS in order to sell people stupid ideas. At least there, you will be a Master of the Universe and a whiz at Excel. In Gateway, you are the Master of Misery and a whiz at doing slave work. \nWorkload:\nMean - 2 hours.

If you're just taking this course with the attitude: to put in the minimum effort to get an A, like you do in your other class, you won't do well. The key is to take your mind off those numbers in your grade book and focus on your client and the project. You are given a unique opportunity to serve the community with your creative and sharp minds-- that's what engineers do. Once these are all set, you will do fine as long as you communicate. Communicate with the TA's, your teammates, and Jack. \nDo well on the modeling exam to give yourself an edge in the process. And remember that those projects you got are REAL and so as the clients.

Again, to look back on my experience, I would suggest you to become the primary facilitator because you will get the most out of it.

Not to mention the design journals, which teach you the ever-valuable skill of artful BS.

I am so serious. I can't speak to the people who hate McGourty and I can't speak to the people who are upset about their grade, but this class is NOT pointless. It completely encompasses the idea of what it means to be an engineer. All I learned from Gateway was some project management skills and how to draw some cool models. BUT THATS ALL ENGINEERING REALLY IS. Yea sure it takes a crapload of science and math too, but when you're out there in the real world as an engineer, you spend half your day sitting in meetings, struggling to cooperate with a group of nerds, and preparing presentations to show your boss what you've designed so far. In fact the more project managing you're doing at work, the better your salary probably is. \nMaybe this is something that most first years won't realize for a while... but this summer I did a construction internship and seriously... Gateway REALLY prepared me for it. It was like getting paid to retake Gateway pass/fail. Fun!! So regardless of whether or not you like the professor or you're lazy and can't handle the work, this class is the most useful thing in your engineering curriculum, because when you're 45 you can use a computer to do all the math and science for you but you will have to do reports and meetings every week and draw things in AutoCAD. \nIf you hated Gateway, get used to it...... welcome to the rest of your life.\nWorkload:\nHuge.

            "review_content": "\nThe class itself is really not bad at all if you get lucky with a good group and a good project.  I was lucky enough to get both.  Only a few nights did we really have to put work into the class, and it's more fun than doing a pset at least.  The textbook for the class is useless: don't buy it.  You should skim it for the quizzes, but you can instead borrow the textbook from the Yale library (and others) with BorrowDirect.  To be honest, I managed to get perfect scores on all of them without reading many of the assigned chapters.  Towards the middle of the semester the profs stop caring completely and basically everyone just talks about the answers and writes them down.  Jack does a few boring lectures in the first few weeks but then decides he doesn't want to talk anymore and doesn't lecture at all which is good for everyone! Maya is a totally sweet program and you'll have fun learning it.  Matlab is taught in kind of a high-level manner, (not from the bottom up like you'll do in a Compsci class) however since it's taught with COMPUTERS you might even retain something.\nMy main complaint with Gateway is this: my group had a wonderful project and we built a beautiful prototype that really did solve the given problem.  Jack and the TAs and the Community Partner all loved it, but despite that nobody in our group got an A! We went above and beyond to do a damn prototype and still no A.  One member of my group was just 3 points short of an A--out of 1,000 points, he was just 3 points shy of an A and Jack didn't bump him up.  Everyone else in my group had a similar situation.  I think I was 7 points off or so.  In any case, going above and beyond will not get you rewarded, so I recommend just taking this course lightly and doing the bare minimum.  It seems like you don't even have to pretend to like what you're doing anymore; we liked what we were doing and enjoyed the project, and still weren't given an A.  We were bummed to say the least.  If you're lucky and get an A, enjoy the GPA boost.  This class is three hours to screw around once a week--it could be a LOT worse, but this is coming from somebody who had a really great group.  If you get a bad group, you will have a horrid time in this course.  Best of luck to you.\nWorkload:\nYou and your team can make it a joke if you try.  Requirements change every semester but here's what it was like for us: weekly quizzes from material in the Dieter textbook, Weekly Design journals (~3 pgs single spaced) which amongst a group is really minimal work and the subject matter is mindless, One difficult Matlab Assignment (find some friends who know Matlab), One Matlab Midterm (actually pretty tough--Mean was a 65, NO CURVE--this was where most people lost their A's!), a Midterm Project Report (basically just take all of your Design Journals and compile them together, also add pretty pictures)/Presentation, Final Report (very similar to Midterm)/Presentation, 5 Maya assignments (you can do them in class!).\nBreathe.  It's just one semester.\n"

STS is a weird class. It is definitely the quintessential science class for people who really try to avoid science. You really need no scientific knowledge to do well in this course. While the class is fairly easy, it really feels like a waste of time, since the class really has nothing do with your work. Nothing, whatsoever. The structure of the class is such: Each class has a weekly assignment, worth 1 point, in which you must cite an article from a recent newspaper, or newsmagazine, etc. about science, technology, and society, and answer a question related to the weekly lecture. There are reading he assigns but they are useless and unnecesarry. The main component of the class is a team research paper (20-25 pages), worth 25 points, and related proejcts, such as a research proposal and topic abstract. There is a book critique, written individually, about a book that you should (theoretically) use in your research paper. So the class ends up being about half group work and half individual work. The grading scale is fine, but is annoying to show up for 2-2.5 hours of class and get nothing out of it. The class can at times be interesting, but othertimes just plan stupid. Perhaps it will tie in more to the classwork in its new form in a year.  \nWorkload:\n(Will likely be different next time class is offered): Wekely 1 point assignments, team paper and related project, individual book critique\n"

The project is worthless as far as engineering is concerned, and a majority of it is busy work. The very premise of the class is flawed. Rather than introducing kids to engineering, it presupposes that the students are already engineers capable of working on a group engineering project. In order to reconcile this, they dilute the projects to the point that they are pretty basic. But rather than this making things easy, they add on constant and tedious busy work.\nOn top of all of that, the grading system is openly subjective, and the TAs were unreasonable and contentious.\nAt the same time, gateway is uesful in some respects. For one, matlab introduces students to computer science and how to think algorithmically which helps for intro to compsci. Maya is a breath of fresh air amidst the project, but its hard to make an argument for its usefulness.\nGateway could be a successful class if Jack McGourty would just heed the dissatisfaction of the students and massively overhaul the approach. At the end of the day, however, there is limited downside to eliminating this class from the curriculum for the simple fact that students; time and parents' money could be used in much more productive ways.\nHands down, gateway was my least favorite class so far at Columbia. Make no mistake, it is likely that you will also be extremely dissatisfied. But SEAS (and Columbia in general) have amazing classes that blow gateway out of the water, so my advice is to just suck it up and be happy when it is over.\nWorkload:\nIt changes each semester, but when I took it, it was basically endless weekly busy work on the project coupled with other weekly assignments.

Your experience in this class depends on two factors, neither within your control:  1. The project to which you are assigned.  Some groups will do almost nothing except for the midterm and final reports/presentations.  Other groups will spend all day every Friday visiting their clients (who were located all over the city, more luck of the draw there) and actually building the thing they are designing.  2. The other factor is your group members.  Maybe you'll get four responsible, hard-working students in your group.  Or you could get a mix of: good workers, people who do little work but say that they'll do plenty so you just don't know whether they'll come through, and complete slackers whom you'll never hear from outside of class.  This is the main reason I say the class is helpful on the whole:  your group is assigned a large project, and you all get the same grade, even though almost every group has people who do more than their share and people who do less than their share.  Sound familiar?  This is what real life is like!  If you hate it that much, maybe engineering is not for you.

Still, he is a nice guy who wants the students to like him and he will usually try to help you with problems.    The grading is fair, although it sometimes seems like points are arbitrarily taken. \nThe main problem with the class is that the bulk of the work accumulates in the midterm presentation and final presentation weeks.\nThe team grades are also given based on how well your team SEEMS to be working together and how much work it SEEMS like they've accomplished.  Basically your experience depends on your team, and there is no way to overcome a lazy team member since reporting this to Jack might jeopardize your grade due to poor team unity.

The idea is absurd; the freshmen are not technically prepared, nor are they intellectually motivated to do what is asked of them. Every student in the class deserves an F, not because they are lazy or incompetent, but because they are not ready for real engineering. The only benefits in this course were a brief introduction to Matlab and Maya software. Not surprisingly, these are the two aspects of the course that Jack does not agree with.

If you're reading CULPA right now, it's not like this review will do you any good, since there ain't no chance that you can get out of Gateway if you're an engineer. You're going to waste three hours of every day. Some days you're going to waste it sitting in class while Jack talks for an hour and a half about how to show somebody a PowerPoint presentation. There was one day this term where we didn't do anything, period, for the first hour and a half. Just sat at the machines, didn't work in our groups, didn't do any work, while the TA's futzed around and the professors waltzed in forty-five minutes late.\nGateway is everything that college should not be. This is to a great extent due to the work of Prof./Dean/whatever Jack McGourty, who has somehow managed to push this monstrosity of a class onto the department. All of the work that you turn in is, in the most literal sense of the word, bullshit. If you're lucky enough to get a practical project, maybe you'll do a little real work, but otherwise you'll fluff up a theory you know nothing about for months.\nJack and everyone who is in any way involved in this class pretty much just drive over the same useless concepts (how to talk to people, etc.) You'll watch videos from Dateline. You'll use a set of totally outdated, useless software that SEAS foists upon you, with a whole different password and logic set from regular CU software. Most importantly, you'll sit in your chair doing nothing and being made fun of.\nBut the view from the window is nice.\nThis class claims to be community service but is an insult to the community -- a bunch of stressed, uninformed and uninterested freshmen are going to build you a new community center using only Matlab and our raw intellectual powers? Keep dreaming. Maybe we should just go out in the field and do problem solving. Or have these three hours a week to get some bloody work done. Good luck, freshman. Persevere and great rewards may or may not follow.\nWorkload:\nA whole lot of dumb crap, objective trees, group meetings, Gantt charts, other meaningless drivel dragged out into about 40 pages of print.

Personally, I felt like I didn't contribute anything to the Gateway project, but then again, I didn't know what I *could* contribute. A lot of class time was wasted just trying to get things in order.\nBut overall, I really can't complain. The class was easy.

As far as I know, Jack, cracking under pressure from the spec and probably from higher up in the engineering school and of course due to his lack of personality and belief in his philosophy, handed out grades that weren\u00c2\u2019t A\u00c2\u2019s. I heard from a group member that individuals in the class received B\u00c2\u2019s. However, in my case, after sweating through the class and contemplating dropping it at one point, I managed to get an A even though I am sure jack did not have time to read 200 individual papers and about 50 group papers in order to be fair. Seems like he pretty much gave out grades according to how good the topic title of the group project sounded. The class requirements are ridiculous, as expected, and as everyone probably already knows: you form a group, pick a topic vaguely having to do with technology, pick a book which you will just skim at best, write a 5 page \u00c2\u201cbook report,\u00c2\u201d and then get together with your group once to slap together a 15 page paper and make a powerpoint slideshow which you will probably not have to present. Because of the unnaturally large size of the class jack had to chose only a few groups to present and then despite that, no one respected his 10 minute rule and only about half the groups ended up presenting. \nBottom line about this class is that it is now a BIG RISK, but if you don\u00c2\u2019t mind going through a whole semester not knowing whether you are going get an A or a C in a three point class (because there is absolutely zero feedback throughout) then this is the class for you. Oh yea, we were also supposed to \u00c2\u201clearn\u00c2\u201d in this class, but I don\u00c2\u2019t think I did very much of that. Class was boring most of the time, Jack\u00c2\u2019s lectures just droned on and were mostly uninteresting (no one wants to hear a 2 hour lecture about the history of bikes!!), and class discussions were disorganized and dominated by only a few people. Out of a class of 200, barely a quarter showed up to class and personally I went to all of 4 classes or so all semester. Jack never ceases to amaze me\u00c2\u2026..and not in a good way, but I shouldn\u00c2\u2019t be complaining right? I should be like one of those people who write \u00c2\u201cjack is amazing\u00c2\u201d in the reviews just because he boosted their GPA\u00c2\u2026.well jack, thanks for the A but the class should definitely be eliminated. The only reason I took it is because I thought it was unfair that people got free A\u00c2\u2019s the semester before (and to make up for a VERY disappointing gateway grade)\nWorkload:\nA 5 page \"book report\" about a book you choose (dont actually have to read the whole thing really), A 15 page group paper (groups of 3 to 5) and a powerpoint slideshow and possible (but highly improbable) 10 minute presentation\n"

There are a great number of engineering-related companies located in NYC, such as coveted Morgan Stanley's IT department. Why would Jack choose those stupid community projects?  First of all,  we do understand that columbia's ongoing manhattanville project needs a lot of community support and cooperation, but it is unfair to sacrifice students' time and tuiton to those petty, pointless projects.

I will concede that matlab may be useful in future classes, as I have personally seen it used in the research setting. How you do in this class depends on only one thing: Jack's particular hormone levels during grading. He told us very directly on the first day that our grade depends on \"whether or not I think your group did work.\" In terms of work, you will be in one of two situations: you will either be the single competent member of your group (and will work day and night to save their a**es), or you will be one of the group members whose largest achievement of the semester is not drooling on him/herself (in which case you will cruise through the class). I can't give you advice about how to be one/ not the other, because it all depends on your demeanor- if you're a hard worker, you'll be working night and day; if you're like the people in my group, you will get an A+ for having a pulse (the philosophy is that the entire group gets one grade, regardless of circumstances).

What was once a relatively painless, quick introduction to computer design has grown into Jack's little pet monstrosity. Rumor has it that Jack was selected for this task because the other deans of the engineering school realized that Jack did NOTHING. So, he became the head of the Gateway course and shifted the emphasis to \"team-building\" and other vague notions. Jack's lectures might be more interesting than Jose's (who lectures about CAD), but Jose is trying to teach a skill, not listen to the sound of his own voice. In addition to his worthless lectures, Jack assigns a lot of pointless homework exercises, mostly featuring PowerPoint. As each semester passes and the feedback is constantly terrible, Jack tries to change the course (and don't worry, he'll pat himself on the back more than once for being responsive to students), but instead of dropping the pointless things that people complain about (e.g. anything that Jack has a hand in), he expands them to attempt to justify their existence. Jack has changed the course from a one day a week 3-point lab course to a course with an whole Jack lecture a week AND a lab. Don't worry though, Jack will praise himself for making the class worth 4 points to reflect these changes- people want LESS not MORE, Jack(ass).

Jack is an engaging professor with great command of the class and a down-to-earth lecture style.  His thought-provoking lecture even made the dry, generic, overidealized subject that is Gateway interesting and relevant (until I stepped out of the classroom).  He also happens to be one of those really nice people who looks at the side of the glass half full.   Even if you don't do well on some assignements or submit a homework slightly late, you'll find Jack more merciful than any of the Lab TAs.  It's very fortunate the he has the final say on your grades.\nAttendance to lectures are required, and so is particpation.  These constraints are annoying but not terrible, since Jack's lecture style is very relaxed.  He shows lots of short movies and has guest speakers from every department in the Engineering School deliver overviews of their departments, during which you could snooze.\nThe lab session (not delivered by Jack, unfortunately) primarily teaches you Matlab and StudioTools, which are much less useful in the real world than, say, C++ and Dreamweaver.  Most people find Matlab very frustrating and StudioTools very time consuming.  You really have to hold back your feelings and pretend you love Matlab & StudioTools to do the work.  How difficult your group project is really depends on the computer programming experience of your fellow group members and how diligent they are.\nBe wary!  The Gateway website says you should expect to work 4 hours per week, a VERY misleading statement.  The first few weeks of the course are fairly easy but the midterm and final projects will consume endless hours of your time.  It's actually pretty ridiculous.  I must have spent eight entire Sundays (morning til' midnight) with my team and on my own \"doing Gateway,\" time that I would have otherwise had totally free.  As the workload is so unevenly distributed throughout the semester, you shold literally start both your midterm and final projects on the very day they are posted, and even if you do it's still a rough workload.\nNevertheless, the final course grading is generous.  if you work hard, you WILL get a grade in the A range.  Think of Gateway as a straightforward test that covers a lot of material.  You'll spend an insane amount of time studying, but then you'll surely do well.  And considering that Gateway's a 4-credit class, that's a very good thing.\nWorkload:\nTwo projects: A personal transporation vehicle (PTV) project and a group project.  Each project involves submitting a midterm and final wirtten report, and the group project also involves a midterm and final PowerPoint presentation.  Collectively, these assignments will wipe your free time away.  Expect to pull many consecutive all-nighters in the Gateway lab (along with three dozen other peers) working on your final StudioTools model.  There are smaller Matlab and StudioTools assignments throughout, and you need to fill out two team developer surveys.  You'll be ecstatic when it's all over.\n"

I hadn't opened the textbook for the entire semester so don't buy it. the couse is completely useless and stupid and a shame of pretigious columbia university\nWorkload:\nyou'll get sh**load of stupid stuff to do.  and it's hard to earn a good grade.  Good Luck\n"

All freshman SEAS don't have to worry about Gateway, just relax, don't be to pysco about the course and you'll be fine. Don't be the overachiever and take Gateway like life or death, its an intro course to all of engineering pretty much. Relax, you'll have plenty of time later to work really hard in SEAS. All the professors for Gateway are cool, don't worry about them. Jack especially is the man, a super nice guy, who wants everyone to enjoy the course and have fun. Overall, no worries about Gateway.\nWorkload:\nSimple stuff, changes every year...but probably never will be too hard. \n"

The class was fun and interesting and he was mosly concerned with the students learning and having  a good time than the usual class politics. Unfortunately, I don't think he will be teaching this class again, but I recommend coming in contact with this man if possible; he teaches Gateway for SEAS\nWorkload:\nNot much, very straight forward, easy A if you try.\n"

He wants everyone to do well and will tailor the course to student preferences as much as he can. He has guest speakers and puts his lectures on power point slides which he hands out at class so it's ok to miss a lecture now and then. The material is very interesting and he always makes himself available to students. \nWorkload:\nVERY EASY. light reading, midterm and final both only 25 mult choice questions that take 30 mins and one 5 pg research paepr on topic of choice\n"

He is a practicing therapist and taught most of the class by sharing illustrative stories about the topic we were covering.  The textbook was very interesting.  He was ALWAYS available outside of class over email or for individual meetings.  He truly cared about how the students enjoyed the course and was willing to tailor it to students' preferences.  He got to know each and every student.  This class was the only one I have ever felt sad that it was over.  DO NOT MISS THIS PROFESSOR!!\nWorkload:\nExtremely fair: short midterm and final (noncumulative) and 5-page paper on any topic of our choice.  4 1-page reflection papers on Textbook case studies.  \n"
