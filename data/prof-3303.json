She is a new faculty-person, but directs her class with the wisdom and poise of someone with many many more years to their career. She is amazingly brilliant, personally charming, incredibly insightful and, yet, extremely humble. She direct class conversation well, clearly is concerned with the success of her students, and in a quiet and unassuming way manages to make a strong instructor presence. The material she presents is not simple but she guides the class through difficult material expertly. I will, in the future, search for her name in class listings and strongly consider a class if it carries her name.\n\n\nWorkload:\nNot light but manageable. Every other week short reaction to pieces to films viewed in class, readings that are sometimes difficult but manageable in quantity. A final paper that requires care and attention.\n\n"
