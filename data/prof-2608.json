It can be hard to get your questions answered during office hours, as he goes on interminable tangents about random topics (he LOVES to talk about where students are from or explain how car batteries work...). the practice problems are really helpful. exams are pretty tough. overall the class requires A LOT of work, you'll probably feel like you're devoting your life to chemistry. but if you really have to take this class (DON'T DO IT if it's just to fulfill the science requirement!), Lessinger is not too bad (from what I've heard about the other chem professors at least)\nWorkload:\nINTENSE: weekly problem set (quite easy, especially if you go to office hours); 3 mid terms, 1 final, weekly lab report; highly recommended weekly practice problem set (takes a long time but very helpful)\n"

He is much nicer during office hours. He will not know you unless you go to office hours, and so he will not really help you unless you go. Oh, and he changed the grading system that he had on the syllabus without telling any of the students.\nWorkload:\nMadass hard problem sets every week that can vary from 6-10 problems. 2 exams, 1 final\n"
