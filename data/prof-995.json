His lectures are fast-paced and filled with information, and he is willing to spend as much time as necessary in office hours for students to learn the material. Challenging but worthwhile. Note: This class is team-taught with John Mutter, each teaches half the semester.\nWorkload:\nweekly quizzes, final (final is not cumulative)\n"
