            "review_content": "\nProfessor Waters was excellent. He's new to Columbia and possibly new to teaching in general, however I have never seen a teacher so well prepared yet capable of going off script. Every class he gave us a sheet containing all the important terms and buildings. He also build the class around five themes that he managed to flesh out and make clear. \nHe also managed to make the discussion sections more substantial than going over what was said in lecture. Each one added to the overall themes and often included short field trips. \nI see a gold nugget in the making. \nWorkload:\nVery reasonable. The readings generally were short articles or passages from architectural books. We wrote five short (500 word) response papers and had four building recognition quizzes. The biggest projects were the final and a visual analysis paper that required you to go to a building and see it, but even this was only five pages and he gave us a month and a half to do it. Nothing felt tedious. \n"
