            "review_content": "\nProfessor Gittens seems like a totally nice woman. She is probably very talented at dance, and she did go to Yale, so she is probably very smart. However, this class (World Dance History) was a joke. It was beyond a joke. I didn't buy the reader and I did extremely well. There are two (joke) papers, a midterm and a final. Every reading is re-capped by an in class presentation by one of your classmates so you never have to do the reading. The material covered is broad but at a middle-school level. Our \"discussions\" about \"issues\" involving culture and dance are laughable. This does fulfill the Cultures in Comparison req so if you need a hilariously easy 5th class, take it. \nWorkload:\nverrrry light - 2 papers, midterm, final. also have to attend 3 out of class performances. \n"
