Readings each week were immense (> 150 pages) and Prof. Hasegawa often assigned a voluminous amount for the same week that major papers were due. The readings weren't well targeted and often covered a wide swarth of material that left the reader confused. \nHe seems quite passive during the seminar and isn't very good at leading discussions, meaning that there are often awkward pauses. Prof. Hasegawa may be a good scholar, but this was a poor experience of a history seminar class for me. \nWorkload:\nHigh. > 150-300 pages of reading a week. Two essays. \n"
