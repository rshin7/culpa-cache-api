            "review_content": "\nLydia's course Philosophy of Art begins with essentialist questions (what is art? what is beauty?) and ends with sociological and political questions (how does art figure in the political realm? how does the institutional art world wield its power to decide on questions of taste? why are there no great women artists?), using selected philosophical texts as markers. The readings are very enjoyable as are Goehr's lectures. \nSometimes, however, her lectures are winding and discursive, in large part because she takes questions. So this class is part seminar, part lecture. I think Goehr is a very visual and abstract thinker. She often draws large abstracted maps of argument and history. And she is clearly very spiritually invested in art too; this makes sense as she comes from a family of artists, a fact she will make sure you know about her. \nThe problem with this course is a lack of direction re writing and argumentation. You will be asked to write on a number of highly open-ended questions--to \"make an argument,\" and yet spend most of your time \"in exposition.\" TAs are open and helpful enough. However, it seems like they keep their standards intentionally esoteric which I don't approve of. \nWorkload:\n3 dense papers in response to hugely open-ended prompts. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis was my first philosophy class at Columbia and I absolutely loved it. Each week we dissected one work on the philosophy of history across two lectures. Professor Goehr effortlessly conducted the class towards a final, full understanding of the works through a combination of question-answer and lecture. As others have said, she is not afraid to call people out if their questions or answers are inadequate, but this never seemed mean-spirited. Instead, it forced the class towards pointed understanding of the philosophical ideas instead of falling prey to diversion, as sometimes happens in the hands of a less skilled and honest professor. Because of their brisk focus, I found these classes to be consistently engaging and downright intellectually thrilling.\n\nWorkload:\nLight. 1 reading a week -- not usually long, but very dense. \n3 2000-word essays graded fairly by the TA.\nAttendance is mandatory.\nI think class participation can help your grade, but I very rarely spoke and that didn't seem to bring my grade down.\nNo midterm or final.\n"

I have become accustomed to the pedagogic style, which is not to spoon feed and coddle, but rather to seriously engage with students, debate, provoke independent thinking, and illuminate misnomers and gaps in knowledge while the class is in session, (as opposed to after the fact, or not at all, which is very much the case with many other profs at CU.) I count the critical thinking skills, and rhetorical and argumentative methods that I have gleaned from Professor Goehr as among my most valuable assets acquired during my BA. This class is arguably one of the most difficult she teaches, music philosophy being a notoriously complex and evasive subject of study. It is advisable to take at least one of her introductory courses to begin to understand what the expectations are, and how aesthetics differs from other branches of philosophy, and perhaps more importantly, how philosophy of music diverges from the philosophy of art. Professor Goehr is a leader in this area of research, so the opportunity to study the subject with her means one is at the forefront of enquiry in the field. As far as I am concerned, this academic challenge is what attending Columbia is all about, and has served me extremely well in my postgraduate studies.\nWorkload:\n1 presentation, 1 13-15 page seminar paper.\n"

Sure, she is very intelligent, but she is unapproachable and condescending to students. The first 2-3 weeks of class, students actively tried to participate in discussion, but by the end of the semester, everyone was afraid to talk because she might wag her finger at you (which she actually did in one class). She plays off her rudeness as if it is just sarcasm, except her sarcasm is not funny. She somehow always managed to talk about herself when lecture on other philosophers, and she did not encourage discussion or critical thought from her students. Often times, when students were giving their presentations, she would interrupt them, tell them they were wrong, and even not let the student finish their presentation.\nWorkload:\nI stopped doing the readings after about 3 classes when I realized Professor Goehr did not encourage discussion in the seminar...\n"

The professor's lecture style is a bit scatterbrained, but she always provided the class with an outline on the board and always explained all concepts fully. The material is very challenging, and it's often supposed to be (this is a philosophy class after all!), but Lydia is able to effectively emphasize the general ideas of the readings without oversimplifying them. Still, you're going to have to do the readings on your own and grapple with them for some time if you want to truly understand them. Curiously, the professor announced in the first class that she did not want to have office hours with any underclassmen or juniors, only seniors. All non-seniors were directed to the TA, Isabel Lerer. Isabel was a great TA, obviously very knowledgeable regarding all of the material, and she really took an interest in the students that went to her for assistance with papers. She also graded most of the papers, and I found her to be a very fair and easy grader. My biggest complaint with this class is that it was at 9am and attendance was taken at every class and required. Since this class was 4 credits and didn't have a midterm, recitation section, or really anything besides 3 short papers, I guess it's fair that it requires attendance. As long as you can get up in the morning, you won't fall asleep in this class; it's too engaging. But if you can't even get yourself out of bed at 9, you might have to skip this one.\nWorkload:\n3 four-page papers each comparing two texts and answering a general question (like \"What is the philosophy of history?\", \"What is the value of knowing the past?\", etc.) and a final\n"

Her style for this class was to intersperse discussion with lecture. It keeps you completely engaged with the material. The material is sometimes difficult, but in class she is able to make clear even the most difficult concepts.  She puts so much energy into each class that you cannot help but respond.

            "review_content": "\ni thought this class was really something, and it would be a very good idea for all history majors like the previous reviewer (those interested in a modicum of the theory behind their field) to take this course.  as for philosophy majors, bear in mind that this course has many people in it, and a great many of them are not philosophy majors and seem to get intimidated in the discussion sections (as noted previously, each week is divided into a Goehr lecture and a discussion section with prof Goehr and the TA alternating each week, between teh Junior senior group and the Freshman Sophmore group.)  both of the T.A.'s (Felix Koch and Oran Moked) were fantastic anyhow, so it was basically a lecture a week and a seminar a week.  at any rate, there is ample opportunity to engage in discussion and it is highly encouraged by both professor Goehr and her T.A.'s, but discussion often flounders based on teh difficulty of the texts, and the fact that the T.A.'s and professor will PUSH you extremely hard. that cannot be emphasized enough, DO NOT TRY TO B.S. because prof Goehr will publicly take you down and it will be unpleasant.  that said, if she feels as if you are asking an honest question, not just --\"Oh is this where hegel fits in?\" where it is clear that if you read the readings hegel couldn't be farther from the point-- she will give you a perfectly fair chance and get into real dialogue with you.  \nnote: the above is not written very consisely, and if you write your papers for this class like that you will get stomped.\nthe point is, we read a great deal of texts that boil down to an entirely new perspective on history each week.  this is something that happens maybe ONCE in your regular history classes...for example that one time when some prof emphasizes \"now remember kiddoes, NO HISTORIAN CAN FREE HIMSELF OF HIS OWN PRECONCEPTIONS ENTIRELY\".  if you thought that point was interesting the first time you heard it, or even the 5th or 6th, then definately take this course and enjoy your newfound understanding of the importance behind your historical study.  philosophy majors, take this course just because Prof. Goehr is fantastic, succinct, and unwilling to b.s. or tolerate b.s. which is a HIGHLY HIGHLY admirable quality for a professor at columbia.  furthermore, its a chance to take a course with her on a subject more accesible to those who don't study aesthetics.  just because its about history doesnt mean it isnt LOADED with ethical, social, moral, political, and of course aesthetic philosophical concepts.  blah blah blah. don't write your papers like this, just take the damn course!\nWorkload:\na relatively small reading a week that will probably own your life.  good example: 7 page reading assignment of a Benjamin essay which takes 4-5 hours of methodical reading and rereading to begin to come somewhere in the very general vicinity of maybe getting it.  two papers, 9 pages each, comparing two of the philosophers we read--don't b.s., and treat the authors fairly! (also do NOT use terms without thoroughly defining them).  that aside, enjoy the course and the lack of a midterm/final!!\n"

She re-words the assigned readings to make them easier to understand, which is helpful to a degree, but leaves a little more to be desired. \nI would always leave the class feeling that I understood the readings thanks to Goehr's outlines, but that an intelligent debate (and by that I am not refering to what seems to be the prevailing consensus among Columbia students that a debate or discussion requires using every multisyllabic word you have ever encountered or needlessly dropping names of every philosopher you've ever read) brimming just under the surface of the lecture was avoided in favor of Goehr's interpretation alone. I think its important for professors to understand that teaching does not so much require presenting their personal views, but providing varied ones which are left open for students to interpret and discuss. \nGoehr's love of her own opinions and interpretations is cemented by the fact that she includes one of her own essays in the course packet and constantly refers to lectures she has conducted around the world or to great minds that she has met over coffee or wine or whatever high-bow intellectuals are drinking these days. Be prepared to hear of some chat she and Danto had at least every other class.

Certainly Prof. Goehr is not God; however, the praise often given to her is, in my opinion, well deserved.  Her lectures were, although long, very engaging and very knowledgable.  Like other lecture classes, participation by students is very limited (perhaps one or two questions at the end of class), which may disappoint some.  Other students may complain that she simply recaps the readings in her lectures, but this criticism seems inappropriate.  The readings are very dense and philosophically involved.  If you think that you can figure out everything that is going on in the texts on your own, you are either extremely brilliant or extremely stupid.  In either case, do not take this class.  Her lectures do very well to clarify complex arguments and ideas.  It is an excellent introduction to aesthetics in western philosophic tradition.  If you are expecting deep discussion and involvement that one would get from a seminar, simply pay more attention to the fact to the course bulletin; its a lecture.  I cannot agree with those who criticize Prof. Goehr as particularly arrogant.  I did not get the same sense.  Although she obviously doesn't want to deal with undergraduates in many respects, there is a reason for it: it is a graduate course.  Yes, the TA is not the best, but Columbia is not know for its aesthetics, so you shouldn't expect brilliant graduate students in the subject.\nWorkload:\nTwo papers of seven pages.

            "review_content": "\nA few notes on Prof. Goehr, particularly in relation to this class... First, in my opinion Goehr does not care about her students. While it's true that most people like her dry wit and (sometimes) interesting lectures, she is not a professor that seems to be in it for the teaching side of things. She defers all her work to her TAs, and refused to read my papers (even though I am a upper division philosophy major who took both of her classes, and had multiple discussions with her outside of class throughout the semester). It's worth noting that she did promise me that she would discuss the concepts I developed in my paper, and would help me develop a reading list for my thesis, but when I asked her a couple weeks later to follow through, she refused, and made little or no attempt to apologize or explain (she did, however, remember our agreement). Although I defended her for most of the semester against friends of mine in the class who disliked her, I finally gave up when I realized that she cares mostly for herself and for Arthur Danto, or at least the sound of his name (which she mentioned every class throughout the semester). For those thinking that perhaps I can't handle her personality described in other reviews, let me make it clear that I could care less about any hurt feelings involved; rather, it was a simple, yet infuriating waste of time, clearly of hers, and apparently of mine. \nThe second point is about the substantive nature of the class: while some of the readings were interesting, and represented a range of ways to discuss and interpret art and related topics from both analytic and contintental perspectives, the class should by no means be a 3000 level course. It is an introductory course, and while she warned the upper division philosophy majors to take her graduate lecture (which I did), with the rarity of courses focused on contintental philosophy or aesthetics, most people stayed in the class regardless, including juniors, who shouldn't be taking (or be forced to take) intro classes in their third year. The topics she chose for the class were pretty engaging, if broad; but the readings, lectures and discussions were deeply inadequate to do anything more than sketch out the problems posed by the topics. \nAlthough there were a couple bright spots on the syllabus (Benjamin, Adorno- although she picked a pretty boring essay of his-, Lowenthal, Danto), most of the syllabus was insufferably shallow. If you have any serious experience with aesthetic theory, particularly from the 19th or 20th centuries, I'd think the class will deeply disappoint you, especially because it sounds so interesting. And if you are seriously interested in continental philosophy, don't accept this class as a substitute for a course that offers real depth and insight- take Carman, or go over to the anthropology department. For the reviewer who mentioned that Goehr is the only continental philosopher in the department, while that may be true (not counting Carman, if you want to argue he takes an analytic approach towards some of the texts he teaches), she is a pathetic excuse for representing the real rigor, passion, and brilliance of continental philosophy.\nThat said, if you want an intro course on Aesthetics, or if you're not seriously interested in the field, or if you're in the Cult of Goehr for whatever reason (that is distubing in itself), you'll probably agree with the positive reviews. \nWorkload:\n2 easy papers- but beware the TAs! They have serious inferiority complexes and grade more sloppily and more severely than professors.\n"

I left the semester feeling that  none of the questions had been answered or even adequately addressed.  The reading material is facinating, but the topics are all over the place.  Goehr (while certainly charismatic and interesting in a dry British way) spends the lectures explaining the reading, rather than analyzing the essays or connnecting them to any broader them. In this way the class seemed disjointed.  In addition, Goehr is always off parading around Europe giving lectures, so students are forced to deal solely with the  pretentious  and pissed off TAs.  \nWorkload:\n2 papers about  6-7 pages in length\nreading for each class, not too much\n"

            "review_content": "\nIt's true, Goehr's students idolize her (myself included) and she loves it. She can be intimidating, insulting, sarcastic, patronizing but she can also make you believe that philosophy, art, and maybe even you really matter. I wholeheartedly recommend this course for both majors and non-majors. But beware of one thing above all:  Goehr relies on her TAs for grading and for leading classes when she's off lecturing somewhere else.  The TAs my semester were terrible at both of those tasks. Nevertheless, an energizing, provocative, eye-opening class. If you feel that the philosophy major is the biggest swindle you've ever been duped into, take this course to help salvage your Columbia education.\nWorkload:\nThe workload is light:  fascinating weekly reading; two 2500 word papers; no exams.\n"

            "review_content": "\nSomeone needs to provide some qualification to all the reviews of Prof Goehr which portray her as a God. Goehr knows her stuff and her lectures do make some good points, but by the end of the two hour period, it was pretty clear from one glance around the class that at least 50-75% were sleepy, tired and itching to get out of the class.... In other words, she's DEFINITELY not the best lecturer I've heard. Also, while I always had pleasant personal encounters with Prof. Goehr, I found her to be a bit full of herself-she knows her stuff but she also knows that she knows it. She loves the way that so many students fawn over her and kiss up-it's not that you have to do this to get a good grade, but you would think that an intelligent professor would see through the fakeness of these brown-nosers.\nWorkload:\n2 7pg papers for undergrads, graded exclusively by the TA; one 14 pager for grads graded by Goehr herself\n"

Her teaching style is something akin to mystic revelation. You will be enlightened after her lectures, though I doubt you'll be able to recount how it happened. Though that doesn't much matter when your hopped up three cups of coffee and there is so much beauty in the world...\nWorkload:\ntwo papers where you can test out your own magic tricks. good luck.\n"

No matter what course she teaches, whether it be philosophy or lit hum, she never fails to make you think, question your beliefs, and leave class realizing that you know absolutely nothing. Her class is challenging. She oftens puts you on the spot and makes you think. She's not afriad to say you're wrong and trust me, she won't spare your feelings. She is absolutely phenomenal. I never dreaded going to my 9 AM philosophy class because I knew that the subject material covered would be fascinating. She keeps you on your toes and never stops making you think. She is the type of professor you pay $38,000 a year for...too bad she is going on sabbatical next year. I recommend any class you can get with her when she returns from Germany.\nWorkload:\nOne midterm paper, one final paper. No exams EVER. Class participation counts so make sure you do the reading (It's interesting material).\n"

Not only is she an awesome person all around, but I feel like I've learned more from her than from most of my other professors combined. She's quite demanding in class and values our effort in discussions far more than papers and exams. Class NEVER feels dull or aimless with Lydia. Some people may feel intimidated when she responds to student's comments with \"no, that's absolutely wrong,\" but you'll leave class much more knowledgeable than with professors who nod sympathetically at every random thought that's thrown out. If you're comfortable deferring to the opinions of a true scholar, you'll like any class she teaches.\nWorkload:\na lot of thinking; one midterm paper, optional final paper; mandatory exams don't really matter\n"
