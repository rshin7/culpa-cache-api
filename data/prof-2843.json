            "review_content": "\nLet this be a requiem to Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CC career, seeing as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no longer teaching this course after this year. In short, Paul makes CC the enjoyable experience that it is supposed to be while also imparting the information within the texts in a brilliantly efficient fashion. He's laid back, catnip to the ladies, and still committed to delivering a quality education. Your notes in this class are as good as gold; Paul covers EVERYTHING you need to know about the texts in class. Additionally, his essays stray from the classical CC model of strict adherence to text and verge into creative writing. Your grade on essays is based not only upon your philosophical arguments but also upon how creative and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fun\u00e2\u20ac\u009d your essay is. The essays are also shockingly manageable because of Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aversion to quote overload. Paul is quite simply everything a CC professor should be. If there was justice in the world, Paul should be put on tenure track now. Of course, this is still Columbia we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about.\nWorkload:\n2 essays per semester (5 pages each), 1 midterm and one final (exact same format, one big essay with a predetermined topic, 4 passage ID essays of which you choose 2 to write about. Synthesis of texts is key). All of this is graded fairly, not overly harsh, yet not cupcake either.\n"

            "review_content": "\nYeah, Paul's laid back, brilliant, good looking, etc., but don't expect an easy A.  He's not extremely difficult, but I found his grading surprisingly harsh for the sort of Culpa reviews he's getting.\nIt's definitely not true that he doesn't care about deadlines.  He's flexible about setting them, but he would also lower grades if papers are late.\nAnd just for kicks, YouTube him.  (or see him live, which some have done)\nWorkload:\nThe problem is that he doesn't require you to participate (no participation grade) and he lectures a lot.  That means no incentive to read...  Overall, it's not too bad...it's just the grading to contend with.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThe previous statements about Paul maybe playing favorites (though maybe not females as some suggested) might be warranted, and his grading is completley ambiguous, but these reviews miss a crucial point about his class. Not only are they fun and entertaining, but I walked away actually thinking I knew the material. Paul let you get away from reading often, rarely citing the text, and often simply focusing on the arguments and the formation. If there was a question he asked and nobody responded, he wouldn't chastised the class but instead simply said the answer himself. He also used modern day examples a lot (and strangely a lot of drug references, which seeing how he's in a band might make sense...) in order to see how we could apply it to today and not 3000 years ago. Sure he might not give you an easy A for just reciting the text (both papers and exams required your own thinking), but he's definitely worth learning from. \nWorkload:\nstandard CC reading, 2 5 page papers, midterm and final\n"

            "review_content": "\nI think that you should come away confused from a discussion about a philosophy text, and feel equipped to explore your confusion using the text, and your mind. This does not happen in Paul Weinfield's class. He gives you \"take away\" points from each author- it feels like a spark notes version of the texts. Everything is very clear after his classes- not because we have thoroughly dissected the texts, but exactly the opposite; we stay away from the texts (he hardly ever references a passage), and simply move down the bullet points that he has in front of him.\nHe tries to explain many concepts using cocaine or sex analogies- as though the only way we could grasp these ideas is if he relates them to rock 'n roll. \nHe's a very minimalist commenter. I've never tried to talk to him about my writing, so maybe that woudl be helpful; I can't complain about his comments utnil I've done that.\nIn general, it sounds as if very few people have caught good cc professors. I would not switch out of his class because the chances that you are going to be even less satisfied are very high. He is a nice guy. he's not boring. and it's kind of fun to have a professor who's a singer/songwriter . it's always fascinating to listen to his songs on his myspace.\nWorkload:\nnot a lot. i wish it were more. i feel like my writing has gotten worse.\n"

Simply, Paul is their favorite professor (for various reasons--both physical and intellectual). These two are obviously not the same. Paul doesn't play favorites, but is equally kind to every student and gives everyone a chance to speak freely--even those who have nothing of substance to say and after which you are left scratching your head wondering what/why/how??... Yet, Paul even manages to turn even these comments into a productive, thought provoking class discussion, which was thoroughly enriching and enjoyable. \nAs mentioned, he is very chilled. If you come in late or have to miss class, he understands that life doesn't always bow to his class. A concept many professors find unintelligible. \nI cannot imagine that there is a better CC professor out there. Having had my share of depressing professors in Columbia, Paul was the one that gave me my faith back on Columbia faculty. \nIf you have him--for anything--CC  a religion class--whatever he is teaching--keep him!!! He is a rare gem. \n\nWorkload:\nThe usual for CC, except Paul really did not care about lateness and whatnot for postings-- nitty gritty bureaucracy is not his thing, thankfully. \nHe is also extremely approachable for any assistance with papers and his ideas/comments are always helpful.\n"

I guess the only downside would be that sometimes he lets the discussion run off topic, but he does a great job of making sure you understand the material.  On top of all that, he also is an amazingly generous grader!\nWorkload:\nNot bad.  2 papers, midterm, and a final.  But the midterm and final are easy, and he grades the papers really easy.

He is very understanding about the need to miss lectures, the reality of having to read obscene amounts for a class (he often encouraged people to speak about the part of the text they may have perused,) and was very approachable outside of class. He is really knowledgable and isn't afraid to speak honestly about his personal feelings towards the philosophers we discussed. His teaching style could use tweaking, perhaps a little more direction for class discussions, but that's to be expected for a first-time CC teacher. All in all Paul made CC a thoroughly enjoyable experience. If you end up with him, you're lucky.\n\nWorkload:\n2 5-pg papers, midterm, final, usual reading (he even cuts it down often.) Very decent grader\n"

He's a grad student in the Religion department but he is very well-informed about philosophy (and other areas of study that he occasionally brings up).\nHe really tries to make CC as painless as possible. He doesn't lecture too much but rather guides and mediates the discussion between students. He also doesnt take attendance and is understanding about needing to miss class.\nHe is a pretty lenient grader. My only complaint about him would be the classes lack focus and sometimes direction. But in general, he is a good instrutor to get for CC. His strength is probably his personality, he is so approachable about anything and is always willing to go over things with students. But that doesnt mean that he isnt extremely intelligent!\nWorkload:\nThe regular crazy reading for cc, though the second semester he was really nice and tried to make it as short as possible. Questions/ comments on the readings due at each class, 2 papers, a midterm and a final.\n"
