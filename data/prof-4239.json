            "review_content": "\nProfessor Weafer is pretty easy by CC standards, but her class became increasingly difficult as I had often 0 motivation to go to BORING class. She essentially lectures about the reading in a CC class and doesn't trust the analytical and intellectual skills of her students to actually engage and discuss the material. I had no motivation to read because she would just spit the information back at us without allowing us a chance to actually engage the ideas the texts espoused. She is a very lenient grader so if you don't actually care about learning anything or being engaged in class I would recommend her. She's a very nice person, but her teaching style made me want to rip my eyes out.\nWorkload:\nEasy: CC reading, 2 papers, midterm/final.\n"
