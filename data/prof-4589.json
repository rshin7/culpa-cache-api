I don't know about other u writing classes, but I'm sure she is one of the best teachers. She is COOL!!!\nWorkload:\nReadings can be overwhelming. It's not that the material is hard, but there are a lot to read (not all the time, though.) They tend to be interesting. There are two big essays (doable) and one bigger essay for the final (also doable, but make sure to put time and effort). She is totally helpful.\n"
