She's very straight forward with what she wants to see from you, and you can actually be good at writing if you take her advice. Be very careful about turning things in on time, there's no wiggle room and she won't look at your work if you turn it in late. Also make sure that you put your complete effort into ALL of your drafts, it is really important to get feedback from her. In a lot of other Uwriting classes you can  bullshit drafts, but in this class you can't. Overall, a great experience, even for an 8:40 class.\nWorkload:\n4 progressions, more than enough time to finish all of them and do them well if you manage your time.\n"
