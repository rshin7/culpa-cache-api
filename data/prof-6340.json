            "review_content": "\nThe class was rumored to be a piece of cake, but the topic of this particular course ended up being the toughest of all. Rodriguez taught the Advanced Language Through Content class on Indigenismo and it was AWFUL. The professor is generally very nice and willing to help but is horrible and untimely when it comes to emails (personal anecdote: i had pneumonia the weekend before the final essay was due, emailed her 4 times for an extension and never got a response) and the readings she assigns are hefty and tiresome. The majority of the essays were in ancient spanish so even a dictionary wasn't even helpful. It's not an impossible course to get through, but if you can choose another topic you should. \nWorkload:\n3-4 long readings every week with a 2 page analysis paper due on the first day of class for that week. Also, 2 powerpoint presentations are expected of each student: one with a partner and one solo. Final is a research paper. \n"
