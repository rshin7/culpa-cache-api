            "review_content": "\nGorup is superb and her Serbo-Croatian classes are a great, if slightly unusual, way to fulfill the language requirement. She is humourous, kind, and a talented teacher who makes a 75 minute 3 day a week class seem surprisingly painless. As a Columbia-trained linguist, you'll learn a lot of technical background about the language . . but don't be scared, the material is well-presented and she is an incredibly easy grader. As a Belgrade native, she will also happily introduce you to the culture that defines this part of the world, and may even cook up a tasty ethnic dish for a class party! Highly recommended.\nWorkload:\nEasy assignments that usually take less than 20 minutes, leniently graded tests every couple of weeks that emcompass the previous lesson's grammar and vocabulary. As long as you keep up with the class the workload is light. A word of warning, though: Serbo-Croatian is a difficult language and the class is full of native speakers who have had previous exposure to the language . . . if you're a complete novice it may be a little rough at first.\n"
