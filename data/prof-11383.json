            "review_content": "\nI thought that Givanni was someone who didn't know the curriculum as well as many other CC preceptors, and was too proud to do the research to overcome these limitations. What she knew, she did know reasonably well, but unfortunately, that wasn't too long a list. She seemed unsure with the Qu'ran, superficial on the Bible, and blundered through most of the later works of first semester (Machiavelli, Locke, etc.). She didn't particularly focus our discussion, and class tended to meander around without a true understanding of the material.\nWorkload:\nStandard CC reading, 2 8-10 page papers, straightforward midterm and final\nher grading is a little different from classes I've had, it's definitely an effort to try to understand her expectations.\n"
