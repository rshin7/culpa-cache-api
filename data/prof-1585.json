            "review_content": "\nLuke is a really nice guy who seems genuinely committed to getting the students into making their own music in the studio.  He knows his shit cold (and if he can't figure it out, James, his TA, can), and puts everyone at ease by being incredibly self-deprecating.  His only teaching flaw seems to be that he lets students hijack the class and go off on tangents for way too long.  Really fun class though, and you basically get a free studio for the whole semester, which is excellent.\nWorkload:\nYou do two pieces at the studio at Prentis.  They can be utter crap, or you can do an entire record, and nobody seems to care either way.  You get a compilation CD at the end with everyone's stuff on it, which is pretty nice.\n"
