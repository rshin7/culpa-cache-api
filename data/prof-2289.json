A rare, rare breed  -- intelligent, articulate, self-effacing, organized, interested, competent -- all that and a sense of humor, too. Save yourself from the certain torture of  some of the Art History deptartment's other TAs and sign up for section with Rachel. \nWorkload:\nA midterm and a final quiz. Two 4-6 papers. Fair and thoughtful grading. \n"

            "review_content": "\nRachel is fabulous! What a great T.A. I had her for two sections, both of which handled fairly challenging subjects, and she was incredibly helpful at clarifying the themes of the lectures and readings (esp. Benjamin Buchloch's jargon). She is also hilarious and enviably hip. If she is TA-ing your class, try to get into her section- it's a smooth move. \nWorkload:\nSo nice and understanding about deadlines/assignments/section attendance. \nFairly easy grader, but mostly because she's good at helping you understand the material. \n"
