She does a great job explaining the material but doesn't pretend to be an expert on all of the subjects. She makes sure to ask questions of the professors who are lecturing to better help the students during seminar. She's really nice and brought in candy for us during halloween and brownies during our last official seminar session. \nShe goes out of her way to help you understand the concepts and only emphasizes the things necessary from the lecture. She's the reason I actually enjoyed taking FroSci this semester even though I absolutely hate any and all sciences. I would definitely suggest her to any student but especially to those who aren't \"science\" people. \nWorkload:\nHomework with every lecture (12 assignments) , 4 quizzes (aren't hard and don't have a heavy affect on the grade), term paper, midterm (hard), and final (hard) \n"
