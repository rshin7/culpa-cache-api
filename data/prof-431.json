            "review_content": "\nI couldn't imagine a more straight forward class. Or a more clear professor.\nFriedman adheres to Chekhov's Gun Principle in all his lectures. He'll mention some tidbit at the beginning; you won't understand it. An hour will pass. You will have scribbled five pages of notes that seem to have no connection from one line to the next. Then with five minutes left, he fires Chekhov's gun, weaves the lecture right back to the tidbit he dropped in the first five minutes. And your newly-connected synapses will high five each other. You will realize pure math is beautiful.\nThe best part of this course was stepping into deeper levels of abstraction week to week. Take quotient groups for example. You start with (Z/nZ) in an isolated case; you learn some rules for (Z/nZ), learn some proofs, and think that's it. Then three weeks later you learn about cosets and quotient groups and realize (Z/nZ) is just one instance of a quotient group. Sure, he could teach about general quotient groups then give Z/nZ as an example. But it's so much cooler to step back from your one example and have all the theorems make sense a month later. Chekhov's gun, people. \nHe types up a great sheet of notes so about half the class skips lecture. Don't do this. He won the Van Doren teaching award for a reason; spending three hours per week in his class is worth it.\nI devoted every Sunday to the problem sets. The entire Sunday. Then I'd take any questions I had to the TA help room Monday morning; the TA from Taiwan is really great, though I can't remember his name. The problem sets are graded pretty harshly; expect points of unless you're perfect, another reason to go to office hours. \nI changed my major from CS to math because of this class. I'm taking his Algebra II course next semester as well because he is stellar. Take anything he offers. \nWorkload:\n14 Problem Sets (one per week). They take a while if you learn the material to do them; you can probably get through them in 3-4 hours if you focus on getting through the problems and don't care about cementing your understanding. Two midterms and a final, all predictable: two or three proofs on each and any computational problems from the homework. I don't think this class is curved at all, and the exam averages are around 90. Math majors are smart, dude. \n"

            "review_content": "\nFriedman is a polarizing guy- just look at the all-or-nothing reviews below this one. Yet, I'm pretty split on him. If Friedman is (in)famous for anything, it's for talking faster than the disclaimers at the end of a medicine commercial. While this isn't untrue, he doesn't actually move through material as quickly as one would expect by counting his words-per-minute, instead drawing out the obvious and writing out every detail to the extent that his proofs are nearly computer-checkable. \nThis isn't entirely bad, especially if modern algebra is your first real proof-based class, but it makes the class appear to move a lot faster than it does and there were some topics we didn't have time to do. For instance, we did very little with symmetries of geometric solids, which is traditionally an important application of group theory.\nThe bright side is that Friedman is pretty devoted to this class. He wrote up solutions for the problem sets, posted review sheets, and held review sessions all to help us prepare for exams. I think he even knows my name but I haven't found a way to test this theory.\nThe exams themselves are all straightforward. He sometimes takes ideas from the homeworks, so doing them is advisable just in case you were on the fence.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets consisting of around 7-10 problems. They're on the easy side since Friedman's \"hints\" on the later ones are just outlines of solutions that you need to fill in. Two midterms and a final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI'd have to disagree with the reviewer below who did not enjoy this class. I think Robert Friedman is a brilliant teacher that will teach his students the mathemagics of Calc II. In class Friedman can go over the concepts really quickly, but if you ask him to go over something he will stop and explain things to you. He constantly is teaching us \"tricks\" (in his words) that enable students to become mathemagicians. Also I found Friedman very approachable and friendly. He would say \"Hi\" to me when he saw me (even when I saw him in Riverside Park). Since Friedman is fast-paced in class, sometimes my notes after class were not very good, but I would go to the book and review the material. This is one thing I would suggest since the class was closely tied to the book. Going over the material in the book helped clarify certain concepts for me. The homework was straight-forward, but hard. Nevertheless, I never went to office hours because the online book gave great examples of how to solve certain problems. The day before every midterm and the final Friedman would hold a review session which would be closely related to the material on the exam. The midterm averages were low. The first midterm had an average of 63% and the second had an average of 73%. I'm not sure what the final exam average was. I ended up getting an A in the class, even though I only had a Calc I background. My first midterm average was an 87% and my second midterm average was a 74%. I got a 96.5% on the final exam. My HW average was a 95%-ish. I put in a considerable amount of work for this class, but I was nowhere near killing myself with work. I would suggest that do practice problems online in order to do well. \nWorkload:\n1 problem set a week. 10-15 WebAssign problems, 3-5 book problems. HW is work 20% overall. 2 midterms (20% each). 1 final (40%)\n"

His lectures were very organized and he made sure to do many example problems or answer any questions we had at any time.  Before our midterms, he would host a review session the night before to make sure we had no doubts about what was going to be on the exam.  Although his homework is challenging, he makes the exams very fair and easier than the homework itself.  Calculus 2 is a difficult class nonetheless so I recommend you choose Professor Friedman if you want to come out of the class knowing the material.\nWorkload:\nWeekly Webassign and book problems (takes about 2 hours max), two midterms (1st: techniques of integration. 2nd: arc length, surface areas of revolution, sequences, series), one final (all of the above including power series and differential equations).\n"

For a Calc II class, I'd say he has made it unduly difficult. Not only was his teaching crazy fast and the exams excruciatingly painful (the median is often below 60, with no more than 4% students over 90) , but he also did not give a slightest damn to those puzzle-ridden students who reached out to him with a lot of problems. Quite often, he will just walk past you and pretend he doesn't know you if you meet him outside class and office hours. Adding to the misery, he does not drop a single homework and he simply doesn't curve in the exams! (He said he did, but you will be crazy to expect a raise more than 2% in an exam where the median is 57 and the SD is around 13)\nAll that being said, my friend also took his class and got an F after struggling through this whole semester. I am probably the only student who got away with an A but that was because I used to have a very solid basis in maths and physics back in high school. Fairly speaking, Friedman's class is too hard and too fast for an average college student with merely Calc I background. If you have any chance to take other professors' classes, AVOID HIM, \"AVOID HIM LIKE A PLAGUE\". \n\nWorkload:\nHomework: usually 15 Webassign problems and 5 written problems from the book. 20% and he drops none of them.\n2 midterms (each 20%)and 1 final(40%).

Calc IV can be hard at times (I took Multi in high school and still struggled) and some people just want to put it on him. He tries his best to teach you the material so he does challenge you, but at the same time he spends a lot of time trying to make sure you'll do well in the class. \nIt's true the curve it's minimal, but he makes the test easy (but some times tricky) enough for everyone to do well so there really is no statistical reason to add one. I think your final grade may be curved a bit. I had about an 87% and that became an A-. Just take a good amount of time before each exam to really break the course down into Layman's terms and list steps on how to solve the problems and you'll do fine. He does so many things to let you know he actually cares.\nWorkload:\nA problem set every week, anywhere from half an hour to 2 hours. They could be hard, but the tests are a lot easier. 20% Homework; 20% each midterm; 40% final. Warning: he does not drop any homework grades!\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Friedman is absolutely brilliant. So brilliant, that he lectures at an insane pace because he assumes that everyone knows exactly what he's talking about. Which is probably about right. The lecture speed takes a little time to getting used to, but maybe that's because he has so much material to cover in a semester. He mentioned at the beginning of the semester, if you want to slow him down, ask questions. \nThe bane of this class is the problem sets. The problem sets are tremendously long and difficult, and if you leave it to the last day to finish, I can guarantee you will be emailing him about an extension. Definitely work in groups, and make use of the TA's office hours and the math help room. The problem sets are incredible though when you figure them out, and they contribute greatly to your understanding of the material. I cannot stress this enough. Some of the examination questions are based off material found in the homeworks. It's very crucial to study each problem closely before each midterm. \nKnow your vocabulary. To the letter. The vocabulary is a huge foundation of the material and he begins every examination with definitions. Memorizing definitions goes a long way to helping you cope with the difficulty of this class. \nFriedman is very receptive during office hours and although it may be a tad intimidating speaking to him one-on-one because of his brilliance, he's very helpful and interested in each student. He is a fantastic professor, and if you are willing to put in the time and effort, you will come out with a greater understanding of algebra. If you're a genius at math you will probably find little to no issues with this class. But if you're like me and you're not gifted at math, then prepare to put in long hours into this class.\nWorkload:\nA problem set every week, anywhere around 5-9 questions. Beware though, many of these questions have multiple parts to them. Two midterms with definitions, true-false, calculations, and 2-3 short proofs. The median on each exam is insanely high (around high 80s, low 90s). Final is more or less the same but more questions. \n"

Do not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I repeat, do not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c miss the opportunity to let this man's radiant brilliance shine forth upon you. \nMuch like, having fallen into the ocean, it is impossible to emerge dry, it is impossible for you not to have become a substantively better human being in every possible respect upon leaving Friedman's classroom after your final exam. Not only will you be an incredible mathematician who will probably solve the 6 remaining Millenium Problems (Friedman already has, he just has no interest in publishing the solutions since he uses them on his problem sets), but you will have the strength of a wild ox, the speed of a cheetah, and will never need to sleep again.\nI should mention that I told a small lie. You and I can't emerge from the ocean dry. Friedman can.\n\nWorkload:\nOne day, while contemplating atop of Mt. Everest, Friedman posed himself the following question: \"What is the purpose of my existence?\" Not only did he give an answer and prove its correctness, but he posted handy notes for meditation after class, and a problem set, due Monday (indeed, it was Wednesday, that most fateful day, when this occurred). Upon reading the notes, the gods smiled; even they had learned something new. \nIndeed, \"work\" is a meaningless construct.

Having had absolutely no background in higher math, and a lot less experience than some of the class, I still truly enjoyed both semesters.  That said, I'm not one to be demoralized by seemingly impossible problem sets, or less than fantastic grades, and didn't ever find that either of those things interfered with my enjoyment of the class.  For those who aren't this way, be wary, but if you are willing to put in the work, you will come out of Friedman's class with a tremendous improvement and a truly deep understanding of what you've learned.  Though all of my classmates that I've talked to have varying opinions on the class itself, we all agreed on that.    \nOften Friedman wont answer questions immediately because he carefully plans out the structure of his classes, and likes to stick to this.  This never bothered me because his lesson plan is brilliant and incredibly well thought out.  I also really liked his teaching style and thought he was very clear, but it may take some getting used to.  He wrote our class notes, which totaled a few hundred pages, himself.  \nThe problem sets are difficult, and existential-crisis-inducing if you decide to start them 12 hours before they are due.  However, they are meant to be done in groups, and they often took my friends and I even longer to finish because they inspired conversations that gave us a deeper understanding of the material.  \nUltimately, I loved this class and was so glad I took it.  Friedman is fantastic, and though the class is incredibly challenging, it is completely worth it.    \n\nWorkload:\na lot.  anywhere between 6 and 15 hours of work a week, depending on the problem set.  usually somewhere in the middle. worth it.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nIf you've done hardcore math before, the previous two reviews will probably apply to you. Otherwise, they really won't. I hope that this one somewhat applies to the rest of us. Granted, even after going through this class, I'm still math majoring, so take my review with a grain of salt. I like to think I'm somewhere in between the (substantial number of) Honors Math A/B dropouts, and the ridiculous kids who didn't come to class yet never missed a point on anything.\nCLASS: In terms of content, the class covers linear algebra and calc III - IV from a proof-based perspective. It also gave students an idea of what's to come, should they start taking upper-level mathematics courses... so definitely not the standard calcIII-IV curriculum. The two biggest additions are proofs (of course there are proofs in the calc sequence, but here they're covered more rigorously, and mostly everything is proven), and adding in n-dimensions, which makes things abstract and non-visualisable. Personally, I thought the smaller asides (usually irrelevant to the course's express topics) were very interesting, once I figured out what the hell they meant. \nThe class is also supposed to help new freshmen think in the \"language\" of higher math. This includes the (sometimes-absurd) notation and thinking in terms of theory, proofs, and n-dimensions - rather than just pictures and examples (not that these aren't helpful, because they really are). \"Help\" is a subjective term, though.\nI don't know if it' the course's intention -or it was just Friedman- but I felt like this class (especially first semester) was a \"baptism by fire\" into higher math. To give the analogy one of my classmates called out in lecture one day: we the students, were like helpless babies thrown into the woods, at the mercy of the wolves, and expected to figure out how to survive. I thought I was good at math. So did everyone else who signed up, I'm sure. Not everyone left feeling that way.\nThe first semester was linear algebra. we went through the topic in a very proof/theory based. Very abstract. Friedman started with linear algebra.\nThe second semester, calculus (with some topology, differential geometry, etc. sprinkled in for good measure) was more computational and less theoretical... again, I don't know if that was Friedman's doing, or just how the course works.\nFirst semester had probably 70-80 kids... on the first day of second semester, though, it was as if half of the class had discovered how to shift into dimension n, n>3 (they disappeared)\nPROFESSOR: Friedman is, well, one of a kind. It's hard to separate the course from him, because he really defined it and made it harder than in years prior, at least from what I hear. \nHe mumbles at times. He sometimes physically (and maybe metaphorically) stands in front of what he's writing/talking about. In class, he chugs through proofs non-stop like the little engine that could. These things are all negatives in a class where a good portion are freshmen who haven't done higher math before. I'm sure any mathematician, or even any math major in the Help Room, could easily transform Friedman's chicken-scratch into concrete calculation. It wasn't that easy for me (and a lot of other kids in the class). Oh, and his handwriting/drawings suck.\nI thought that he really improved in the second semester, though. He started giving more examples, rather than just the proof/theory behind concrete concepts- important for those of us with no previous exposure. I felt that he just generally explained the material more clearly. Class became actually helpful, not just an attempt to set the Guinness World Record for most proofs written in an hour (I use these absurd analogies because I thought the first semester was kind of absurd). Still, if you miss a beat (whether because you space out, or because you don't get how something logically follows in a proof, or anything), you're probably going to be lost for the rest of lecture.\nIn office hours/review sessions, he was totally different. Very helpful and took his time in explaining the concepts. Unfortunately, his review sessions were like therapy sessions: he allotted exactly an hour to this session, and we got exactly an hour - no more, even if lots of people still had questions. Similarly, he himself was only available about four hours a week, and the TAs had 1 office hour between them (in the Math Help Room). Then again, pretty much anyone in the Math Help Room can help you with problems you're having, so it's not the worst thing in the world.\n\nWorkload:\nIt really depends on you/your experience level. This class could be anything from a living hell to a reasonably difficult intro math course. First semester, I got a B. Hoping for an A-/A second semester. \nHW:  For some people, especially first semester, the problem sets took a very long time... not necessarily because the concepts were too difficult, but because it's so easy to get confused/lost in the notation. It's funny how proofs, supposedly so objective and logical, becomes almost an art form where one just has to 'know what to do' to prove something. But in general, these homeworks took forever for me.\nEXAMS: They were significantly easier and much more straightforward than the problem sets, covering the core elements of the topic at hand (linear algebra or calculus) along with a proof or three. If you work to understand everything in the problem sets (which takes quite a bit of work), the exams won't be bad.\nFINALLY, I'm going to give unsolicited advice because I can:\nFor those of you crazy enough to sign up... if you're feeling lost in this class...\n1. Go to the math help room. Find a helpful TA (some of the guys/gals in there are helpful, some aren't). Don't let the TA's sometimes pejorative nature defer you. It's most likely the language that's blocking you, not the concept, and as soon as you understand it you'll probably also think that the concept isn't very hard. But don't just give up on the TA.\n2. Go to friedman's office hours. He'll be happy to explain you the concepts. I really think this is true of any professor, at least any professor that I've had.\n3. Study groups. If you're anything like me, trying to do these PSETs alone is suicidal\n4. Don't give up. It's gonna take a lot of work, especially at the beginning. But if you keep up with the work, and really attempt to understand everything, it'll become manageable. (starting the homework before the weekend is really important to this)\n"

Friedman knows his stuff and the course is well thought out, though he doesn't follow the \"texts\" at all, they're more like supplementary reading. His notes basically cover his lectures and are pretty complete and intuitive. I do agree that the notation is a bit confusing at times, but that can be easily clarified by just asking him or the TA what's up with it. The course is curved, but very little, no big deal. Just go to class, ask questions (not during class, friedman's got lotsa stuff to cover...), start your homework before Monday morning when it's due. It's not an easy course but being a good student should be enough for you to do well...  On a side note, the guy does actually have a sense of humor and is pretty friendly. \nWorkload:\n12-13 psets, grading, LOL. I used to slack off on odd homework assignments beacuse the TA graded easy but they 2nd semester the odd TA changed to one that graded harder than the previous semester's even TA. But the TAs, though inconsistent with one another do grade their homeworks fairly consistently. If you get your homework before the hour it's due, checking answers with peers does wonders to you homework grade. Other than that, exams are very straightforward, no tricks.

He posts class notes online, and they're super helpful when you're studying for exams or just going over material to complete the homework. (Only thing is that he writes really fast sometimes, so it might be a good idea to bring a copy of the current chapter in the notes to class and follow along.)\nClass isn't ever stuffy or boring. He makes a fair number of (slightly lame, but endearing) jokes to lighten it up. His lectures are always really well-prepared and at a good level of difficulty. He'll usually review the hardest part of the previous lecture at the beginning of class, so come to class on time. If you ask him a question or go to office hours, he's always really eager to help and answer your question as fully as possible.\nI found the course itself (Honors Math A/B) incredibly enlightening. In addition to basic linear algebra/multivariable calculus stuff, it introduces you to a whole host of theoretical math topics that give you a taste of \"higher math.\" Some of it relates to physics, and I found that seeing the same material twice, from different points of view, helped me understand it better. This course is a definite must-take if you're considering majoring in mathematics.\nWorkload:\nVery reasonable. One problem set per week (generally 6-9 problems of very reasonable difficulty), which may be computational or proof-based. They take me something like 4 hours total, but I procrastinate a lot. Usually the final problem in each set is an extension of the material to \"real\" math, stuff that mathematicians use in their research. Cool stuff, and always a joy to complete.\n"

I realize that this is the math class for freshmen math majors and more often than not you will not be able to avoid it and this fact only makes all the more terrible that they assigned Friedman to teach it.\nWe spent most of the semester on Linear Algebra and the last 2 weeks or so on properties of real numbers. All the calculus is presumably covered in Honors Math B. The biggest issues with this class are as follows:\n1. You spend hours and hours doing difficult problem sets every weekend. They were assigned on Wednesday nights and due on Mondays. Obviously no one got a chance to look at them till the weekend and hence there was practically no help for the homeworks other than a Friday morning recitation which no one went to because no one started the homework till Friday evening. His office hours, being on Tuesdays(?) and Thursdays are pretty much useless for getting homework help. If you try to write half-assed proofs, you will lose lots of points and do badly in the class so you pretty much have waste your whole weekend on this class.\n2. THERE IS NO TEXTBOOK FOR THIS CLASS. Friedman assigned a textbook because he was obliged to but never referred to or suggested it in class. I tried reading it for a few weeks but it was too advanced and of little help in solving the homeworks. Instead Friedman uploads his own typed notes but they are very confusing, the notation is bewildering and completely unintuitive to a student with little higher math background.\nAs for the lectures, he goes really fast and writes really fast. Most of the time what he said went completely over my head and his handwriting and presentation on the board is abysmal. Basically you either try to take notes or just listen. I would recommend listening, you might absorb something. The notes will just be a somewhat extended version of what he posts online. Going to lecture is probably a good idea just so that you can have a vague idea of what topics/ideas were taught as there is no textbook to refer to.\nHe did not show up to office hours the day before the final and did not send out an email or tell anyone that he wouldn't be there. Everyone who went just waited for 20 minutes and then went home. You would think that the professor who show up to office the day before the final exam but I guess not which just makes me think that he really didn't give a damn about teaching the class.\n\nWorkload:\nHeavy. Weekly problem sets (25%) which can take 6-8 hours given that you can't get help except from your equally lost friends. Shockingly easy midterm (25%) and hard final (50%).

If you are on the fence about taking Honors Math A anyway, and Friedman is the only teacher, then I would say don't take it.\nThe material in the course is extremely fascinating, but it is abstract, and Friedman is incapable of stringing together a coherent sentence, taking notes in an organized or legible fashion, and answering students' questions.  On the first day, he told us that if we did not understand something, we should ask, but he never answered a single question for the entire semester.  He usually just ignored raised hands, but when he did call on someone, he would either say, in irritation, I already covered that, I'm not explaining it again, or, We're not up to that yet, I'm not explaining it yet.  I stopped going to class after Thanksgiving break, and it in no way interfered with my understanding of the material or my grades in the class--this should give you some idea of how useless the lectures were.\nThe recitations were equally useless.  I went to one and it was just the TA repeating what Friedman had said--only it was slightly worse, because Friedman didn't bother to tell the TA what he was teaching, so a lot of the stuff was completely irrelevant.  Furthermore, at least Friedman is brilliant and has a deep understanding of the material he is teaching, even if he doesn't know how to teach, and doesn't much care either; it was obvious that the TAs barely had a handle on the information they were presenting.\nThe grading is something of a nightmare.  Two TAs take turns grading the problem sets.  They just do whatever they want and Friedman does not interfere.  One TA refused to give above a 70/80 no matter what while the other always gave me about a 70/80, even though my problem sets were all about equally correct.  Every student in the class had a similar experience.  Furthermore, the \"nice\" TA then decided to grade out of 40 while the \"evil\" TA graded out of 80...Friedman failed to realize that when taking an average, this meant the \"evil\" TAs homeworks counted for twice the \"nice\" TAs homeworks.  Comments on the homeworks were minimal and useless in terms of understanding how to improve.  Only a few problems a week were graded so you ended up feeling like you wasted a lot of time AND it was just luck whether that one problem you didn't fully understand counted for a third of the homework.  Friedman himself graded the midterm, which was surprisingly easy, yet no body did as well as they expected to/should have.  Why?  I never thought it was possible in math until this class, but Friedman's grading was extremely SUBJECTIVE.  That said, I got an A, thanks to the curve, and I think most people got As or Bs.\nThe low-down?  If you love math, have a strong background in math, are good at math and a creative thinker, and are willing to put in the time to teach yourself the material in addition to doing the absolutely endless (albeit interesting if you understand what's going on--see Workload) problem sets, and there is no other teacher teaching the course, then suffer through it for your love of math and the material, knowing that it's basically like getting credit for teaching the course to yourself.  The one useful thing Friedman does is post a textbook of course notes he wrote himself online.  While not ideal, they are infinitely better than his lecture notes, and I used them to teach myself, and I do think I learned a lot.  He never uses or refers to the textbook you have to buy.  I looked at it once and it just confused me because it uses different notation and terms than Friedman.\nWorkload:\n1 problem set a week, every week, no matter what.  6-10 multi-part problems.  To do it well, work in groups (he actually encourages this on his website) and be prepared for each problem set to take an entire day.\n1 in-class midterm.  Much easier than the problem sets.\n1 final.  Worth way too much considering how much time and effort you put into the homeworks (they only count for 25% of your grade--about 2% a homework).  Easier than the problem sets, but a lot harder than the midterm.  (It was fine for me up until the last problem which I couldn't get at all.)\nWARNNG:  For the exams, he expects you to memorize every theorem, definition, and result that has been coverd.  There are hundreds of them.\n"

He is a wonderful and knowledgeable professor who actually knows how to teach PROPERLY and communicate to students the necessary mathematical intuition. Limited memorization needed if you can follow the lectures (fast, but decent pace, and enough examples to show how to compute the things). Those who have an issue with his handwriting are exaggerating; it is more than readable if you understand what's going on. \nThe proofs that are presented, which the majority of the class hates, are actually necessary to understanding the material. The topics get progressively cooler and more interesting to all who actually care about any type of mathematics, especially when you get to vector fields; although it does get difficult, I got the feeling that Friedman explained Stokes and Divergence Theorem very well that I can now apply it to physics, among other fields. Ultimately, he tied everything together so beautifully by concluding the semester with a discussion about complex numbers, of which his notes are really helpful and can replace any textbook (they still serve me well in higher level applied math courses).\nConclusion on the prof: A+ effort and ability. Very willing to help and generally open to \"intelligent\" comments/ ques. (most of the questions being asked were just plain stupid that even I cannot tolerate them!!! -  no wonder he dismissed them)\nGrading and Workload: \nQuizzes (10%) - time can be a little short if you don't know the material cold, but are very helpful preps for the exams. Manageable if you reviewed at all beforehand. Lowest one dropped.\nAround 14 Problem Sets (10%) - well chosen problems, with a good mix of proofs and applications/computations, and quite easily done in an hour\nTwo Midterms (25% each), Cumulative Final (30%)  - NO proofs; straightforward and almost a replica of the practice exams. Try to work quickly and leave time to check your work, though silly mistakes aren't penalized a lot. \nNo curve; you won't need one since you'll come out with such an \"unbelievable\" understanding of the material due to Friedman's clear explanations that doing well isn't an issue.\nEnjoyable, and possibly best, experience thus far at Columbia.\n \n\nWorkload:\nSee above.\n"

His handwriting, true to past reviews, is horrible (although he does acknowledge the fact on the very first day of class). Part of reason it's so horrible may be the fact that he writes so fast that students can hardly catch up. Make sure to ask him what he wrote if you can't read it ---he won't mind. Also, since he usually writes down a bunch of proofs, which are really helpful to understanding the material (and one should write down), one shouldn't worry too much if something is missed because the proofs ultimately are not on the exams. \nThe main point is that Friedman really knows his stuff. He has the ability to answer just about any question you have on the material. Yes, he might be kind of a prick during class when it comes to answering excessively nitpicky questions, but if you visit him during office hours, he is actually extremely helpful. I don't think he's nearly as arrogant as some of the past reviewers make him out to be.\nConcerning his practice exams, they are almost EXACTLY like his exams. Like the past reviewer said, there might be a slight difference in perhaps parametrizing a paraboloid instead of a sphere, but ultimately, one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance on the practice exam and one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance on the actual exam are highly correlated. \nThe homework problem sets generally aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too bad, except for a few near the end with the complex functions ---find some study buddies in the class! \nIn-class quizzes are pretty much counted for nothing, and the basic gist of them is to give you an idea of what you should know for the exams. \nThe fact of the matter is, material in Calc IV just sucks to learn, no matter who the professor is. I think Friedman is getting a lot of crap for not necessarily being a lousy professor, but for teaching a lousy subject.\nWorkload:\n5 Quizzes --- Not worth much\n14 Problem Sets --- Vary in difficulty\n3 Exams --- If you know how to do every problem on the practice exams and don't make stupid mistakes on the actual exam, you're pretty much set\n"

Perhaps those who are complaining are simply the ones not willing to put in the time and effort to succeed in this class, which frankly, is not a very difficult thing to do.  All you have to do make sure you understand the homework, because the exams will never be harder than the homework.\nAs for his arrogance, I don't know what people are complaining about. He was nice enough to post a practice final when I asked him. He also gave me my midterm outside the classroom when I went to get some water, which was surprising since I hadn't even talked to him before. And he was very helpful during office hours.  Yes, his handwriting sucks, and he writes fast, but grow up. I've seen worse.\nIf you're looking for an easy A, this class probably isn't it. I only said probably, because it is an easy A for some of us. (Hint: I'm an applied math major.) If you want to see a hard class to cry about, go take PDE, Stochastic Models, or Numerical Methods. I apologize if that was a bit of a rant, but I'm sick of seeing people whine about Friedman or Calculus IV. \nWorkload:\nHw-10% Not that difficult.

But he sticks to the schedule like clockwork and is incredibly available \"OH are xx:xx to yy:yy or feel free to just drop by anytime\" and will go as slow as you need in OH.  He also added a weekly TA recitation this semester that was held 1 hour before class on the day the homework was due, which was great for getting help on that one problem you couldn't figure out or that one example in the book that doesn't make sense.\nYes, he gives practice exams, and yes, they are the exact same format as the tests they're practice for.  No, the problems aren't exactly the same, and yes, you might have to parameterize a paraboloid on the test when you only had to deal with a sphere on the practice test.  Expecting the practice and real tests to be identical is ridiculous.\nMake no mistake, this is a hard class.  Not only do you have to memorize a fair number of theorems, formulas and methods, you also have to develop an intuition for thinking about and parameterizing 3-dimensional regions.  And well, this is math, you're really only going to get so much out of lecture.  \nOverall, this is a hard class.

Not only that, but his teaching skills were severely lacking.

            "review_content": "\nIf you are a (prospective) math major, or just a lover of math, you NEED to take a class with robert friedman. if not, run far, far away! as a fellow number geek, robert friedman rocks my mathematical world. his lectures are engaging and interesting...he goes at a very fast pace, but thoroughly covers the material. he is a fair grader and his exams are straightforward and almost predicatable. if you put a lot of effort into completing and really understanding the homework, you should easily do well on the exams/in the course, since generally the homework is much more difficult than the exams. highly knowledgeable and somewhat quirky, friedman is an excellent prof. although, i would advise any one who is not a math major/who has no interest in mathematics to avoid friedman at all costs. \nWorkload:\nheavy. but you learn ALOT and the work definitely pays off in the end. a plus is that friedman always gives you fairly interesting problems to work on (since he writes up many of his problems himself) and so you aren't stuck being pissed off that you are wasting time on stupid, boring calculations.\n"

His exams are straightforward, and the homework is short and easy. Do the homework, skip the class, study, and you'll probably get an A if you're smart. If you're not math oriented, stay far away from this class.\nWorkload:\nWeekly quiz, optional homework, 2 midterms, final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Friedman is evil. He is a boring lecturer who often refuses to answer reasonable questions which he dismisses as \"stupid.\" His tests are difficult, harshly graded, and there's not always a curve to help you out. His status as a native english speaker does little to make his lectures comprehensible. If you are taking one of his note-based classes, I'm sorry but he stands in front of whatever he just wrote on the board, and then erases it when he moves out of the way. Stay away. Stay far, far away.\nWorkload:\nImpossible problem sets that induce a great deal of misery. Looking at his problem sets is like being given a WWII German war code upside down hanging from your left pinky toe.\n"
