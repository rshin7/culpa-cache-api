            "review_content": "\nAlthough this might be interesting for an Art History major, I personally found it pretty boring, and I would not recommend this as the class you take to fulfill your art requirement.  It's very difficult to do well in that for the exams you have to memorize the name of the piece, artist, time period, culture in which it was founded, and medium.  You also have to memorize all of these ridiculous details about the work of art that are based on these far reaching concepts like \"materiality\" and \"form\" and \"directionality.\"  Basically if you show up to class and write everything down that Moxey says, and show up to discusson and write down everything the TA says, you should be okay, it's just really hard to concentrate.  Moxey drones on and on, mumbles under this delusion that everyone can hear him, and barely teaches; the class is basically taught by a host of guest lecturers who each assign a ton of readings.  The class begins with Moxey giving a short history over the topic of the day, saying he knows nothing about the topic, then handing it onto the guest lecturer, who says the same thing he does only in more detail, leading to your notes becoming very disorganized given the fact that one piece of art can be spoken about multiple times.  The TAs are pretty helpful and willing to meet with you, and are especially nice if you seem like you're interested in the topic (just pretend; it's worth it).  Just go to class and write down everything everyone says and memorize most of it the night before and you can skate by with a B.\nWorkload:\nA ton of readings I never did, a pretty difficult midterm and final (as in you have to memorize every piece of art we talk about at length), two essays, and weekly discussion sections that you must participate in.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nI have very mixed feelings about this class after having just taken the final. This is an intro class, and so at least twelve \"types\" of art are introduced over the length of the semester, with a focus on one each week. Professor Moxey only lecturers at the beginning of the semester and at the end, and introduces each guest lecturer while providing a quick summary of what the guest will cover. Depending on the lecturer, a week can be fantastically interesting or painfully boring. It's gold when the head of a department from the Met comes -- but that isn't always. The midterm and final are very straightforward, and as long as you make flashcards or find a way to memorize the art's relevant information (which is all provided prior to the exam in a handy powerpoint format) you will do fine on the exams. I stopped reading the weekly assignments and had no problem grasping the material. Weekly hour-long discussion sections sound brutal, but my TA was fantastic and made the exams that much easier. This class is great if you aren't an Art History major -- but be warned that you cannot hear Moxey if you sit more than five rows back, and at times his lecturing can sound entitled and pretentious. Not an easy A, but attainable if you put a bit of effort in.\nPositives: If you have a nice TA and prepare for the exams, the class is close to a breeze. Also, you actually learn something.\nNegatives: The first 15 minutes of class are an utter waste of time, and by the end of the semester you'll wonder if it was worth it in the end.\nWorkload:\nWeekly reading, which at times was no more than a short article but could also be impossibly dense (it really depended on the guest lecturer of the week). Three very short papers which were responses to the mandatory museum visits, were given far in advance, and were graded by your TA. One midterm with around 10 IDs of specific images, a handful of comparisons, and an essay (you could choose from two topics). The final exam was not cumulative, and was structured similarly but with fewer IDs and comparisons (people complained about not having enough time during the midterm, and so more time was given for each image but the required length of each ID was increased). \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis course was not really taught my Moxey himself but by a series of professors. None of them were particularly engaging and often rushed through major works of art (come on 3 minutes on Chartres cathedral is just not okay). Moxey does not grade you but your TA does, and because of the vast amount of material covered, they were often unable to go in depth for certain periods. I learned a lot about religion and culture, but I wish we could have done more close analysis of the works. Unfortunately, time doesn't allow for this. \nYou have to attend a weekly discussion section. My TA was lovely but she was a first year and due to lack of experience had some trouble leading the section and stimulating discussion (though by the last few weeks she seemed to have mastered it). The section counts for 20% of your grade, so you should definitely go and bring up some points from the readings. \nThe exam format was rather stressful, but this is typical of any art history class. Because of the time limit, I found that the TAs were lenient in grading these. There are 2 papers which were interesting to write and made you think about cross cultural connections and the overlaps between art with  religion and politics. I guess the grading depends on your TA, though I feel like in this course they aren't harsh. \nWeekly readings are not always necessary and they tell you which ones to go over for exams. As boring as the textbook is it is helpful for background info. \nWorkload:\nWeekly reading that seems like a lot but isn't all necessary to do. 2 papers given out very far in advance and easily graded. Straightfoward Midterm with 8 Ids 3 comparisons and an essay. Final was more difficult: 10 Ids 4 comparisons and 2 essays. Just memorize memorize memorize!!!!! Also weekly discussion section and 2 museum visits that are pretty fun. Not too bad through at times it seemed like way too much for 1 class. \n"

Professor Moxey was an excellent lecturer and was often quite funny when he could not figure out how to use the computer correctly!  I really learned a lot about history, not just art, and about how to look at art.  The lecture part of the class consists of a number of guest speakers, some of whom are much better than others.  There is also a once a week discussion section with a TA that helps solidify the massive amount of material that this course covers.  However, the TA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seem to vary a lot.  I enjoyed the guided museum visits and I found the lectures to be generally interesting and informative.  This class would have been a lot easier if I had a broader knowledge of Christianity.\nWorkload:\nThere is a once a week hour-long discussion section with a TA.  Participation in the section does affect your grade in the class.  There are usually about two chapters of reading in the textbook and about four articles to read (from the reader) per week.  There is a lot of reading but it is probably not necessary to actually read all of it.  There were two papers: one was 3-5 pages and the other was 5-7 pages.  There were two museum visits: one to the MET and one to the Cloisters.  The papers also require you to go the MET.  There is a midterm and a final that each had around 70-80 slides and require identifications, comparisons, and an essay.  The midterm and a final require a lot of memorization and large time commitment!   This is a four point class for a reason!  If you have a bad memory, this is NOT a good choice for you!!!\n"

The rest of the lectures (except for a few at the end on the Renaissance) were taught by different instructors who specialized in that area. A couple of them were pretty good, but for the most part, the class went downhill from there. With so many different lecturers, the class became inconsistent and the general ideas were lost as we kept transitioning from one person to the next. There were definitely a few lectures that were still interesting, but overall the class was confusing and I felt as though I never really had the whole scope of what was going on. The textbook was absolutely useless and sometimes even more confusing. The articles we had to read additionally in the reader were actually pretty interesting, (although several were completely irrelevant and confusing). A discussion section was held ever week as well, and that really depended on your TA (I would suggest Joyce).\nWorkload:\nReadings w/ every class, two papers (conference w/ your TA, it make a difference), a midterm, a final, two museum visits\n"

Don't take this class as your first foray into the study of Art History, or like me, you will hate the subject forever after. I DO reccomend this if you have taken other art hist classes because then you can be one of the few people who actually talks during your section with your TA.

In the end, you end up with not only a survey course in art history, but of the Columbia art history professors which will pay off later.  The most important piece advice I have is to choose your TA wisely.  Anything the guest professor fails to explain but Professor Moxey still thinks important, your TA will be the one teaching it to you.
