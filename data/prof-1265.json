The levels in the class ranged dramatically but she catered to everyone's needs wonderfully.  She was very encouraging and really helped everyone improve their strokes no matter their skill.\nWorkload:\nPE attendance policy.... although Luci was rather lenient. Although she takes attendance everyday, I'm pretty sure I missed more than the allowed amount but passed anyways. maybe i didn't. but i'm pretty sure i did. also she was really good about letting everyone know about make-up opportunities.\n"
