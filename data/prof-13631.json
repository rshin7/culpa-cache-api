When you ask him a question he answers it thoroughly and with precision. His lectures were energized and interesting. He also created a nice group interactive atmosphere in the class. He really cares about his students and seems to enjoy teaching. I learned a lot and felt lucky to have him for UW, and I definitely recommend taking his class.\nWorkload:\nUW is a standard work load for everyone. Prepare to have the 3rd quarter of your semester be the  heaviest in this class, as that's when you have to do the most in depth paper. The key to this class is write your drafts early, don't do things last minute. It's much more enjoyable when you stay ahead of the game. \n"
