            "review_content": "\nThough there are no tests in the class- and Dr. Mangels' writes very difficult exams- you are required to write a weekly 2-page (single-spaced, often difficult to squeeze onto the two pages) as well as pair up with a student and lead an entire lecture. The amount of reading is very heavy- the articles are often interesting but the text, which you only use during the first half of the class, is long and painfully boring/dense. Dr. Mangels is a great lecturer and discussion leader and the class is really interesting. The seminar leading on your own will probably take a good 20 - 30 hours of preparation/\nresearch.  If you like neuroscience, definitely take the course! If you like Dr. Mangles from Mind, Brain and Behavior definitely take the class! It was a really interesting class and Dr. Mangles really knows how to pick good material to keep you interested. I highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in psychology/or neuroscience.\nWorkload:\nA few chapters a week (each about 30-40 pages of VERY dense material) or 3-5 articles. Lots of reading. You have to post questions the day before the class. A 2-page single-spaced essay once a week, you can drop a total of five though. One presentation that you and a partner have to run a seminar, LOTS of prep. But the class is all worth it!\n"

            "review_content": "\nI generally concur with the other reviews on here, but want to stress that Dr. Mangels is a phenomenal professor, in my opinion. The course was very difficult, disproportionately so for an introductory level course. However, the material was really interesting, and practical and current - - significantly moreso than in the other intro psych course (Science of Psych)- - and Dr. Mangels is interesting, clear, concise and totally transparent as a professor. You know exactly what you need to do, need to know, what opportunities will help push you forward in the class. Whether you have the time or inclination to actually do them is another issue, but I think Dr. Mangels is the kind of professor who can inspire someone to choose neuropsychology as a future profession - which is pretty powerful and I am grateful that someone of this caliber is teaching an intro level course. \nThe self tests were very difficult but very useful for the exams. There was a lot of anatomy and a lot of memorization in that area, which is rough for some (like me) but doable if you set your mind to it.  The first two exams were reasonable and the final was quite difficult, but she gives you very clear review sheets for every exam. Stick to them and you will be in good shape.\nWorkload:\n3 exams, first 2 are not cumulative, the third is.  Optional self tests throughout the course as well as extra credit readings and lectures.  A lot of material but it is useful and ties together nicely.\n"

            "review_content": "\nWhat is everyone talking about?  \"All of the neuroscience majors throw off the curve too much\"--\"This class is overwhelming and hard.\"  Look, you have to know what you're getting into from the beginning.  If you want an easy class to fulfill a science requirement, don't go with this one.  At the same time, you don't have to be in the field to appreciate it.  \nI am by no means a neuroscience major: after high school I vowed never to take another math class again.  I am a freshman.  I did take this class to fulfill my science requirement and yet I finished the class with a freakin' A+.  It was the last thing I expected.  After looking on CULPA before I took it I was petrified, but I took it anyway because I didn't have many other options and I think it's interesting.  If you don't think it's interesting, don't take it.  This has to be something you like to learn about.  \nYes, there's an insane amount of information in the class, but it comes part and parcel with COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE.  That's exactly what the class is.  She gives extra credit--that's so generous!  Yes, it often takes more than an hour to successfully complete a self test, but you should do it anyway because that information is almost always covered in some form on the exam.  Yes, it forces you to go back through your old notes, but you're going to have to do that anyway to study!  You might as well get credit for it.  Be prepared to do your work and you'll be fine.  \nDr. Mangels' lectures are extremely interesting and she's a very nice person--even by the negative reviewers that seems to be undisputed.  I only realized after the class has ended how much I truly enjoyed it.  It has affected the way that I think and view the world.  Incredible.\nWorkload:\n3 tests and 11 weekly self-tests.  You will want to get that extra credit which requires about 8 of 11 self-tests completely successfully (at least 75% of the questions right).  They're a decent commitment, but so is the class.  Know what you're getting into and it's an incredible learning experience.  I'm still babbling about neuroscience to my family over break.\n"

            "review_content": "\nLike the previous reviewer, I had a love-hate relationship with this course.  I found most of the material very interesting, but had a strong distaste for Mangels\u00c2\u2019 approach to teaching.\nThere were some good things: Mangels is quite organized and her lectures are fairly easy to follow.  She incorporates video, overheads, and blackboard notes pretty well.  Our TAs were knowledgeable and tried to be helpful.  Mangels herself is a fairly nice woman, enthusiastic, and happy to answer questions during lecture.\nAll of the good aspects aside, I still would not recommend this class to anyone who did not have BOTH a strong interest in psychology (or rather, brain anatomy) and lots of time to devote to studying ridiculously detailed anatomical details of the brain.  There is practically no understanding required to do well in this course, just memorization.  For example, although you will have no idea what a superior olivary nucleus IS, you will be required to know that it is part of the auditory pathway.  Anyone who has to take MBB for whatever reason (psych or neuroscience majors), I\u00c2\u2019ve heard that Weidenmeyer (who teaches second semester) is a much more reasonable professor (and has an accent to boot).\nMangels\u00c2\u2019 biggest fault is that she attempts to teach far too much.  She covers a lot of topics (it\u00c2\u2019s an overwhelming amount) and most of them are interesting.  She teaches each topic in great detail, so you will undoubtedly learn a ton in this class.  However, to eke out a decent grade, you will work hard.  Probably harder than for any other intro course you take.  (Note this was a 3 pt 1000-level class, but it felt like a 4 pt 3000-level class in terms of workload)  It is not the class itself that is hard \u00c2\u2013 it is Mangels\u00c2\u2019 approach to teaching it.  \nFor example, her exams cover the minutest detail \u00c2\u2013 stuff you would never think would be on an exam.  Your whole grade will be based on your exam grades.  Mangels claims that her optional self-tests can help \u00c2\u201cnudge\u00c2\u201d your grade upwards if you are borderline by the end of the semester.  But don\u00c2\u2019t bother unless you plan on doing all of them or a large majority of them.  She does not consider doing 5 or 6 of the 11 self-tests \u00c2\u201cnudge-worthy.\u00c2\u201d  Moreover, they will take your several hours to do correctly, and you will not get any credit for them unless they are at least 80 percent correct.\nMy opinion may be skewed because I had a very full schedule when I took this class.  I am pre-med and was also taking bio and orgo.  I was considering a neuroscience major, but now I am not.  I\u00c2\u2019m pretty sure I would have enjoyed the class more if I had more time dedicate to it.  But I ended up feeling like I devoted hours and hours of time to this class that I did not really have to spare, and my grade did not reflect my effort.  I studied more for the final exam for this class than for my orgo final.  I pulled an A in orgo and got a B+ in this class. Take from that what you will.\nWorkload:\n2 exams during the semester and a final.  A lot of reading, but I never cracked the book, which was useless and convoluted.  The exam questions  will test your memorization ability, not your ability to learn.  Self-tests are generally useless and take a few hours if you want to get credit.\n"

As the reviewer before me stated, this is a 3 unit, 1000 level class.  Dr. Mangels' expectations are unreasonable.  This is evident in her rigid teaching style.  She covers an enormous amount of material each and every class, sticking to her lesson plan.  She appears annoyed with questions from students because the questions cut into her pre-programmed structure.  This leaves little room for spontaneity in the class and real learning gets lost.  I would never recommend this class to anyone.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI had a love-hate relationship with this course.  Ultimately, I can't recommend it.   I\u00c2\u2019ll begin with the good (and there is quite a bit): Jennifer Mangels is a fantastic lecturer.  She integrates powerpoint, overheads, the chalkboard and great movies to present the material in a fun and interesting way.  She often gives cute anecdotes and nmemonic which make the material easier to learn and remember.  The TAs were great \u00c2\u2013 they always explained things clearly, and the two guest lectures they gave were good.\nThat being said, the workload of this class was RIDICULOUS.  Although none of the material was particularly difficult, there was TONS OF IT and the level of detail is overwhelming, requiring tons of studying and memorization time.  The review sheet for the final exam was SEVEN PAGES LONG, and that was only half of the exam (unlike most classes, this final is truly cumulative).  I quickly began dreading the weekly self-tests which required me to go back hunting through my notes (and the book) for the most minor details.  The book does a really terrible job explaining things, but they might be switching to another book next year.  \nAlthough many of the lectures presented really interesting material, some were excruciatingly dry (for example, the architecture of the hippocampus) and required pure memorization.  On a few lectures, she didn\u00c2\u2019t manage her time well and spent the last 10 minutes writing the material on the board (as we frantically copied it down) without explaining it \u00c2\u2013 it's like Dr. Mangels feels this strange obligation to get through an absurd amount of material.  For example, she didn\u00c2\u2019t have time to teach us about Schizophrenia, but she required us to teach ourselves that section (as if i didn\u00c2\u2019t have enough to do while preparing for finals!)  As an earlier reviewer said, it is as if she believes this class is every student\u00c2\u2019s sole purpose in life. \nThe tests, each consisting of 70 multiple choice questions (the final was an absurd 144 questions) were really frustrating and easy to screw up even if you knew the material.  The questions often asked REALLY minor details (sometimes pure memorization) \u00c2\u2013 details that any normal person studying for this exam would conclude \u00c2\u201cthere\u00c2\u2019s no way she\u00c2\u2019ll ask that\u00c2\u201d \u00c2\u2013 but she does...\nSO, TO SUMMARIZE: Great lectures, great TAs, material sometimes fascinating sometimes boring, large workload, harsh grading, way too much material and way too much detail (especially for a 3 point, 1000 level class) = a painful experience = avoid this course.  It's not worth the pain\nWorkload:\n3 difficult tricky tests.  If you are going to take this course, take advantage of the many Extra Credit opportunities (attend science lectures, read extra scientific articles)\n"

The class itself, though, is really hard.  I went into it having taken 4 other psychology classes here (including ones about the brain & cognition) and found this course to go more in depth with every subject... which means a lot of studying for exams.  I personally thought the exams were hard, but extra credit counts for a lot.  She mentions that she curves exams - the first one a lot of people did well on, so no curve, the second was only curved 3 points and the final 8 (out of 144).  So basically don't count on much of a curve.  If you're willing to put in the work it's a good class but be ready to work hard... about 9% of our class failed and another 13% or so got Ds as final grades... and with a bunch of junior & senior psych and neuroscience majors in the course, it's basically study your ass off and get an A or B or don't study too much and fail.  \n\nWorkload:\n3 exams (first 2 are non-cumulative, final is cumulative).  Not much of a curve, but that depends more on people in your class & how they perform.  You can earn a bunch of points though with extra credit - they boosted me up a lot.  Self tests every week are optional but if you are within 1% of a letter grade then you get bumped up as long as you have 80% or better on 80% or more of the self tests.  \n"

The nature of the course is such that the first half of the semester is mostly biology, and you may decide that this is not your cup-of-tea, but that in no way qualifies it as a boring, misguided course.  I found Dr. Mangels to be a fascinating lecturer, and I felt that she is just an amazing person.  For example, in one of her interactive experiments, one of the test words was 'terrorist.'  After the experiment, she made a side-comment that \"much later, you'll tell your grandkids that you had this experiment, and you still remember the word 'terrorist' being in it, and they'll say, 'What's a terrorist, grandpa?'  Wouldn't that be nice?\"  Dr. Mangels' human side made it such a pleasure for me to learn from her.

This was the course which motivated me to become a Neuroscience and Behavior major; if you're considering it at all Mangels is definitely the professor to take this class with.

Let me dish you in on Professor Mangels good qualities first: 1.) she knows her field; 2.) she can answer almost any question you throw at her about the material; and 3.) most of the time she is a good lecturer.  However, the bad outweighs the good!  I respect Professor Mangels b/c she is a very intelligent woman but she needs to have at least a little compassion for her students!  First and foremost, she needs to get GOOD TA's b/c ours were no help at all!  The truth is if you are not good in science DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!  Please while you are still ahead, LEAVE!  Basically, the whole field of neuroscience is what you are responsible for--from 19th century Phrenology to the real nitty gritty like \"visual primitive\" and beyond.  The exams are horribly difficult and viciously/shrewdly deceptive .  The majority of the questions on the exams, you have to read more than twice--to make sure there are no hidden tricks.  She does give out a review outline for every exam but if you are taking more than just this class it can almost be impossible to get through the entire outline. And trust me I started studying as soon as the outline was posted on courseworks!  But it is as if she believes this class is every students soul purpose.  There is too much material you must MEMORIZE for each exam.  Furthermore, the review sessions that the TA's hold in case you have any questions, are no help either.  They either tell you to refer to the book on page blah or they totally misinterpret your question.  They do not elaborate at all.  Finally, the extra credit self-tests are Bulls***!  You have the option of doing them and if you do decide to, you MUST get at least 80% correct in order to get any credit.  They too are dreadful!  I spent agonizing nights pulling my hair out on finishing the exams only to find that I recieved no credit b/c I got 1out of 10 questions wrong (the question I got wrong was worth 1 point more than the rest).  I wanted to be a psychology major but the psychology at Columbia College and General Studies is completely different from most institutions.  I have changed my major, do you see how traumatized I am?  Additionally, for all of you who think I am stupid and that is why I am giving Professor Mangels a bad review, no, you're wrong!  I passed the class well off too! \nWorkload:\nYou have 3 exams!  Exam #1 was 60 multiple choice and extra credit question.  Exam # 2 was 65 m/c and 2 extra credit questions.

            "review_content": "\nI hate this class. 1) The name of the class is complete shit - it has nothing to do with mind or behavior. just brain, brain, brain. This is NOT a psychology course - this is a biology course - cognitive neuroscience. If you're trying to avoid taking a bio course for the science requirement, you fail with this class, even though it's in the psychology department. 2) Jennifer Mangels is an obnoxious, condescending professor with immature and preconceived notions of how to run a class. She makes everyone sign an attendance sheet (ostensibly only for extra credit, but the curve changes this - see below). She and the textbook manage to come up with a new word basically every sentence. She treats students like children, has a completely hands - off approach by having the TA's do *everything*, and is just plain an annoying speaker to have to listen to twice a week. 3) the course is pure memorization. the first exam had a question with about 20 parts, asking you to label every single fucking part of the brain. no comprehension, no analysis, just memorization. 4) the grading system is unbelievable. There is extra credit on exams, there is also extra credit for attendance (but only if you attend each and every godforsaken class) , and there is extra credit for handing in optional self-tests. The self tests are extremely annoying, by the way. The point is, a curve is instituted, but she doesn't institute a curve based on raw scores -she looks at all the extra credit, and if she likes the distribution with that, then she doesn't do a curve. so if you don't do extra credit, you get screwed.\nWorkload:\nnot bad, but if you do all the self tests, extra credit, attendance, it's brutal. don't take this class. it's not worth it. take something else for science requirement. you've been warned.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAre these people joking with their reviews? This is the single worst class I have taken in Columbia. Mangels treats it like a high school class! She assigns \"optional study questions\" every week, \"extra credit\" readings on tests, and gives extra points for perfect attendence, but the class grades are CURVED. If you want to get an A, you have to do most of the extra work and come to EVERY class at 9AM. Still, the class would be \"ok\" if Mangels knew how to organize information. There is an incredible amount of memorization involved and Mangels just throws it at you in arbitrary categories. Go over your notes while studying for the final and you'll have no idea whats important and whats not. So EVERYTHING becomes important. Studying for her tests will take your youth away from you. I got an A in the class and I'm pleading with you not to take it. It is simply not worth it. \nWorkload:\n2 midterms and final, reading assignments (required and optional)\n"

Professor Mangels is very engaging and a fantastic lecturer. My only warning: this course doesn't discuss any interesting psychological concepts until the last few weeks of the course, until then it's almost entirely neuroscience. If you're willing to put up with lecture after lecture on neurons, this class is definitely worth it: there's very little work of any kind, and only 3 straightforward multiple choice tests.\nWorkload:\n3 multiple choice tests: that's it. It does require a lot of memorization, but it's easy to get a C or B in the class with very little studying.\n"

Even at the dreadful hour of 9:10am she is fresh, awake and ready to go, always trying to throw in the occassional joke to keep the class awake. She also does everything possible to help her students learn. Every lecture is taped and all the materials used in class are put on reserve. She gives extra credit for going every time. Nevertheless, she still expects alot from her students, as evident by the test. Still most people get an \"A\", I think about 40 percent of the class.\nWorkload:\nThree exams that are really specific.\n"

Even at 9 a.m. her lectures are dynamic, engaging, and remarkably interesting. The material is always clear and well presented. She makes a special effort to incorporate slides, videos, and the web. If a dull moment ever occurs, she'll rattle off a joke about the time she was having an MRI (something you talk about in the class) and major problems occurred because she forgot to take off her underwire bra.\nWorkload:\n3 fairly difficult exams comprise the entire grade. Optional extra credit is offered, but it isn't worth a significant amount of points and is exceedingly difficult and tedious, and therefore not worth doing.\n"
