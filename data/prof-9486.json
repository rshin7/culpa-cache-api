            "review_content": "\nProfessor Yin clearly has good intentions, but his classroom delivery needs a lot of work. His handwriting is difficult to read and his accent is hard to understand, even for a Chinese-speaking student like myself who is accustomed to accents. Nevertheless, Yin makes up for those shortcomings by being extremely passionate about teaching and ensuring that the class as a whole does well. He truly cares about students, going so far as to offer makeup exams for both midterms. His problem sets are difficult, but fair (and relatively short), and certainly do-able if you read the textbook. \nAttending class is essentially pointless, since the textbook for the course is all you need to pass. Class meets three times a week for 50 minutes each, which is completely idiotic and ruins everyone's Friday.\nWorkload:\n1 problem set each week (3 required problems will get you 9/10 points, doing the remaining 5-6 will get you the final point), 2 midterms (offered makeup exams both times for students who did poorly), 1 final\n"
