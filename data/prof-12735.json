To him \"getting a B is actually a good grade\"\nSo don't expect to get an A if you don't work like crazy. You already have to work hard for a B. It's really unfair, especially when you compare it to other University Writing professors who grade much more nicely. \nDO NOT take this class, this guy thinks that University Writing should be the focus of your life.. I don't know what is up with his expectations, but seriously, he should tone it down a little. We're not all professional writers that plan on taking creative writing classes...\nWorkload:\nRegular University Writing workload, but you have to read a book (it's a terrible book on photography, really boring and confusing).\n"
