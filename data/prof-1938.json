            "review_content": "\nErzen is great, although she comes off as really cold, it's just her manner, and she really cares a lot and wants to help you do well.  The class is an undertaking, with an outside project that requires tons of time, probably at least five or six hours a week outside class when all is said and done.  Lots of reading, but every bit of it is fascinating and you'll find yourself looking forward to it if you have the energy.  Lots of class discussion, so be sure you look like you know what you're talking about, at least, because the class is also usually tiny.  This is a great seminar for a religion major, or a sociology, or an urban studies - multidisciplinary.  You'll meet great people and your boundaries will be pushed, and although this class is really really stressful and you'll be asked to perform under pressure a lot, you'll be glad you did it afterwards. \nWorkload:\nLots of reading (~200 pgs/week), lots of discussion/attendance, occasional assignments to get you ready for ethnographic research, interviews, outside project fieldwork, final paper (20 pages) on outside project\n"
