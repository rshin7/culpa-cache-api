He's an amazing writer who explains stuff clearly without using the Bedford as a bible. Just be warned that he wants to be a lit hum teacher, and so all of the papers are on the lit hum books.\nWorkload:\nAbout 13 papers, inlcuding rewrites. Easy midterm and final. Everything is graded fairly, and he has no problem with giving you As and compliments if you deserve them. Overall, a good bet for a composition class.\n"
