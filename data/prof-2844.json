            "review_content": "\nLOVED this course, my favorite by far. He engaged the class in insightful discussion, and opened our minds to new and exciting literature. Those of us who had this class still talk about it.  Although Prof. Pettigrew was a visiting professor, it is hopeful that a position will open up so that he may teach full-time.  He is the kind of professor Columbia needs to hire.   \nWorkload:\nmanageable, but somewhat uneven.  Some weeks the readings will be very long and heavy, other weeks short and light.  weekly evaluations of the readings are required, inlcuding one in-class presentation, and a final 15-page paper\n"
