He tought the class with the knowledge that it was a requirement and that not everyone was a born-writer, but he was able to get people engaged and enjoy the class. He was a fair grader, and gave a much easier workload than most of the other sections.  He was very approachable and helpful both in and outside of class.  I highly recommend this teacher if you can get him.\nWorkload:\nSometimes there were weekly writing assignments, but these were never too much to handle.  He did assign the normal big papers that were required of the course but gives you plenty of time to do them.\n"
