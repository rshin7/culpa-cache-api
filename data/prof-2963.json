Unlike the majority of TAs, who simple don't care about you or the class, Josh wants you to learn the subject, and he will go to great lengths to see that you do. At the same time, if you are really stumped by a particular proof or problem (on which you can literally spend *hours* and get nowhere), he will take pity on you and walk you through the answer, so you can move on with your life/problem set.\n"
