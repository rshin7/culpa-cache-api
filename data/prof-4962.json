I started out going to every class - doing all the readings before class and taking thorough notes in class and discussion section. Then I realized class is completely pointless.... Reading the book and going to discussion section gets you an A. Discussion section was annoying. My TA was not familiar w the subject and basically prepared by reading the book. From the vibe I got, a lot of TA's were also TAing the class w/o any background in Egyptian history so everyone was kind of in the same boat and they couldn't answer questions. Also, the textbook (written by Professor Mieroop_ is all over the place (just like lecture) and its impossible to know what to focus on from the readings...the TA is incapable of prioritizing info... class is basically Professor Mieroop's random tangents. \nBust I will say its fairly easy to do well in the class. tests are random terms (there is choice) and a large essay question thats usually vague and you can kind of BS your way through.  To reiterate, this class was super disappointing for me - I went most of the semester doing all readings and participating to fullest extent just to realize it was a complete waste of time. Discussion sections are also super annoying bc there are pop quizzes made up of random terms that he never mentions in class and are mentioned literally once in an entire chapter of his book so you have no way of knowing what to focus on..I got an A in the class. \nWorkload:\n\nFinal examination (30% of total grade), Midterm + 2 research papers (45%), Participation in TA sections (3 pop quizzes, dropped lowest quiz) (25%)\n"

The lecture is just a longer, drawn out version. They are absolutely pointless. A new addition to the discussion sections are the spot checks (pop quizzes on readings). There is not set limit but there will be less if people do better.

He's incredibly knowledgeable about the material, his lectures are clear, straightforward, and focused, and he's also very enthusiastic about the material. If going to lecture every day isn't your thing, you also luck out because Van de Mieroop wrote the textbook for the class. So he doesn't cover anything in class that's not already in the textbook. It's a great Global Core class to fulfill requirements and you can avoid going to class and just reading the textbook if that's more your style. \nThe kicker comes with the discussion sections, which was a new addition to the class. Discussion sections basically go over various primary sources that were either briefly mentioned during lecture or have to do with the time period discussed in lecture. Part of your grade in the class depends on your participation in the discussion section, and that really depends on the TA you get. Personally, by TA was wonderful, a fairly easy grader, and was really enthusiastic about encouraging people to speak. But I also heard close friends with TA's who weren't helpful, were tough graders, and didn't help them in the class. Unfortunately, that's a toss up and you're just going to have to hope for the best with that. \nOverall, a really simple class, not much you have to worry about. My suggestion would be to talk to your TA and really get a sense of their teaching and grading style so you can ensure that A. \nWorkload:\n2 papers worth 15%, each around 5 pages\n15% midterm (ID's and an essay)\n25% discussion section participation (what this entails depends on your TA; for me, this included weekly discussion board posts and verbal participation during section)\n30% final (ID's, primary sources, and an essay)\nAgain, really easy to do well.

Most people never showed up to lecture since Van de Mieroop is really boring and drones on about inconsequential details of the lives of Egyptians. It was far from riveting.\nThough this was a 1000-level 3 credit class, it had a fair amount of work. It was perhaps Van de Mieroop's way of making the class harder to hurt everyone who took this thinking it was an easy A global core. We had to attend mandatory recitations with 3 pop quizzes, were actually forced to do the readings every week and submit a short write up about them online and lead the discussion for one recitation. It was an awful waste of time since the TA didn't really know much about Egypt nor did anyone really care.\nWe cover the whole shabang from origins of Egypt to the Greco-Roman period in excruciatingly boring detail. Everything he says in lecture is word-for-word in the textbook so a lot of people skipped it though you learn the things he focuses on in tests if you attend class. About 50-70 pages of light reading per week that you can skim through since it's just a rehash of class.\nYour grade entirely depends on your TA who manages everything for you. I took this thinking it was an easy A but somehow only got an A- even though it was total BS. Grading was harsh for a class that even the teaching team knew nobody cared about. If you need to take a Global core, there are probably better options with less work.\nWorkload:\n2 x 5-page papers - graded harshly for me\n1 midterm - it was ok (5 definitions and 1 essay)\n1 final - harder (5 definitions, 2 short essays on direct quotes from the text, 1 long essay)\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nMieroop is a wonderful lecturer. He is incredibly well versed in the history of ancient Egypt as he literally wrote the text book. The course is very well organized and the lectures are deliberately given. The external sources are carefully chosen and enrich the course. The course expectations are extremely straight forward: midterm, paper, final, which go 25/25/50. The midterm is surprisingly easy. Do not let this lull you into complacency between the midterm and the final! Be sure to spread the readings out throughout the semester as it is impossible to learn the detailed information that you will be tested on if you cram it into the reading period. Fortunately, Mieroop never assigns more than 20-30 minutes of reading per class so it is easy enough to keep up with the homework.\nThere is also a class field trip to the Met. Go! It is awesome. Mieroop points out relevant artwork (Amarna art etc) but more interestingly he points out his favorite pieces in the exhibit. This was definitely my favorite part of the whole course.\nAdditionally, towards the end of the course/in studying for the final do not worry so much about the Late Period or the Greco-Roman Period. Mieroop is more interested in the New Kingdom and will test you on that more than anything else in the final exam.\nI thought that this class could have used a discussion section due to its large size and sparse assignments, but I guess as the information is considered relatively straightforward there is not one.\nWorkload:\nMidterm - 25%\nPaper - 25%\nFinal - 50%\n"

            "review_content": "\nI took Professor Van de Mieroop's Ancient Near East class in Spring 2010. He and his TA, Nathaneal Shelley were both excellent. Prof VdM's lectures were definitely interesting if you read the chapter in advance. The TA could not have been more helpful. He stayed after class to answer questions, answered questions via email in a relatively prompt fashion and held TWO review sessions before the final exam. Grading was more than fair in my opinion. \nIf you are in it for the grade: You must read the chapters and the text analysis (1-3 page primary sources translated into english) before class. This amounts to ~50 pages of reading per week. If you read these and attend class, you'd be hard pressed not to get an A. If you are in it for the grades and do not care about expanding your knowledge base or are crushed for time, you do not need to read the secondary readings to do well in the class. There's a short (ours was 7 pages) paper as well. Given the subject matter assigned for the paper, I found 7 pages to be a breeze. \nIf you are in it for the joy of scholarly pursuit: Besides doing all the stuff in the \"for the grade\" section, key in on Prof. VdM's focus on sources and how they are used to interpret the history. His big kick is looking at sources with a critical eye and being careful to differentiate facts from theories about what actually occurred in the Ancient Near East. As the class progressed, you get more attuned to looking at what items were found, when they were found, who created them and what can be certified as fact, what can be speculated on and what can't be known about these distant time periods. I found this level of critical thinking pretty cool once you got the hang of it. \nOverall, I recommend this class and this professor. The workload is manageable, the professor is competent and effective in lecture and the grading is fair to slightly lenient. \nWorkload:\nThe work load was average. Weekly: (2) ~20 page chapters, (2) 1-3 page 'text analyses' plus (2) ~20 page secondary readings. This amounts to ~50 pages of reading per week. Other than some choice readings that are stressed heavily in class, you don't have to read all of the secondary readings to score well on the exams. \n"

If said student did attend class, he/she would have seen that Professor Van de Mieroop remained after his lectures ended to answer the lingering questions that students had.  The TA was also extremely helpful--he held two (optional) review sessions before the final exam, and would listen to and critique paper ideas.  In terms of not finding adequate English language source material for the paper, I did not seem to have that problem, and neither did any of the other people in the class who I spoke to.  In fact, on the paper assignment page, the professor provided a list of sources (all in the english language) that we could use.  Grading was also really, really fair, and probably more lenient than it should have been.  As long as you went to class, you didn't even have to study to get in the 90s on the midterm or final exam (I literally read through my class notes an hour before the final).  As far as not learning about how the wars were fought, if the student who wrote the post below me had gone to class, he/she would have learned 1) there is often not enough textual or archaeological evidence to provide details of every particular battle, and 2) when studying this period, it is more important to understand the overarching themes and causes and effects of events rather than get bogged down in detail.  In sum, the poster below me gave the totally wrong impression of the class.  \nWorkload:\nAssigned Readings (going to lecture and taking good notes is a complete substitute for this)\nMidterm (map, source analysis, essay)\n7 Page paper on figure from Ancient Near Eastern history\nFinal (source analysis, two essays)\n"

This made the class worthwhile because it was more laid back, you could afford to come a bit late, and class would often get out early. But life wasn\u00c2\u2019t peachy: every class he would find some particularly unlucky soul in the class and call on someone to regurgitate some chapter or part of a plot, presumably what he viewed as \u00c2\u2018engaging the class\u00c2\u2019. A few times he would spice it up by calling on a few other random kids for more insightful comments. Otherwise the class was usually dictated by the direction he wanted to follow and what he wanted to talk about in the reading. At times, he would try to \u00c2\u201cinvolve\u00c2\u201d students by asking them what they notice in a certain passage or excerpt (at which point the entire class falls into silence for half a minute and appears to read that passage). Then at the end of the class he often asks for questions, when some students might raise some issues. Whether it was the quality of the class or Mieroop\u00c2\u2019s flat and uninvolved responses to student inquiries, student discussion usually did not go greatly in depth. But it was not a torturous experience: Mieroop would talk about the general thematic elements or particular messages or facts he wanted to get across. In fact, if you value learning about the books in Lit Hum, then the class is perfectly enjoyable. But more troubling than his laid-back attitude (since it reaps as much good as bad) is his arbitrary grading. Sometimes it will make sense and seem fair, other times the format in which he grades is incomprehensible. His grading seems to involve a quick skimming of your work, and maybe a few interspersed (skin-deep) comments while leaving entire pages blank. Unless you get lucky with Mieroop\u00c2\u2019s grading, then it might very well leave you feeling upset if you put any thoughtful work into a paper / exam and wanted intelligent feedback. If you are desperate for a vivacious, constantly thoughtful, and engaging Lit Hum class, then skip Mieroop\u00c2\u2019s class. If you\u00c2\u2019re satisfied with a laid-back, often mundane, though somewhat thoughtful class, then stay with it.\n\nWorkload:\nWhen he has the chance to assign other reading, he usually will.

Very little is known about a good chunk of the time period he covers in class, leading to rambling lectures with no real content. 2. The course covers so long a time span that, once things do get interesting, it is impossible to study them in any depth. Whoever made the comment about only needing a 10-page notebook was right; he doesn't say enough concrete things for the first 10 weeks to even fill a single page a session. But this lack of content does not translate to easy exams. He said at the begninning of the semester that he didn't care about dates and thus rarely provided them in lectures. But this was a lie. Major sections of both the midterm and final were dependent on knowing the dates of certain dynasties, etc. In preparing for the final (having been screwed on the midterm), I found the textbook (though badly in need of some editing and written by Van de Mieroop) essential to figuring out when various things happened. The best part of the class, in terms of grading at least, was the paper. It involved the regurgitation of 10 pages of history on a particular city or civilization from the Oxford Ancient History and other books. It took some time, but involved basically zero thought.

            "review_content": "\nThe other person who reviewed Prof. Van de Mieroop was clearly one of the people who came into class and sat at the back of the room and talked during the lecture. Van de Mieroop is not only an extremely knowledgeable and famous scholar, but he has also acquired quite a following of students here at Columbia who will rearrange their schedules to be able to take a class with him... and rightfully so. Van de Mieroop's lecture style is very organized and he packs a lot of information into an hour and fifteen minutes. It is ALWAYS clear where he is going with what he is saying and it is always very interesting. The key to doing well is going to class; he does not test on the texts although reading the texts is always nice.\nWorkload:\nMidterm and final -- straightforward if you've attended every lecture. One 10-page research paper.\n"

            "review_content": "\nVan De Mieroop's lectures were inane and disorganized. His slow monotone either lulled you to sleep or to cut. If you do attend class, a crossword puzzle is a necessity and a ten page notebook will suffice. The course sapped me of my interest in ancient Egyptian history, leaving me with little more than a list of Pharaohs and the dates of their reigns. An easy class but not worth the frustration of such boredom.\nWorkload:\nA very short paper on an object in the Met, a midterm, and a final. Memorization a must, insight is useless.\n"
