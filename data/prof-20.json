It is obvious he is very well-read, has his own perspective on each of the others. After an introduction, he usually asks for our opinions. Most people haven't read the material or don't know what to say about it, and Billows doesn't mind continuing talking by himself.\nWe spend most of the class debating a lot of contemporary issues. So if that's problem for anyone, this isn't the class for you then. However, Billows is able to tie back those issues to the text, and draw some interesting conclusions. I have probably put in zero work (besides essays), but I've walked away learning something substantial.\nHe takes forever to hand back assignments, but its not that big of a deal.\nGrading: Overall, he seems relatively simple. Just agree with what he says in class, and you can't do too poorly.\nWorkload:\nTwo Essays-he comes up with the topic on the spot, everyone writes on the same topic. (you can tell he cares A LOT about this class)\nMidterm-THE AUTHOR NAME IS GIVEN FOR YOU!\nFinal-hoping for the same format as the midterm\n"

Each class Billows writes about 20 terms on the board, talks about each one, then crosses them off as he goes. Sometimes he uses pictures or maps, but, for the most part, he just stands there and talks. A lot. Many times to the point where he goes way over the lecture period time. Billows definitely grows on you, though, and it makes staying twenty minutes past the end of the lecture worth it. The class itself was an absolute breeze. The content was sometimes dry and seemingly pointless, and much of the exams was memorization and knowing major trends. Pretty much none of the readings have to be done. Even for the papers, facts from class and pulling tidbits from the required and recommending readings using the index were more than enough. Overall, an OK subject with a witty and knowledgable professor. \nWorkload:\nReadings that truly do not have to be done. A midterm (identifying about 10 terms, choice of an essay from a handful of prompts, as well as a map that is filled out at home and handed in with the exam), a final exam similar to the midterm but longer, and one 6-8 page paper. No surprises, completely fair questions, and graded fairly as well. \n"

A lot of the time he just lectured if we didn't have anything to say and he seemed perfectly fine with that.\nIf you do say something that he doesn't agree with, get ready to be promptly bitch-slapped and shut down.. Like even if his counterargument doesn't make sense he'll make it clear that your logic is wrong.\nHe has a soothing british accent that goes with his grandfatherly figure. \nHe swears in class. A lot. And references his nightly drinking habits. \nYeah I was like a big fan.\nI literally don't know the grade breakdown for this class cuz he didn't give us one lmfao. \nThere were points in the year when i was just like \"wait am I still in CC?\" and my science-major self was perfectly fine with that. \nAll in all fun class, 0 work, he doesn't teach second semester though so right now I'm scrambling to find another easy professor and it's not going too hot.. \n\nWorkload:\nReadings for each class that you absolutely don't actually have to do\n2 papers (6-8 pages each).. if you write your notes verbatim and agree with what he said in class you'll get an A.. I actually don't even think he really reads the papers hahahaa.\nA midterm and a final with passage IDs where he literally writes the name of the author after each passage (\"it's no fun for me to grade something you wrote about augustine when you're supposed to be writing about plato.\"), and essay questions. \n"

He covers the important stuff in class. He likes to go on asides, is pretty much interested in the military, and tends to say stuff that sounds horrible, but keep in mind, he's saying what the ancients thought, not what he thinks. He'll often point that out.\nHis IDs for his exams are always put on the board, so be sure to define them in lecture and start yourself a running spreadsheet of them from the start. You seriously won't have time to compile the kind of information needed on them when midterms roll around. There are also guaranteed to be a few that literally do not exist in the text book and were never mentioned in lecture. Have fun with that!\nBillows' TAs are a craps shoot. They are generally very nice, but will have no consistency whatsoever with regards to grading or expectation. Expect discussion to be a tangential waste of time, the paper to be graded harshly, and the midterm scoring to have no bearing on what they said to expect.\nAll that negativity aside, I liked his lectures well enough to take him twice in a row, TA tomfuckery notwithstanding. If you are even slightly interested in Ancient Greece or Rome, his class is sort of not to be missed.\nHe's liberal, goofy, and often gets lost down some weird(!!) roads. \nWorkload:\nRelatively heavy (dense, not so much lengthy) readings every week, with suggested reading totally unnecessary;\nMidterm: 5 ID definitions from list of 10 on exam, pulled from list of ~50 on a study guide + one short essay. Be prepared to write a LOT for the \"short\" IDs.\nFinal: 10 ID Definitions from a list of 20 on exam, pulled from a list of ~100 on a study guide, + 5 longer IDs, + 1 essay. \n1 term paper of 7-8 pages.\n"

It seems he actually enjoys teaching and sincerely cares about his students which, I believe, is not always the case of Columbia Professors. He is also a good lecturer and actually pretty funny, which can be useful as not everyone naturally gets excited about Ancient history.  \nThis Ancient Roman History course covered about 1000 years but Professor Billows did a great job structuring it. Just note that he particularly enjoys focusing on military history. Yet, he does make sure to cover all major topics but, as any lecturer, he focuses more on what he enjoys whenever possible.  \nI would definitely recommend taking this class. It will be a pleasure, you will come out with a good understanding of Roman history and especially a better idea of how to work with ancient primary sources.      \nWorkload:\nVery fair. A good amount of information to absorb as the course covers about 1000 years, but it's not bad at all so long as you attend and really pay attention during lectures. Otherwise, weekly readings with a particular emphasis on primary sources. One midterm worth 20% (definitions and one essay); one 6-8 page paper worth 40% (a primary source analyses); final is worth 30% (more definitions and one essay).

However, I don't think that, most of the time, he was actually voicing his own opinion. To me, it seemed as if he was just offering a challenge that we maybe had not thought about or that was commonly rejected in our times. However this meant that some of the things he said were a little scandalous. I think starting this class with the disclaimed that, \"I'm going to play Devil's Advocate, so don't be offended\" would be beneficial. \nThat said, I think he's a really nice guy. He's very grandfatherly in that he's kind of an old man who's set in his opinions and won't really budge. He does forget papers and midterms, but why should you complain?

            "review_content": "\nIn January 2011, on the Monday just before classes began, I received what I thought was quite a pleasant surprise: instead of the professor I had expected for Contemporary Civilizations, I would be enjoying a semester of instruction with a prominent scholar and historian. I thought myself the luckiest thing in Morningside.\nAfter the first class I mentioned to a friend that, whatever the hype, I hadn't found myself so much a fan of Billows's teaching style. Perhaps it would take some getting used to.\nThere was no \"getting-used-to.\" By the end of April, after each Monday and Wednesday I would have complained to anyone who would listen that *this* was the worst class to date, that Billows had outdone himself yet again. With the semester over, I can honestly say that CC with Billows was the most intellectually impoverished experience I had during my time at Columbia.\nBillows is forgetful and brusque, the archetype of a professor mellowed with tenure and cynical towards his undergraduates. He forgot our midterms in his house, car, or office for five weeks straight; \"My bag couldn't fit them all,\" he once complained. But this doddering quality softens him not an iota in day-to-day interaction: Billows possesses a robust set of lungs that he puts to great use in talking over students and cutting off people with whom he disagrees. I was shocked to see such a blatant disregard of basic classroom etiquette\u00e2\u20ac\u201din the instructor. \nAs if his disrespect towards the basic functioning of the class\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot to mention towards its participants\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwere not enough to poison the course, he persisted in making a caricature of himself as a professor of classical civilizations. Hardly a day went by without his throwing out the off-hand orientalist or sexist remark, and either pretending that he had meant it all in jest or that there was nothing offensive the comment whatsoever. He was dismissive of Wollstonecraft, Woolf, Fanon, and DuBois, treating the texts cynically, as if he believed they found inclusion on the syllabus solely for their authors' sex or race. If one were the sort of person to deride CC as necessarily canonizing, othering, and perpetuating of Western hegemony\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand I resolutely am not that sort of person\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthis would have been that exact sort of Plato-to-NATO class at which one would direct one's rage.\nBut most important was that his instruction was paltry at best, bankrupt at worst. We never cracked open the texts in class; not once did he call of us to turn to a particularly difficult or telling passage. Reading meant very little; close reading, nothing at all. Very often\u00e2\u20ac\u201das if we were not discussing the richest texts in the Western political and ethical tradition\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe would run out of things to say by the two hour mark, and sit there in gloomy silence. Did he, I still wonder, off any insights that couldn't be gleaned from skimming \"Sophie's World\"? Billows's grading had such a light touch as to be insulting; perhaps he maintained such a condescending attitude about our intelligence that he was continually surprised that any of his students could string a sentence together. This is fine if you are looking just to get your degree and have a shining transcript to accompany it, but much less fine if you came to Columbia looking for a profound and challenging education marked by the Core. By the end of the semester, even principled students were pulling out their computers in class to read the New York Times and work on things that actually mattered. \nIf this fellow shows up on your schedule, run.\nWorkload:\nTwo six- to eight-page papers, midterm, final. You hardly have to read the books, or even be able to.\n"

Accept that in a lecture he's going to tell you the same stories over and over again, not make any real attempt to engage his students, and go 10-15 minutes over every class. If you are interested in Greek history, all of this is worth it. He knows his stuff, tells it in a very entertaining manner, and generally is a very lenient grader.\nIn the seminar I took with him, he had between 1-3 students present on the week's readings. Often times, Billows intentionally gave us arguments to read that he did not agree with, precisely so he could counter their claims in class. If you were not presenting (You have to present twice throughout the year), you basically just sat there and listened for 1:50 a week. At the end of the semester a 20 page paper was due. If you take a Billows seminar and it is in this format, I would recommend that you get a vague idea of what you want to write about in the beginning of the semester. Then you can sign up to present on that topic in class, use your research from your presentation to  write most of your paper, and just find additional details to fill in the rest. You literally have to do no work otherwise outside of showing up (almost) every week. \nWorkload:\nIntro Greek- midterm and final with IDs given plus essays. 6-8 page paper\nAPT - 12 page paper plus take home final\nGreek invention of history- 20 pager at the end\n"

            "review_content": "\nAfter taking this course, I'm firmly convinced that Billows received his education in the Spartan \"agoge\" and eats lunch with his \"syssitia\" every day. This guy loves everything Ancient Greece, and he certainly loves to discuss every detail of a \"hoplon\" shield and the tactical formations of a Macedonian phalanx, and how the Macedonians kept Persian cavalry charges at bay with their \"sarissa\" long pike.\nAs you can imagine, this class is mindnumbingly boring, especially at 10:30 in the morning. Basically class is structured around Billows writing 20 terms on the blackboard, and then he gives a lecture where he goes over all the terms, and underlines each and every one as he covers it. It's basically a long stream of dates and people, and its just gets to be pretty unbearable after awhile. \nClass goes over by at least 15 minutes every day, which really got on my nerves.\nThe thing is...despite the fact that the class is boring, it's SO EASY TO DO WELL. I mean, the pragmatic person (Pericles was the archetypal pragmatist, Billows emphasizes) would suffer in the short term to benefit in the long run. When it comes to the midterm and final, Billows gives you a list of like 120 terms, which is basically miserable to go through each and every term, but if you want to do well, just suffer and go through them all and write up some notecards.\nDespite suffering, it's not hard to get an A in the class. Mike was an excellent TA, probably because he didn't know anything about Ancient Greece. We talked more about historiography and how to read ancient texts and what information we can glean from texts like Herodotus and Thucydides.\nHere's some tips: go to section, don't go to lecture all the time, meet with your TA about the paper, READ FREEMAN'S Greek Achievement, read the LitHum sections of Herodotus, read the Melian Dialogue from Thucydides, read Robert Kagan's Peloponnesian War (quick read), don't even buy Plutarch or Polybius. \nYou can do it. Trust me. \n\nWorkload:\nMidterm, finals, term sheets for midterm and final, and do the tips I said above.\n"

I enjoyed going to class almost every time as we often discussed hot button topics in relation to the readings, and the class would frequently get into debates. Moreover, we tended to focus on the main points of readings rather than the details/quotations. This was, in my opinion, very enjoyable because it allowed me to come away with an overall understanding of the works. However, it also meant that we did a bit of a \"surface study of the works. \nThat being said, one issue I had with Billows is that he was very inaccessible. He made it clear that he did not want us coming to his office hours. Also, I feel that at times we could have kept closer to the work and not gotten into as many contemporary debates. Finally, he ONLY teaches first semester (and has done so for something like 20 years -- he's an ancients professor), which to me was a bit of an issue. Overall, though, a very enjoyable CC experience. \nWorkload:\nNot bad. Only two papers, graded very leniently. Midterm with fourish quotation IDs (author given to us and we had choice) and an essay and final with fivish IDs (again, author given and we had a lot of choice) and two essays.

So long as you come to class for the lecture notes and read Greek Achievement, the main text around which this class is centered, you should be prepared for the exams.

Billows centers his discussions around broad topics and not around specific quotes.  This alows for really interesting debate and also means that the books do not have to be carefully read.

But other than that, I really enjoyed Professor Billows class.  He is, as other reviews say, a old school professor.  He lectures straight for an hour and a half and is likewise always rather thrown off when someone asks him a question in the middle of his lecture.  He has a dry sense of humor that can spice up the lectures, and his building excitement when he talks about war is quite entertaining.  I knew very little about greek history before taking this class, and although I did not have much of an interest in the subject, I found the class really enjoyable. The lectures were for the most part very interesting.  Definitely recommended.\nWorkload:\nmedium. a text book that follows the class lectures very closely and several primary texts that are not entirely necessary (but do give good extra information). midterm with ID's, take home map, and essay and final with ID's, short answer, and essays.  before each exam he gives out a list of terms that are really helpful in review/studying.  there is also a 6-8 page paper in the middle of the semester, which requires some research but is overall not that bad.  everything is graded pretty generously, and billows has some form of a curve that he puts on the class at the end as well.\n"

If you want a professor who focuses on main themes, connections to current events, historical context, etc. you would probably like this section, but if you want to analyze specific quotes in detail and are bothered by students who make uninsightful comments, you probably would not like this section.  To me, the class felt like he was teaching more in the style of a history or political science class than in the style of an English class, so think about which style you like better.\nWorkload:\nstandard reading amount.  You could get away without doing all of it.  The exams had a number of options and we just had to explain already-identified quotes for the ID sections.  The essay topics were somewhat ambiguous, which at first was many students found confusing, but this was to allow you to interpret the question in a way of interest to you.  We did not have choices for the essay questions, but they were general enough that I didn't think choices were necessary.\n"

He gives lengthy backgrounds before starting each book which can be a little slow, but I liked how he put everything into context. He has no problem shooting down students, forcing them to argue their points of view, which may not be good for sensitive people. Sometimes the class was unbearably long, especially if only a few people read, but he doesn't give pop quizzes or anything, and he doesn't seem to care either way, but things go much better when more people read the books. Throughout the semester, I grew to appreciate him more and more since he really just discusses the book and doesn't make students do postings or responses or anything else.\nWorkload:\n2 papers, 1 midterm, final.

Doing the reading is helpful but not wholly necessesary since his lectures are really thorough.  Be prepared to take lots of detailed notes because he rattles of dates and names about as fast as you can write them once he gets going.  His impersonations of various historical figures are real gems.  The downside to his class (excluding the lecture length) is that he is not very approachable.  Especially concerning papers, his responses to questions often bear little resemblance to the question asked.  He grades fairly (not too hard but he will call bs what is is).  His terms lists make studying for the midterm and final really easy (but be prepared to study a lot).\nWorkload:\nLong reading assignments which you should do but can do at your own pace.  Midterm; 5-7 page term paper (topics given) and a final (about 2hrs.)\n"

I heard he is an easy grader and he probably is, I did very well on the midterm, but it is annoying to memorize and study for the million IDs.  If you want an interesting course with a pretty lenient professor, take this one. \nOne thing I found annoying were the recitations.

Prof. Billows takes his lectures almost straight from the textbook, so if you miss a class or skip a reading it's not the end of the world.  The lectures could get kinda dry sometimes, but make sure you pay attention when Billows talks about Athens; it is his specialty, and it can actually be pretty funny to observe his obvious bias against all other greek cities.  He has a really dry sense of humor, but you might miss his jokes and sarcastic remarks if you don't pay attention. He doesn't like to be interrupted when lecturing, so prepare to be shot down when you offer comments or questions, especially if you say something uncomplimentary to the Athenians.  The worst part of the course was that he honestly went at least 10 minutes overtime for EVERY SINGLE CLASS. Overall, an interesting course with a relatively light workload, and taught by a professor who definitely knows his subject. \nWorkload:\nmidterm with take-home map section, 1 paper (graded easily), final\n"

He only teaches the first semester, so expect a mystery professor for second semester.\nLectures are opened with history lessons, all which are pertinent and interesting, if you can bear to listen.  See, he talks in this kind of monotonous drone with a British accent, which makes you a bit sleepy.  It doesn't help that he rocks back and forth in his chair the whole two hours, lulling you with this rhythmic motion.  But he has good stuff to say, can rescue floundering discussions, and always makes excellent points about the readings.  Discussions sometimes go off on tangents, but he seems fine with it as long as it's something everyone is interested in discussing.  You'll come away with a good understanding of the works.\nHe brings up 'controversial' issues regarding the Bible, so if this is sacriligious and insulting to you, don't take the class and get your underwear all bunched up.  Come to class with an open mind and willingness to talk, and you'll have a rewarding experience.\nWorkload:\nNormal load of readings (he even told us a reading was too long so just _skim_ oncce), ONLY TWO ESSAYS of 6-8 pgs, midterm and final (no ID's), all graded very generously.\nNote:  Professor Billows apparently has no quantitative grading system, but instead gives you letter grades for 2 essays, midterm, final, and class participation, then sits down and looks at them.  He decides your grade individually based on these grades, and probably his personal opinion of you.  He admits it's subjective, but hey, he's lenient enough that it shouldn't matter.\n"

His historical accounts did get a little boring, but they only last a little bit of the class; the majority of the time is spent trying desperately to answer his important yet highly-philosophical questions that really require a quick mind and a broad understanding of the material.  Even days when it was clear no one had read, he could get the class riled up.  Some may say that he shoots down people, which is kind of true, but he makes sure to simply point out the holes of the many stupid arguments that may come up.  This keeps discussions on target, focused, and engaging.  CC is not hard, but Billows defintiely asks the tough questions and genuinely wants people to think about their responses.  A good choice for the class.  \nWorkload:\n2 (YES, ONLY 2!!!) papers, fairly easy, suprisingly difficult mideterm and final \n"

Then comes the discussion, which, like all CC classes, depends heavily on what type of people you have in your clas. Don't let him intimidate you, cause when he thinks you're wrong he definitely lets you know. At the same time, he does make an effort to encourage class discussion, and allows the dialogue to go on long, strange and often humorous tangents that are in some way apparently related to the text. One thing you will get out of this class is a good understanding of the texts, which can't be said for every CC class. Billows is humorous and pretty entertaining, I really enjoyed both the style and structure of his class.

You also pick up knowledge of the Ptolemies and war elephants, as this was the topic of his thesis. To girls: he is cute. Very cute.
