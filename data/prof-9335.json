His recitation sessions are for those who wish to have a deep and complete understanding of E+M. Also, he does more examples than the professor does in class, which also helps with learning how to approach certain problems. If you have him, be thankful because not many TA's are in the mood to help undergrads...\nWorkload:\nN/A\n"
