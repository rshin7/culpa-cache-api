            "review_content": "\nA professor at the law school, Witt is the first professor I've had that has had his own personal assistant. He's very enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and engaging professor who really knows what he's doing. However, sometimes the lectures don't connect to the readings, which are ridiculously long and nearly impossible to finish each week. Not only does Witt cover general shifts in legal history, he also focuses on individuals whose legal theories have influenced the course of law. I would definitely recommend creating a study group for the final to split up outlines for each week. I was annoyed that the guidelines for the final were pretty vague and some others became frustrated with the class, but if you put in time and effort, an A- is within reach. \nWorkload:\nHeavy reading; one book per week with a focus on a few key cases. Discussion (15%),One short paper 5-7 pages (15%), one longer paper 8-10 (35%), and a final that focuses on the themes of the class (35%). \n"
