If not, then you probably shouldn't take the class.  Bernie will rip your game to shreds and show you all the problems with and holes in your design.  That said, the class is great for those who are excited about designing and building a game with only a little outside direction.  (Keep in mind that it doesn't have to be a *video* game.  It can be a board game, a card game, or any other kind of game you can design.  No coding experience or knowledge required!) I would strongly recommend this class, but not to the faint of heart.\nWorkload:\na lot of written work (which was never graded or returned to us...), a semester long project (your game...)\n"

You'll know on the first day whether you want to stay in the class, because it's sort of a big arrogant meritocracy. Highs and lows.\nWorkload:\nA lot of written work, most of which isn't very productive. Also you have to code a video game from scratch; that takes just an eensy bit of time.\n"
