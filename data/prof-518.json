He is by far one of the most insane, energetic, and entertaining people I have ever met. He bounces around the classroom, nibbles on chalk, throws things, and goes on tangents that are not always politically correct, making for a classroom experience that is never, ever boring. \nAs for actually learning French, I found him to be a very effective instructor. While it's certainly important to learn French from native speakers at one point, it's also really helpful to have an instructor who was once in your shoes. Vincent really understands the challenges of learning French and is able to elucidate things that English speakers find to be particularly difficult. He's also crazily prompt about returning things quickly and with a lot of helpful feedback. \nIf you have the option of taking a class with Vincent, do it. It will be the most enjoyable class you take that semester, if not ever. \nWorkload:\nLots of writing, some reading, occasional verb conjugation quizzes, a couple tests\n"

Everyone should take his class if given the chance. \nI'm going to skip about writing on his amazing personality and positive energy since the reviews below have all talked extensively about these topics.\nHe is not only a great and fun person, but a GREAT PROFESSOR. He teaches the grammar concepts very clearly and he has summarized rules for grammars that are usually ten times better than how the book presents it. Go to his lectures and learn from him!!!! French grammar is difficult but he really makes it as fun as it could be. \nHis tests are not difficult and they really test how much you know the concepts/have studied. He's a pretty lenient grader, and you can tell he really wants you to learn instead of take off tons of points on tests for stupid little details.\nTAKE HIS CLASS!!!! You won't regret it.\n\nWorkload:\nvery manageable. no quizzes, just 4 tests, daily homework, some online. He rarely collects homework so it's for your own sake to do them. 5 compositions. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI would like this to be the review that gets Vincent his well-deserved gold nugget. The fact that he does not yet have one is the cruelest crime against humanity as far as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m concerned. If I had to list the greatest crimes against humanity, it would go Vincent's lack of a gold nugget on Culpa, genocide, Fox news. \nVincent is quirky. Zooey Deschanel quirky, and just as lovable, perhaps more so. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never before seen a man put chalk in his mouth. Vincent smokes like a Frenchman (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let him fool you, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from New Jersey), and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m fairly certain that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so desperate for a cigarette during class he rolls the chalk between his lips and pretends. That is, until, spontaneously, Vincent is struck with the need to scrawl someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name on the wall. The wall. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m certain if you look carefully in Hamilton 302, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see lots of white chalk on the white walls. Jake. Jake. JAKE! Jake. Then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the pacing. Vincent is like a preacher on ecstasy. He walks up and down and around the classroom constantly, flailing his arms around. So when I say you won't fall asleep, you can believe me. \nVincent is screwed up, and he loves this about himself. You will too. For instance, when we would practice verb tenses in class, he would write lengthy pieces himself for us to play around with. In class we would read aloud and change all the verb tenses of a piece describing how a sexual experience came about from some Greco-Roman wrestling between two men. This is both funny and super helpful. Though many might like to have five minutes to think about how to change a certain verb into a certain tense, obviously you have to be able to do that at the drop of a dime. Vincent insists on it with exercises like this. \nVincent loves synonyms, and your vocabulary will improve immensely because of this. He also goes over vocab in class, which really helps you to remember it. I swear, I remember \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accrocher\u00e2\u20ac\u009d because I can picture Vincent hanging a jacket on the door; I remember \u00e2\u20ac\u0153au fond de\u00e2\u20ac\u009d because I can see Vincent scavenging for something at the bottom of his backpack. By the end of this class you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have an enormously improved vocabulary, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll especially know lots of synonyms for words like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to take\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to smash.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Your writing will become more descriptive and more interesting because, all of a sudden, you know the word for hemorrhoid, for sledgehammer, for sparkle! The words you used to avoid are suddenly at your fingertips.  \nThe part you probably care about now: grading. Vincent grades quickly and effectively. Every mistake is underlined and explained. And you can always turn in a revision for a re-grade of an A if you correct everything. \nVincent is a boss, a pimp, a Frenchman. I'd like to offer some final, short anecdotes to convince you of this.\nWhen I pestered him to quit smoking, he started to offer me cigarettes. \nHe once emailed the entire class because he wanted to add new music to his iPod and he wanted suggestions.\nHe taught us how to pirate music from youtube in class. \nIn fact, Vincent is a big fan of youtube videos in class. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What?! You haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen this?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Immediately it becomes necessary to watch some video. \nI will close this with a request. Please do NOT take Vincent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s class, because if you do and I have a crappy registration period, I might not get into the class. So piss off. \n\nWorkload:\n4 essays, occasional tests, vocab quizzes, an oral presentation, a midterm, a final, nightly homework. Really not that hard to manage, and Vincent's fine about extensions. \n"

            "review_content": "\nHaving recently finished undergrad, this is the second, and last review I will write about a professor at Columbia. I am thrilled to say that this will be in stark contrast to my first review, which was more of a scathing critique, really. Vincent Aurora is the single best professor I have had the fantastic fortune of encountering at this school. I was not looking forward to an accelerated french class, 4 times a week for 2 hours every day. Needless to say, I was only taking it in order to fulfill a requirement. What I discovered in that classroom was, however, what most students dream of finding at college. He was the single most enthusiastic, energetic, hilarious, witty, thought provoking and absolutely engaging professor I have ever had. There simply aren't any negative things I could say about him or the class. Be prepared to work a little more than you expect to, try to be moderately prepared for class, but other than that, you're gold. A colour I am shocked he has yet to be designated. \nIf you get a chance, I implore you, no, I *beseech* you, to take a class with this man. I don't believe that there is someone else out there who could teach a language with as much natural fluidity than this person. He is genuine and reasonable and his anecdotes keep you as focused as you'd be if you were having a bit of a chat with your friend. I learned more french than I ever thought was possible, because frankly speaking, I am the farthest thing from a language person. What struck me the most about him was that he seriously cared about teaching his students things. French, obviously, but all sorts of other things, general knowledge things, Europe things, pop music things, political scandal things, history things, really just everything. And I don't know what this rubbish is about his sense of humour being sharp edged. He has the exact sense of humour I look for in my friends - he is downright hilarious. \nTake my word for it, his class is just something you need to try before leaving this school. Sit in on a lecture or two and you'll see what I mean. \nWorkload:\nStandard language workbook + oral exercises every week, some mini essays that he lets you edit as much as you like, completely reasonable tests throughout the semester.\n"

(But also maybe not for the uptight, easily offended, super PC students I know lurk around here. His sense of humor can be umm graphic and ummm violent.)\nI found myself so inspired by the class that I would print out vocab we went over in class that we didn't have to learn for quizzes/tests/whathaveyou and learning it on my own time when I should've been reading for lit hum. \nVincent is inspiring and funny and someone I would want to go drinking with one day when I'm 21 and can finally drink. This sounds very ramble-y because frankly I'm just in awe of Vincent. \nOh but he's from New Jersey. Ick. \nWorkload:\nLots of homework but it's not overwhelming, three essays that you can revise for up to an A, a midterm and a final.

He always tried to spark the interest of every person in the room, and he knows so much about modern French culture. \nThe best part is that since he is American, he understands the difficulty Americans have in learning French, unlike other French professors that are French. \nI learned more French in this class than I did in 2 years of French with other teachers. Also he actually taught us about current politics and events in France, unlike other professors who usually just go off the culturelle section in the textbook, which is usually outdated/irrelevant. \n\nWorkload:\nThere is quite a lot of reading and listening, and the class moves VERY QUICKLY.

            "review_content": "\nI've realized that class taught by Vincent can feel like nothing, especially after reading the last review.\nSo, if you are:\n1. a person who doesn't believe in having fun when you're in class, and feels class time should be solely devoted to learning words that you think are \"useful\", \n2. a person who can't take jokes and gets easily offended, or,\n3. a person who thinks you're always right and others are always wrong.\nI suggest you get a Rosetta Stone and a good English-French dictionary. You can save so much money and learn French!\nVincent talks a lot about his own experience in France. Most of them are funny, and I'm guessing most of his students took it as a cultural experience. If you don't, see number 1 from above.\nAlso, he makes fun of his students. They're usually quite silly. But it's not like he's going to attack you viciously, making fun of your appearance or stuff like that. He's extremely witty; his comebacks are hilarious and smart. But again, if you find silly jokes offensive, see number 2.\nLastly, like us, Vincent has his own opinions, and he's open to voice his own. Some can be strong. So if you're a zealot and think you can lead Vincent to martyrdom, please reconsider and check back at number 3.\nHowever, the vast majority of the students will find this class extremely enjoyable. Let's face it. Without having some fun, the 2 hour meeting for 4 days a week can be torturous. While having fun, Vincent is so effective that we still go through all the materials that we were supposed to cover for a given day. Also, he's a lenient grader, and his due dates for essays and exercises are flexible. Because he's American, he knows what's hard for us. So his explanations are very clear.\nAlthough learning French is the primary goal of this class, I think it's important to get rid of the fear of speaking French; and Vincent does an excellent job of that. I really wish I had him earlier so I could've majored in French.\nSo, if you do have a chance to take his class, DO SO. It will give you eternal happiness, unless you fall into one of the three categories; then you should go get the Rosetta Stone ASAP.\nWorkload:\nFor a 8 point course, not so much.\nI've heard 2.5 point Chinese class has more workload than this.\n5 exams, 10 exercises(oral+written), occasional redactions, and occasional readings. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI usually don't write culpa reviews but I was inspired the recent negative one of professor Aurora. Although there were aspects of 3406 that I didn't like, I understood their purpose. Writing creative pieces that require you to learn vocab like \"se herisser\" or \"avec fracas\" can be frustrating and seem pointless when you are doing it, especially if you really just want to focus on your analytical writing, but Aurora knows what he is doing. I am a much better writer and reader--in all respects--because of his insistence on things like obscure vocabulary.\nAs to his cruelty, he can be a bit biting at times, but I wouldn't say that he was ever cruel. In fact, as a teacher I found him to be refreshingly considerate. He graded everything promptly, returning it to the students by the next class and his policy that everything can be edited and rewritten until it is an A is immensely generous. Yes, this means pretty much everyone gets an A but it was also one of the single most successful ways of teaching writing--no matter what language--that I have ever encountered since it forces you to actually read all those corrections teachers make and finally look up whether a certain word is masculine or feminine or if a certain construction takes the subjunctive or not. This teaching method alone--which added enormous amounts of extra work for him--convinced me that not only is he a great teacher, but he is someone who cares about his students both academically and personally. \nI agree that he is a bit of a gossip but he never said anything worse about his peers than I've heard students say about their professors or their peers. And I actually took most of the comments he made about the other professors as an informal guide on \"who's class not to take.\" \nWorkload:\nMassive amounts of writing, most of which are more creative than analytical. Depending on if you are good at creative writing will determine the amount of time required for the homework. I really struggle with creative writing, even in English, so the workload was intense for me\n"

            "review_content": "\nNo doubt that Mr. Aurora is a charismatic man who knows how to inspire his students to learn French and to make them feel what seems like their French improved. I didn't feel I learned a whole lot. I felt that during that class Mr. Aurora taught us things, vocabulary especially, that are necessary for someone to write novels rather than to use in real life. Why on earth do people in their third year of French, who can't even speak it properly who still are in a dire need of mastering intermediate grammar models, need to know words like \"se h\u00c3\u00a9risser\" - to bristle, or \"avec fracas\" - very loudly, with a lot of noise. Seems totally useless to me. As if Mr Aurora is more interested to teach what interests him, not what the students need. It seemed like he only wanted to show off and demonstrate what he knows to us rather than to make sure that we retained the information. I'm tired of all the raves on this site about him, because everyone loves to be entertained, but if they looked at what they learned in class, I don't think there would be much. \nHe can also be pretty cruel in his remarks, and he does says horrible things behind other professors' and students' backs and he boasts that he knows human psychology well and knows how to use it to manipulate people. It's like the guy has no conscience, and if you do get on the wrong side of him, he will make your life hell and will enjoy it. I got an A in his class and am writing this not because I'm bitter, but because of what I saw in class and it was quite disturbing. I don't like him at all and I wouldn't recommend this class or any class with this lecturer.   \nThe easy grading also seems to be a result of not wanting to get too involved in the whole teaching thing. \nWorkload:\nit's pretty decent, and although reading passages are short, he gives lots and lots of written homework. \n"

Vincent does get a reputation as an easy grader, but facts are, he just makes you work your ass off for your inflation, and you will enjoy it. \nFurthermore, unlike the rest of the language instruction establishment, Vincent will let you go out on a limb and take risks with French, without punishing you for making the effort. If you study with him, make sure to experiment\n\u00c2\u2014you will get far more out of the course that way, as he will be willing to explain esoteric grammatical structures, jargon, and colloqualisms.\nIf you love French as a language, per se, or any language for itself, you owe it to yourself at least to sit in on Vincent's classes.\nWorkload:\nAs many short essays as Vincent has time to grade (typically one per week), starting out with half-pages and moving on up to a two-page argumentation. Almost everything can (and should) be edited and turned in a week after you have your first copy in hand. Many exercises in grammar and style, with some translation, due in preparation for class, daily, or a short reading to read closely and take down thoughts for discussion.\n"

As others have already written, he is very funny and enthusiastic and a little bit crazy - a lot of fun in a conversation class.  He's far and away better than most of the adjuncts or French students here for a year who usually teach these classes.  I learned a lot and for the first time felt truly engaged in a French class.  Take this class or whatever class you can with Vincent, he's phenomenal.\nWorkload:\nHarder than some other conversation classes: vocab quizes every other week, pronounciation tests using poems (that you don't have to memorize) and several essays, plus one brief oral presentation on French news articles.

There's SO much work involved - busywork from that Grevisse book, and writing assignments every week, if not practically every class (or so it seemed at times).

These 4 months did more than 4 years of high school (7-10th grade) French classes did. Classes are highly entertaining; I don't believe I skipped a single one at all; Vincent performs for his students -- but it's all secondary to making French grammar interesting and teaching things like the subjunctive tense extremely well. And as if all this isn't enough. did I mention that he's an easy grader?? A classmate said that it was the exact opposite of L&R; in that your essays would come back with red marks all over them pointing out the errors in your sentence construction and then end by giving you an A. I easily spent at least 3 hours on every essay assigned, and he rewards the effort put into it. oh, if anyone's interested, he also speaks Italian and Latin fluently. Wish I could do that.

Biweekly essays (the writing of which do a lot for your command of written French), absolutely no busywork (fill-in-the-blanks exercises) like in other language classes. Readings every weekend (which can be hard), but Vincent picks the best readings out of a mixed lot in the assigned text. We read some solid authors - Camus, Duras, Voltaire - not bad for an intro language class. Midterm was a joke. Final was fiendish but Vincent invigilating helped a lot - no time limit, *and* he fed hungry students. The man is, simply put, a god.\n"

            "review_content": "\nVincent it definitely cool - after having suffered through the language requirement, I questioned my sanity when I decided to subject myself (voluntarily, no less) to yet another french course. However, Vincent makes the class truly fun - he's animated, funny, and really seems to care about how much his students are enjoying themselves. He really throws himself into his teaching, and is extremely animated - he looks and sounds like a french speaking Hank Azaria. Perhaps the only criticism I have for his section is that the workload is by no means light - well, for a french class that is, which isn't saying much i guess - with vocab quizes, midterm, presentations, short papers and journal entries. However, grading is fair and easy, and some of the work feels like a mere formality. Even if you do more work than other sections, it won't come close to your workload in other classes, and it's worth it to be taught by Vincent. I highly recommend this course. \nWorkload:\nmedium: several (ungraded) one page \"journal entries\" on any subject you like, several 1-2 pg papers on predetermined topics, several (really easy) vocab quizes, midterm (easy), short in-class presentations.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAbsolutely the best French teacher out there. He is as entertaining as they come, as well. If you are just doing French to get rid of your language requirement, Vincent is nice and he'll make you enjoy yourself. If you're taking the course to major in something related, he's a great resource to learn what the French actually say, rather than the 1950's type dialogue in text books. If you can, take this course.\nWorkload:\nGrading is fair. Do the work, and you'll do well. Bi-weekly compositions and bi-weekly vocab tests, nothing you can't handle.\n"

Department-wide mid-term and final are both very simple for anyone w/ a reasonable understanding of grammar. In all, it's a good class to take to fulfill the language requirement.\nWorkload:\nshort papers every few weeks, weekly quizzes, a bit of reading and grammer... mid-term, final... The workload was heavy at first but seemed to tail off as the semester progressed.\n"

He is upbeat and very refreshing specially if it is a morning class. It is not possible to fall a sleep in his class.
