She manages to make everything tediously boring, in addition she tends to jump from one topic to another. However, the most annoying part was how unapproachable and unaccommodating she is to students...don't even bother visiting her during her office. And I just have to say, for a class of 20 students she REALLY doesn't need a TA grading everything!!!!\nDo yourself a favor and stay away from this class/this professor!!!!!!!!\nWorkload:\nin class quizzes, 3 papers (4-5 page), class participation, blog posts on Courseworks, take-home final\n"
