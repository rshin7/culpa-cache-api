            "review_content": "\nJeffrey was my TA for Modern Political Thought with Melissa Schwartzberg and let's just say I looked forward to his weekly TA sessions much more than class!  He is by far the best ta I've ever had in a political science class at Columbia (and I've had a lot...it's my major).  He's extremely clear, articulate, organized, logical, and quick.  He doesn't lecture just to hear the sound of his own voice and actually answers questions/clarifies material.  Jeffrey doesn't waste his time...or yours.  It certainly doesn't hurt that he's also super cute and funny.  One warning is that he is not an easy grader - but I think he is ultimately fair.  I hope he gets to teach CC one day!  The material we covered for this class was basically identical to the CC syllabus.  \nWorkload:\nclass once a week, a lot of reading (skimming...), 1 midterm essay, 1 final essay (both take home) - not as difficult as Melissa makes it sound on the first day of class!\n"
