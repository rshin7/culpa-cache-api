            "review_content": "\nRTM is a ridiculously great teacher.  The following is a letter of recommendation that originally went elsewhere, but I thought it should be posted on Culpa, as well.\nRobert Miller\u00c2\u2019s passion for learning and concern for the well being of his students are exceptional and obvious.  He sends us mass emails inviting us to relevant lectures, plays, or films; after every class, he gives us additional information and lecture notes; his commentary on graded papers is nearly as long as the paper itself.   Next week, our class is screening the film of Pride and Prejudice because one student mentioned that she owns it, and he insisted that we set up a time for the whole class to enjoy it.  Mr. Miller cares for his students so much that he wants us to be better people; this quality is what makes him a truly great teacher.\nVery few teachers dare to do what Robert Miller does: instruct us on how to live our lives as good people.  Using each work on the syllabus as support for his overall purpose, which is to teach us how to live, Mr. Miller presents us with a constant theme throughout both semesters.  The lectures for each work are airtight, and the arguments he presents us with for each text connect to the overarching theme of the class.  A week or two ago, we read Shakespeare\u00c2\u2019s King Lear.  I had previously been taught that Shakespeare was a master of the English language, and that is why he is considered great; thus, I read King Lear in this light, and I enjoyed it without giving a thought to the greater idea of \u00c2\u201cthe good life.\u00c2\u201d  I should have realized that Mr. Miller always has a deeper reading, and this time it turned out no differently.  During the two-hour lecture, Mr. Miller pointed out each incidence where a character was referred to as a \u00c2\u201cfool\u00c2\u201d and structured the lecture around these incidences.  In this time, the class discussed the plot and analyzed the characters, just as the other Literature Humanities sections undoubtedly did; we covered the basics.  There was also another level of reading that the other classes did not discuss.  Mr. Miller connected each incident when a character was labeled as a fool and drew parallels between these characters.  They were all \u00c2\u201cgood,\u00c2\u201d and the label of \u00c2\u201cfool\u00c2\u201d took on a new meaning, introducing a further discussion of \u00c2\u201cthe good life.\u00c2\u201d  The lecture was clearly well planned, and Mr. Miller magnified one of Shakespeare\u00c2\u2019s subtle points so that we could consider and understand the deeper meaning.  And King Lear is just one of the works we\u00c2\u2019ve covered throughout the year, all taught in the same detailed manner.\nOne may argue that a one-sided presentation of how to live one\u00c2\u2019s life is unfair to the students.  But Mr. Miller treats us as mature adults who can judge the value of a teacher\u00c2\u2019s argument.  I can only wish that everyone would have teachers with such strong convictions, such passion, and such intelligence as Robert Miller.\n\nWorkload:\n2 papers a semester, no midterm, final he takes with a large grain of salt.  The papers, though, are much longer and more in-depth than the other LItHum classes.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI switched into Miller\u00c2\u2019s lit hum class in the middle of the year, so I can write a bit about what it is that makes Miller so different and compels his students to write the longest, most gushing reviews you can find on CULPA.  The first instructor I had for lit hum was about average- he spoke about the historical context of the works as most people snoozed.  Like many classes, the environment was such that for the couple people who stayed awake, there was the pressure of only opening your mouth to say things that were very profound.  The problem though is that, especially in such circumstances, freshmen never say anything brilliant and profound: they just wind up using big words out of context and boring even themselves.  \nTwo things struck me my first day in Miller\u00c2\u2019s class: noone was asleep (despite it being a 9am class) and people were talking, interrupting each other good naturedly, and laughing.  Miller makes sure that his classroom is never stuffy or pretentious.  In the middle of a discussion about St. Augustine, he will write a list on the board about the top ten things a man looks for in a woman from out of his wife\u00c2\u2019s \u00c2\u201cCosmo.\u00c2\u201d  And when it came down to it, discussions in which students were able to express themselves and their ideas even if it involves quoting Oprah are not only engaging, but often do actually reach those levels of profundity which were never reached in my first class.\nBut it is not only his personality and way of engaging the class that makes this class so inspiring.  His approach to teaching this course is not to give us a few choice quotes to use at corporate cocktail parties.  He does much more than that: he teaches you about life and does so not by preaching, but by presenting a rigorous challenge to any of your preconceived notions of who and what you want to be.  He teaches all of the thing that people claim can\u00c2\u2019t be learned in school.\nWhen a friend of mine wanted to look at Columbia, the first thing I did was to bring her to this class.  Miller epitomizes all of the reasons that glossy brochure convinced you to chose Columbia and does so with kindness and true concern for each of his students.  One of the few professors to whose office hours students go just to chat, even though they are at 8am Monday morning.  Do whatever you can to find a way into his class!\n\nWorkload:\nThe papers are long, but not bad because they are on interesting topics.  They are the sort of papers that you write way in advance because you use them to procrastinate from your more immediate but not nearly as compelling ones.   Though he is challenging, he will always meet with you to discuss your ideas and will even edit your enitre draft if you email it to him.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nAs a rising senior, I have never taken a class quite like RTM's.  RTM makes a concerted effort to get to know each of his students on an individual level.  If one makes a reference to one's home state, RTM might recall the person's home town.   At the same time, RTM's lectures are filled with fun anecdotes about his life experiences.  So, students get to know RTM and RTM gets to know his students.  \nAfter the first paper is handed back,  each student sets up an appointment with him to discuss where s/he is going in the class.  While the idea of a one-to-one conversation with an instructor might seem daunting, it isn't.  RTM offers constructive criticism.  \nRTM gives the class a substantial background in philosophy, providing a solid base for CC in the next year  (Having taken CC before Lit Hum, I found that RTM's lecture comments shed some light on CC retroactively).  While our discussions sometimes centered a bit too much on the underlying philosophy of the author, some of the most important points in the works did not go unnoticed: namely, what is and is not important for humans  and how to live a fulfilling life.  \n\nWorkload:\nTwo papers, each approximately 10 pages, no midterm, final doesn't really count unless you do horribly on it.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nAt 8:00 AM every Monday and Wednesday morning, Robert T. Miller takes his seat at a corner table in Caf\u00c3\u00a9 212.  He places a yellow steno pad in front of him, on which he has outlined the tasks for the day in his neat, black handwriting.  Sometimes he gets a Croissant?his favorites have that slice of chocolate wedged between the folds of pastry?sometimes he gets an orange juice.  Whatever the breakfast, Professor Miller eats it slowly, contently, as he waits for his students to arrive.\n\tProfessor Miller?s office hours may seem unorthodox, but so too is the man.  Any other professor would balk at scheduling these bi-weekly meetings an hour before the nine o?clock class time, but Professor Miller does so confidently.  As well he should, too; each time I arrive the fashionable fifteen minutes late I see him already engaged, or perhaps already engaging, a peer of mine in thoughtful conversation.  Students want to come; they want to hear what he has to say, and they want to share with him their own discoveries.  The best thing about Professor Miller is that he wants to share as well.\n\tAt 8:55 the gathering travels across the quad to the second floor of Hamilton, to the classroom that has housed the most profound intellectual and moral growth of my life.  Two rows of desks line the long sides of the room; these rows flank the lectern at the head of the class where, in quiet and deliberate steps, Professor Miller sets down his briefcase, takes off his watch, removes his jacket, rolls up his sleeves, and begins to teach.\n\tThe first time I saw Professor Miller enact this ritual was a summery Wednesday in early September.  He told us almost immediately that we might have to remind him to speak up, as he has a tendency to mumble.  Somewhat worried that I might miss a lot of the lecture on the Iliad, I trained my ears on the man in front of me and my pencil on my paper, prepared, I guess, for anything.  His first words, however, were not about Achilles, nor Homer, nor anything that I thought related to my first year literature course.  Instead he asked, in clear, declamatory English, ?How should you live? What?s good?  What?s bad? What?s important?  What?s worth pursuing?  What?s worth avoiding?  What makes for a truly good human life??\n\tI could not possibly have foreseen, as I sat quietly flabbergasted in my chair, the far reaching effects that those questions would have on my life.  Using such inquiries as an introduction to Aristotelian morality, RTM (an abbreviated nickname the class has begun affectionately to use) has walked me and twenty-one fellow freshman through the books of the Lit. Hum syllabus.  He keeps those questions close at hand, for he asserts (and I now firmly believe) that these books are great because they answer those questions.  The books make an attempt to tackle the big issues, and they do so with grace and eloquence.  RTM tackles these big issues, and that?s why I think he?s great.\n\tIndependent of his morality, RTM selflessly dedicates himself to his students and their academic progress.  My email box weekly receives thoughtfully chosen supplemental readings, all of which he provides simply for the class? enjoyment.  He assigns two papers a semester, the first four to seven pages and the second a hefty ten to fifteen.  I sent him a draft of my first essay at 11:00 AM on a Sunday morning, and by 1:15 that afternoon he returned it with extensive comments.  Over the Christmas break I sent him an e-mail asking which translation of the Inferno to buy, and he called me back that evening, long distance and late New York time, ready with both the information and kind words for me and my family.  It always strikes me, however, that no matter how special or important he makes me feel as a student, he does the same for the rest of the class.\nFew have effected me more profoundly than Robert T. Miller\nWorkload:\nChallenging and rewarding\n"

            "review_content": "\nRobert Miller singlehandedly justifies the core. He is brilliant; he is endearing; he puts exorbitant effort into preparing his lectures, grading papers, and writing mass email after mass email. He doesn't teach Lit Hum as a dry review of historical contexts or forgettable literary theories, but instead uses the texts as a springboard for philosophical discussions, to gently guide his students towards discovering and refining their own beliefs. RTM attended Columbia as an undergrad, so he understands what it's like to be on the other side of the podium. He will do just about anything to help you write and think critically. His comments on emailed paper proposals are thorough, prompt, and useful; he offers specific references in Aristotle, the Bible, works of criticism, etc., to correspond to your arguments. Be prepared for an endless stream of bitter but entertaining lawyer jokes, usually at the expense of Yale Law School. (He's a corporate lawyer turned philosophy grad student.) This man is marvelous. Count your blessings.\nWorkload:\nYou can get away with not finishing every reading assignment, but his lectures and the ensuing (or interrupting) discussions tend towards the extremely philosophical, so it helps to have at least some knowledge of the text to which to apply the philosophy. He assigns two papers a semester. The first is 8-10 pages, the second no less than 15, and both are heavily philosophical, much harder but also much better than the usual thematic worthlessness that Lit Hum teachers assign. Plus, his comments are extensive and fascinating. In Spring 2002, he added four works to the syllabus: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (ugh... but he spent a mercifully short time on it), and then Faust, Four Quartets, and The Wasteland, all of which were fantastic, and taught with painstaking care. \n"

Its true that the conversations can get a bit complex, but listen up! Most of those philosophical dudes have something good to say. I say take RTM his knowledge will amaze you, and you may learn more about yourself than the actual material.\nWorkload:\nOnly downfall is the papers, you only have 2, and they are long, and usually very philosophical (lots of stuff about the good life), but you also have a long time to complete them.

Not to say that the class does not require work, it does, but RTM has a genuine interest both in the literature and his students and that makes the work go by much faster. Easily sidetracked and filled with a morbid distaste for lawyers (although he used to be one), RTM will make anyone who shows up half awake truly interested in the material. Beyond the actual books, however, he subtly offers his students worthwhile advice on life and columbia, as he is a former grad. He's a big dork, but it's one of his most endearing qualities. A huge fan of mass emails, he's the hardest working lit hum professor for sure, as there is always feedback and internet links from class discussion in my mail box. Don't let his bullshit sermon on the first day scare you; he's a big pussycat and well worth it for the required year of lit hum.\nWorkload:\nRTM is probably one of the smartest men i have ever met and as such his papers are demanding. Two a semester, the first about 7 pages, the second 10 or more. He hates the standardized finals and barely weights them. At least a partial reading of all of the books is required.
