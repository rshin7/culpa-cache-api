            "review_content": "\nLevinson handed out the syllabus on the first day, and I think that over the semester we made it about half way through.  Why?  Because he lectures on EVERY detail in the reading.  This sentence here, that word here, and continually gets lost on long, unrelated tangents.  In this class, you will learn very little, and spend hous in class tuning Levinson out.  The material is pretty interesting, but it's lost on Levinson's lackluster and over-obvious analysis.  You can definitely find better professors for this class.  If you're really interested in the subject (He focuses on medical and technology sociology), then take him.  Otherwise, hold out for a better/different professor.\nWorkload:\nEasy, that's the upside.  Weekly readings that you don't really have to do.  2 short papers, and a final.  No midterm, which is awesome.  Plus, he's a pretty fair/average grader.\n"
