Rina's class is always lighthearted and fun, but you're also always learning.  Rina's background in linguistics means she knows how to teach the language in a way that students understand.  She's also just a great, caring, sassy person; get to know her outside of class, too.  Basically, take this class.  You won't regret it.\nWorkload:\nTotally fair.  Daily exercises that reinforce concepts learned in class, a few quizzes per semester that she prepares you for completely.  If you put a little effort in, you'll do well.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nI am grateful to have had Rina as a professor. \nFirst of all, I don't know how she does it. In the Hebrew language program, students come from a range of Hebrew backgrounds, some have studied for ten years at Yeshiva, some have lived in Israel, and others like me began their course of study at Columbia. I went through several years of Hebrew at Columbia and consider Rina to be the best in her department. There are other great professors in the department, but none that can hold a torch to Rina.\nI struggled with Hebrew and had to work really hard to catch up with the other students, and Rina was there to help me along the way. She was willing to meet me in her free time to read through texts with me. In the end, I was able to do as well as the other students and this was a huge payoff. Its a good feeling to know that when something is difficult, if you work hard, you will succeed. To me that is the sign of a great teacher, someone who can take the student who struggles the most, but works hard can do as well as the other students with more experience. \nThe subject matter she taught was practical, useful and interesting. There was one story we read about the human emotions that I will save forever. In addition, we talked about job interviews, and composing resumes in Hebrew. We also made a presentation, which gave us an opportunity to hone our public speaking skills. The texts she gave us ranged from biographies to food. \nI am graduating. I had to fill one more Hebrew requirement, another teacher told me that her class would be to hard for me and Rina gladly accommodated me into her class and it was well worth it. She works really hard at what she does and I was lucky to have her as a teacher. \n\nWorkload:\nShe gives five quizzes, one presentation and one Final. She does a fantastic job of preparing you for the quizzes and gives practice quizzes, if you study you will do well in her class.\n"

            "review_content": "\nRina Kreitman is a fantastic professor.  Her classes move a reasonably fast pace, so you always feel like you're learning.  She also has a good lingustic background so she is great at answering questions.  She also is realistic about what you have to know and doesn't make you memorize grammar or vocabulary that is not actually used in spoken language. Very approachable and accomodating, let's you have extra time on tests and is available readily for appointments.  \nWorkload:\nNightly homework, biweekly quizes, final.  All graded really easily\n"

The class I took prepared me well, taught me quickly and was downright enjoyable.  Rina is hilarious, also, and you feel like you are talking to one of your friends.  She is awesome.  Rina is also legit from Israel, so there is a cultural component as well.\nWorkload:\nNot bad at all.  A few exercises per night, and a quiz every two weeks or so.\n"

            "review_content": "\nTo anyone considering beginning/continuing Hebrew, I recommend Rina without hesitation.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve now had the privilege of taking 4 semesters with her, and if given the opportunity, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d instantly take 4 more.\nHer methods of teacher and presenting information cater to all types of learners.  She is clear, concise, and extremely thorough.  In addition, her extensive background in Linguistics enables her to explain clearly intricacies and nuances of the Hebrew language that non-native speakers often find difficult and confusing.  \nRina wants nothing more than for her students to succeed, and she works herself to the bone to see that we do.  Every handout is promptly posted on Courseworks; she is always readily available to discuss the material via e-mail or by appointment; she reliably provides comprehensive vocabulary lists and review sheets prior to each quiz, and her grading is more than fair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in fact, it verges on lenient. \nNot only is she the best language teacher this university has to offer, she is also one of my favorite people at Columbia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an all-around wonderful person, both inside the classroom and out.  If you are so fortunate as to snag a spot in her class, hold on to it.  Not only will you have a great learning experience, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make a great friend along the way.   \n \nWorkload:\nThe workload is pretty light, although you do actually have to study for the quizzes (but she helps you out A TON). Homework varies, though RARELY more than 30 min. a night. 3-4 quizzes per semester, some kind of small interactive project, and a final exam.\n"
