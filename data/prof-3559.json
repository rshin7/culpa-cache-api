Subir is friendly, engaging and a much better teacher than Prof. Flynn---I learned most of the material for this class in Subir's recitation. He's also extremely accommodating about the weekly quizzes---he's almost always happy to give people extra time past the end of recitation, let me reschedule one so I could see a WLF speaker, and gave everybody all of Thanksgiving break to take the last quiz home. If you can get one of Subir's sections I strongly recommend it.\nWorkload:\nWeekly quizzes generally on the material just covered in recitation, so there's rarely an excuse to do poorly.\n"
