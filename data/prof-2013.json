            "review_content": "\nProfessor Peterson is by far one of the best professors MEALAC has to offer. Besides being fluent in five languages, and an accomplished singer, she is a wonderful, kind human being. As a professor, she is just as diverse and remarkable in her ability to convey complex material to her students, while empowering them to voice their own opinions, no matter how nervous or simplistic they deem these to be. She respects and rewards hard work, enthusiasm, creativity, and true intellect. I felt like i could talk endlessly about any subject with her. She has a keen aesthetic sense to compliment her academic rigor, and tries to incorporate film, art, poetry, and song into her lectures.  I would recommend taking any course offered by her.  \nWorkload:\nweekly readings to be discussed in class; short papers based on films; midterm paper; final paper; excellent reading selections\n"
