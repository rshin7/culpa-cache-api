            "review_content": "\nChristia is absolutely amazing. Besides possessing a wealth of knowledge in different areas of philosophy, she's one of those professors that truly cares about her students and will encourage them every step of the way. She's not afraid to voice her opinions in lecture, especially about politics (as some have already stated). This may bother some students, but I found her openness very refreshing and endearing. She's very clear about who she is and what she stands for, which goes a long way in making her more approachable as a person and mentor.\nPhilosophy and Feminism provided a good introduction to philosophy, as well as the changing attitudes about sex and gender throughout history. She said on the first class that the course was Philosophy AND Feminism, not Philosophy OF Feminism or Feminism IN Philosophy. She definitely stuck with this idea, as the course began with philosophical ideas (think Plato) and eventually turned more sociological near the end (like discussing the Prison Industrial Complex or Anita Hill case). The class was definitely geared towards more introductory students, as all of the papers had very clear and direct prompts and the class consisted of a midterm and final with passage IDs (which usually doesn't happen in upper-level philosophy courses). \nThat being said, I'd definitely recommend the class to other philosophy majors (as well as other students), as Christia covered a lot of very complicated texts (like Judith Butler's Gender Trouble or Foucault's History of Sexuality), albeit at a very approachable level for the rest of the class. Regardless, the choices in her syllabus are definitely worth reading, and if you're interested delving further, going to office hours to meet with Christia about them. Also I don't think I would have been introduced to such a sheer diversity of topics in another philosophy course (epistemic justice, objectivity in science, discourse-power, feminist epistemology, prison industrial complex, Augustine's impact on feminism, performative gender, etc etc). Christia does a very great job of weaving these ideas together.\nChristia definitely wanted all of her students to succeed and actually take away something from the course. I'm not sure about the exact grading distribution, but I think it's very likely that if you put in effort and genuinely think about these texts and ideas (as you should be doing anyway), you'll do well in this course -- and hopefully leave having become a more aware person.\nAlso if you're given the chance, take a seminar with her too! She's great in lecture, but she is even better in smaller more intimate setting (as are most professors). \nAs a last note, Christia shares this Foucault quote a lot in class, where Foucault says his philosophy is like a toolbox and he \"writes for users, not readers.\" This is definitely the focus of Christia's class and she leaves all her students very well-prepared to apply the knowledge gained from this class to various different fields and aspects of life. In short, TAKE THIS CLASS.\nAlso shoutout to TA Conor Cullen! He's great, helpful, kind, and made himself readily available to his students!\nWorkload:\n-- 3 essays (1 page single spaced, 1 page single spaced, 3-4 pages double spaced) about a very specific topic. She literally gives you the texts to use (sometimes even passages) and the general argument to make. The essays, I think, are more to show you understand these ideas and how different texts relate to each other\n--1 midterm, very early in the semester. Basically identify some passage IDs, pick 3-4 and write about what they mean, how they fit into the argument, etc. 10% of grade. The purpose of the midterm is to encourage you to keep up with readings early on and get a better sense of what the final will be\n--1 final, more passage IDs, identify ~10 of them, analyze 5, and then write a personal essay using different texts. I liked the idea of a personal essay, and it really reinforced her desire for us to think more deeply and personally about the texts we were reading\n--10 posts: these are 200-300 words each about something you saw in the world and how it related to what we've discussed in class. Very cool idea to encourage us to think about the texts outside of class. Can pace them out however you want, but 10 by the last day of class\n"

Everyone I spoke to in the class worshipped her, and, as many often said, hoped \"to one day become half the person professor Mercer is\". She was funny, charming, and highly encapturing. Anyone could tell that she was thoroughly passionate about her work, as well as about the general state of affairs at Columbia. I can honestly say that Professor Mercer changed the way I see the world through her lectures on oppression, power, change, etc. Take this class, any class, with Professor Mercer if you can. It will be one of your best experiences at Columbia, guaranteed. \nWorkload:\nNot too much. 3 essays. The first two are one page single-spaced (though dense), and the third is 3-4 double spaced. There is a final, which was graded very fairly. Professor Mercer wants to see that you've learned a lot in the course and applied her teachings to your life- as long as you can convey this, you are fine. 1 post each week on a current event. 1 in-class exam. \n"

As Professor Mercer said, this course will give you the tools you need to shape and better understand the world you live. And, better yet, change it!

If you have...this is a must too! Just do it.\nLast, but not least, Professor Mercer teaches the course with enthusiasm, tries to get to know each one of her students and strikes the perfect balance between class discussion and lecturing. It's a pleasure to be in this class. \nAt least, sit on the class the first week just to see how you feel about it.\n\nWorkload:\nThe workload is reasonable, and readings very well selected.

She even had our class over to her home for a delicious Italian dinner and casual discussion of what we were reading.

The class was very enjoyable, especially with the cookies we get to eat every time! \nThere is one thing to keep in mind. It would be a lie if I said Mercer is an easy grader. You really have to work hard in the class in order to do well. The quizzes are made specifically to test if you have read the 300 page book last weekend and can remember the details. However, her methods work because she does make you read everything, which is the least you can get out of the class if you're taking it, right?

            "review_content": "\nChristia Mercer is one of the best teachers I have had at Columbia.  She is truly brilliant, and her classes are not only clear but also fun, which is something remarkable when you are studying philosophers like Descartes and Kant.  I always looked forward to her lectures.\nIn response to an earlier review, which complained that Professor Mercer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s classes do not contain enough historical information, I say that studying the history of philosophy is different from studying history.  The history of philosophy has to do with the evolution of human thought, not with historical details about individual philosophers.  Professor Mercer focuses on a the central question\u00e2\u20ac\u201dWhat is there really?   The reason we study questions like this one, is that in order to understand and write about philosophy, we must know what other philosophers have said, and how they said it.  For example, we have to know what Cartesian dualism is in other to engage in a meaningful discussion about the mind/body problem.  It is not just that the opinions of these philosophers are relevant today, but also that we need to know what has been said by others in order to formulate our own opinions.  I too was once frustrated by having to study the arguments of outdated thinkers, but I now understand why we do it.  Furthermore, Professor Mercer actually provided a good amount of historical context for the philosophers she introduced\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmuch more than in my previous history of philosophy course.\nIn addition, Professor Mercer enriched the class by including female philosophers, who often go overlooked in this type of course.  Her class was taught at the right level, and her lectures were stimulating and entertaining.  She explained the topics thoroughly and with care, spending extra time on the more difficult arguments.  She also had amazing PowerPoint slides and, almost every class, had something extra like a puppet, a painting related to the subject matter, a comical text, etc.  I highly recommend her class.  It is well organized, well taught, and a lot of fun. \nP.S. I am also a philosophy major.\n\nWorkload:\n3 one page papers, 1 five page paper, a midterm and a final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI'm guessing that the previous reviewer didn't take History of Philosophy I, because the first course with Katja Vogt was the same way -  we studied the metaphysics of philosophers from Pre-Socratic through to Augustine, so personally, I didn't find this course weird or existentially crisis-inducing. Maybe the previous reviewer had a hard TA, but I pulled an A despite my horrible Spinoza paper.\nWith that said, I do have a few comments about Professor Mercer. For every philosopher we would cover, it's really either her way or the high way. If you can't agree with her interpretation (or her \"standing by her man\" as she'd call it - and trust me they are very strong/extreme opinions) then your opinions will be disregarded. And for the several lectures we would spend on a certain philosopher, she would only go over a few points about that philosopher's metaphysics, just in like 12 different ways. It makes studying for the exams easier because when you reread your notes and sort of reorganize them, you realize you have, say, a page-tops for Descartes despite the 7 pages of scribbling you did during the 2 weeks we spent on him. She also sometimes doesn't answer questions quite straight-forwardly. I often resorted to my TA to ask questions instead because her answers never seemed to help me all that much. Another note was that she would almost never remember when class finishes, so 80% of the time, she never really finished what she had wanted to say. Lecture notes or something that could be posted on courseworks so we have a guideline of what to expect + if we run out of time, we know what we'd have to catch up on would have been helpful. But that may just be me speaking from my experience with other professors who did something of this nature.\nI can see how this would have been dissatisfying for philosophy majors - I'm one too and I took this to fulfill the requirement - but if you actually go to class, take notes and pay attention to what she's saying (because you'll immediately pick up on what she thinks is \"cool\" i.e. will be a big part of the exams) then you should be fine.\nWorkload:\n3 short papers - Each are one-page, single spaced. You just have to basically explicate a passage from the philosophers that we're reading - she'll give you choices. The Descartes one was annoying to do because, unlike the other two papers, she didn't give us any sort of 'guide questions' to know which direction you should take the papers. I guess the passages were supposed to 'speak for themselves' or something?\n1 longer paper - Five pages double spaced. It's on Kant/Hume, mainly. There was a choice to write it like a dialogue, a la Plato which wasn't appealing.\n1 midterm - IDs, short answer, one 'long essay' which is really just like 2-3 paragraphs.\n1 final - IDs (all post-midterm), a Kant 'essay', and a sort of comprehensive 'compare these 3 philosophers regarding x,y,z' type essay.\nWhy we had a paper due during reading week and then a final, I will never know.\n"

Full disclosure, the grade for the final has not yet been submitted, but up till now I have a B+ in this course and as far as I can tell, a great deal of the class is doing significantly worse than this. I only put this first in order to state clearly that I'm not someone that got a terrible grade and then sought revenge by posting a negative review on Mea Culpa.\nProfessor Mercer is a true scholar of philosophy.There can be no doubt about that. But the point I want to put forward is that the subject material covered in this class is almost totally irrelevant for anyone that doesn't hold a deep, abiding interest in antiquated metaphysical systems. Based on the title of this class, I had assumed that I would be taking a history of philosophy class, meaning the reconstruction of historical events that help to put the course of later developments in philosophical thought into a better context. I was thus quite surprised that the semester more resembled the following: a new philosopher every week, of whom we were expected to memorize the intricacies of their particular views on metaphysics. What's the problem with this? Simply that the majority of these people held views that are silly if not outright laughable within the context of modern scientific thought. Why is that a problem? Well, learning the ins and outs of Leibniz's ludicrous views on causation or memorizing Kant's now discredited thoughts on the analytic/synthetic propositional distinction just holds little relevance for the contemporary undergraduate. Real history of course does not. The moments when Professor Mercer actually delved into the historical currents of the time and what impact they might have had on the philosopher in question were among some of the most interesting moments of the class. But these moments were sadly few and far between.\nSo, my warning is essentially as follows: this is not a course concerning the events that influenced historically important philosophical thinkers. This is a course concerning what those thinkers thought about metaphysics. What this has to do with anything beyond a narrow niche of historical study I don't know. As an undergraduate philosophy major even I know that many of the points made by these historical figures have no standing within the contemporary philosophical body of knowledge. They influenced but were superseded which is it should be if philosophy is actually a science. \nAnd my final point is this: if philosophy is a science (and this premise is assumed because why would it be a major offering at a prestigious research facility if it were not?) then this class either needs to be re-configured and moved to the history department or be simply done away with. As it stands it is not philosophy (as there is no mention of the contemporary body of philosophical knowledge) and it is not history (as there was almost no effort to provide information on the actual relevant and contextual history that influenced and was influenced by these thinkers.) So what is it then? A waste of time. Spare yourself the existential crisis I experienced from time wasted on rote memorization of utterly irrelevant concepts.\nWorkload:\nSignificant.\n"

I can't say for sure whether any one of them gave worse grades than the others. Prof. Mercer seemed very concerned about grading standards (she did say usually no more than 1/3 of the class gets an A or A-), so I would assume she would be comparing their averages to keep it consistent.  But personally I found Daniel to be a VERY difficult grader, and his comments, while not exactly unkind, were certainly blunt.  \nI'll be honest and admit I never went to his office hours.  Maybe it's unfair to judge by appearances, but he seems completely unapproachable.  Have you ever had a graduate student TA who actually wears a jacket and tie to most every class?  Me neither.  So I went to Mark and Ariadna's office hours instead, a couple times for each of them, and found both to be extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help even though I wasn't in their section.

            "review_content": "\nThere are two kinds of students who take Philosophy and Feminism: philosophers, and feminists. I would caution anyone in the former category who is considering taking this class to think about it again.\nBefore I begin, let me explain the many \"disagree\" votes that will surely be cast upon this review \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I took this class for the opposite reason that most others did (I was a philosopher, they were feminists), which from the outset doomed me to a semester of slight frustration with this class. Our spring 2010 section was, unsurprisingly, 92% female. Most of these were the Barnard, fair-trade-coffee-drinking liberal elitist type who went to SXSW for spring break. I don't dislike these women \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I, in fact, a lot of the time more or less fit into this stereotype. However, I had taken philosophy classes before and was planning on being a philosophy concentrator and was taking the class to do philosophy, whereas most of my classmates were there to learn about women and their struggle.\nThis general characteristic of my classmates led to the almost universal worship of Christia Mercer. I don't dislike Christia \u00e2\u20ac\u201d she is a fairly cool woman, she tells funny stories, she swears, she's not married to the father of her children out of solidarity for gay marriage rights. She is also a fairly interesting lecturer. Okay, great. But the one big problem I had with Christia was how often she repeated the phrase, \"Sorry, now I'm just ranting, BUT...\" It is wonderful that she is so interested in feminism and is invested in what she is teaching us, but when her lectures so frequently collapse into Christia Mercer's Very Strong Opinions About Topic X, I think there is something fundamentally wrong with the structure of the course.\nTherefore, for those who agreed with Christia's opinions simply by virtue of the fact that they were feminists who hadn't taken the time to really think their reasoning through, the class was wonderful. But for those of us who held alternate opinions, her lectures were slightly frustrating. Our unit titled \"Ethnicity, Gender, and Truth\" was perhaps the best example of this: we spent two weeks reading essays about the Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas debacle, and it was clear by the end of the first lecture on this unit that there was only ONE correct interpretation of the events. In other words, Christia's Way or the High Way. There was an incident during one lecture in which some particularly strong-minded students openly disagreed with her; everyone else in the class was of the opinion that these students were simply being belligerent troublemakers. The way they addressed Christia was indeed a bit hostile, but Christia's equally brutal response to their points made me cringe. It was clear to me that several months' worth of pent-up frustration with Christia's teaching style had simply gotten to them.\nHowever, let me finish this review with the good news (?) that even if you disagree with everything Christia is saying, you will still probably be able to do reasonably well in the class. The only thing graded is your papers, and as long as you argue convincingly you'll do fine.\nThe only thing you should think about before taking this class is whether you'll be able to stand a semester's worth of Christia's opinion-spouting. It's not impossible to get something out of the class, but if you're a proponent of approaching philosophy objectively, I would caution you against taking this class.\nWorkload:\nReasonable. Reading for each class, most of which can be skimmed since the main points will be elaborated upon in class. Three one-page papers, one five-page paper. Two lecture analyses. The final is made up of passage IDs and a wishy-washy essay.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI cannot begin to sing professor Mercer's praises high enough.  She is incredibly passionate about the material.  She can take things as dry as Aquinas' principals of nature and transform them into living, breathing (often hilarious) real-life examples.  She makes you appreciate philosophy as a logical, meaningful, and sometimes beautiful way to think about the world.  I too often hear, \"what's the point of taking philosophy courses, it's just pure sophistry!\" Take a class with Christia Mercer and she will change your mind.  If she doesn't then don't take any more philosophy classes because nothing in the major will be as exciting as having her explain Descartes' Meditations of how crazy Leibniz is!\nHer lecture style is not traditional.  You feel like you are either sitting by the fireside chatting about big ideas or you are on some great roller coaster. The class mandates your undivided attention if you want to keep up with Mercer.  People find her tangents and repeated pauses for questions to be really frustrating.  I understand their concerns.  If you want a straight out of the book explanation of the history of philosophy from Aquinas to Kant then you may want to take this class during a year when Mercer isn't teaching it, but if you are willing to commit yourself to the course, then you will get a lot out of it.\nThe final aspect of any class is, as always, the grade.  Mercer herself admits that her class is really hard.  I find this to be untrue.  The TA's grade everything and while some just want to get through their TA requirement and thus spend very little time critiquing your work, others will tear you apart.  The TA's will probably change but, if they don't, stay away from Mark and try to take Daniel. \nWorkload:\n3 one page (single spaced) responses to topics that are handed out well in advance.  These can really hurt if you don't know how to write a paper for a philosophy class, but they weight your grade if you consistently improve on the papers throughout the semester.\nMidterm-Honestly, studying for this midterm with my friends was one of the best academic experiences I have had at Columbia. It was great to make a study guide and go over it until 3 in the morning laughing the whole time at Mercer's examples from class. The test itself is really easy if you take good notes and spend 2-3 days going over them before the test.\n5 page paper due at the end of the semester.  It's a philosophical dialogue, It's about Kant. It's awesome.\nFinal-see Midterm.\n"

Compared to many of my friends' Lit Hum professors, Mercer was a relatively tough grader and expects a lot out of her students. We had a difficult detailed quiz about 75% of the time we had new reading, however, she does give you (some) credit despite many wrong answers and, because we had quizzes over the reading all semester, we did not have to do the identifications for the final.  We also had three short papers, all of which were graded harshly (half of the class got C's on the first paper), and she is experienced enough as a professor to know how much effort the student has put into their paper.  Her midterm was difficult as well, asking students to analyze 4 passages in less than 2 hours, which was a ridiculous task for all of us to begin with, and was difficult to get an A on as well.\nOn the positive side, however, Mercer is a very approachable professor.  She is helpful in office hours, and even encourages students to just stop by and chat.  She uses analogies like \"Emory the Tree,\" which ultimately became a class inside joke, but nonetheless was relative to all of the works we read regarding human capacity and excellence.  She brought us food on several occasions, and even brought cookies and grapes to the final exam. She lets you go outside on nice days to discuss the books rather than sitting in the classroom.  She even took the class to Hamlet with Jude Law and took us out for soda after, and also invited us over to her apartment for dinner.\nI will truly miss Mercer next semester. Sure she interjects her social and political views into class discussion, but this didn't interfere too much with the class.  Sure she has her favorites, but this doesn't get in the way when she grades.  Sure she isn't afraid to give you a worse grade than maybe another professor would, but she makes you work harder and helps you to become a better writer and student. If you are really into getting A's like free lollipops, she is not the professor for you. But if you really want to learn something, she is a professor that you shouldn't miss out on.\nWorkload:\n13 ridiculously hard quizzes (goes into participation grade, 15%)\n3 papers, 3 pg. 12%, 4 pg. 16%, 5 pg. 20%\nHARD midterm 16%\nStandard Lit Hum final (which she prepares you well for) 21%\n\n"

She is an incredibly bright philosophical mind, yet the most humble professor I have encountered at Columbia. More than anything, she wants her students to fully grasp the material at hand (and hopefully, be affected by it as well). She recounts personal (and often, humorous) anecdotes in attempting to illustrate concepts from the texts. She'll often sit on the front table, knees crossed, as she listens to students share their thoughts about the class material. She has the most miraculous way of making a 60+ lecture very, very, intimate. Absolutely Nothing is boring with this woman. This might also be because the class material is so exciting. While the texts are not very philosophically demanding (some philosophy majors get frustrated with this, but i wasn't), they are all very gripping. Once again, I just have to illustrate how humble and wonderful Mercer is. She teaches for everyone.

Mercer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tension rises visibly when an account of sexually-based injustice prickles her but she can also laugh at such accounts for their absurdity. The reading is dense, dense, dense, but usually fascinating, if you can get through it.

The readings were pretty interesting, and Mercer was certainly passionate about them, but she basically repeated the same couple of points all semester and continually interrupted students during discussion. She also tried way too hard to be profound and inspiring, and her metaphors to this effect were pretty strange. Some students went for it and seemed deeply inspired, but I'm not quite sure why. Her lectures sometimes got ridiculous (she tried to teach us Plato by naming the tree outside the window Betsy, and also told us that an excellent way to challenge societal norms was to run up to our uncles and scream \"Blow job!\"). The papers were interesting and challenging, and reviewing them with the TA  helped, but Mercer was more interested in being a tough grader in theory than in actually challenging us and making us better writers.

I missed one lecture due to an intense week and realized a) how much i missed her wonderfully entertaining/informative/organized lectures and b) how much more lucid the reading was when accompanied by her explanations (which made it crystal clear as to which nuances of the texts we should pay attention and how to interpret them).  My only regret is not also taking Philosophy and Feminism (despite the fact that I find other subject matters in the philosophy department infinitely more interesting) this semester, as she is going away next year.  I never once fell asleep, despite a 9 am right before her lecture, I thought the grading was extremely fair (perhaps a bit easy), comments on the exams and papers were very helpful (especially in directing how to study/write on subsequent topics/examinations).  I never once went to office hours, asked maybe 2 in-class questions, never had outside contact with her, and ended up with a very good grade--clearly, the \"favorites\" comments are very misled, if not simply bitter.  It is important to be familiar with the reading, if not during the course then at least before the exams, and to write very clearly (if not too simply) on papers.  I enjoyed the class immensely and hope that she comes back to the Philosophy department in 2006-2007 teaching numerous other courses so I can have her as a professor again.  As for the course material, it's based in metaphysics and epistemology (as aforementioned in others' reviews), which was not only a great choice for narrowing down topics in view of the time period covered, but also interesting and very useful as an intro philosophy class (which it is considered to be).

Right off the bat she told us that it was very hard to get an A in her class, that she would not be impressed by people, usually men she said, who try to \"do philosophy\" in front of the whole class, and she admonished us not to plagiarize or try to buy papers on the internet.  So being a male and one who values education and would never have thought to buy a paper on the internet I was somewhat offended.  If I'd stopped going to the class after that I'm sure I would have the same negative view of Mercer that some reviewers have expressed. But the fact is Mercer is a pretty good prof.\nI'm not sure if her initial harshness is a product of her personality or an intentional device to get students to respect her, but either way she does warm up a lot as the semester goes on.  She's actually a bit of a comedian--well, ok, more than a bit--and this can sometimes be annoying, but at other times she'll really get the class to crack up.  She's also much more approachable then she seems.  I never went to office hours, but the few times I went to ask a question after class she was very receptive and not at all scary.  She also gave pretty good review sessions that you should definitely go to--she doesn't tell you exactly what's on the test but she'll give you some clues as to what to reread and what issues to think about. \nI thought she did a good job of outlining the key ideas in a way that made the texts more comprehensible.  Her lectures usually got me excited to read the texts, and definitely helped me understand them--plus I never once came close to falling asleep in class, which is more than I can say for some profs at this school.  As to the comment that she focuses on minutia, I completely disagree.  If anything I would have liked a bit more detail on certain philosophers, (yes, the Descartes circular argument thing is a bit confusing, but that was the only idea in the whole course that felt less than essential. also you were never required to write about it--I didn't).\nAs far as the accusations of sexism, I saw no evidence of this except for that one comment the first day.   Maybe twice during the semester she mentioned that women philosophers had had a hard time getting heard, and she had us read Anne Conway instead of Locke.  Big deal.  I actually avoided the class last year because of these accusations, but they are hugely exaggerated.  I wouldn't be surprised if she'd read the reviews on this site and made that comment just to mess with us--she's definitely a bit mischievous.  Anyway, it's no reason to avoid the class.  And as far playing favorites goes, if it's true I never saw it and I definitely wasn't one of them, but I worked hard and ended up with a precious A.  This class is definitely worth taking.\nWorkload:\nTwo 6 pagers, midterm, final.  Not much reading before the midterm, but then longer more difficult texts after--try not to get too far behind in the second half.

Yet even those students get a nod for good dissenting arguments.\nIn the end, Prof. Mercer is not my favorite person in the world, but she is a wonderful teacher who lets you know her expectations and provides you with interesting and intellectual materials.\nWorkload:\ntwo 3-4 page papers, one 6 page final paper, 3 lecture analysis.\n"

After you finish this course, you will want to be her friend and hang out with her and her kids after class.  Seriously.  The lectures were not boring at all (contrary to the art hum stereotype) and the premise of the class was actually to learn the material rather than read up on it and memorize names and dates.  Instead of reading every night, she instead encourages students to \"look\" at the paintings to understand them on a personal level.  It's great.  And Since she is the head of the Philosophy department as well, she does a great job in bringing the paintings into the larger context of the thought process of their time periods.  If you end up in Prof. Mercer's Art Hum class, feel blessed.  After I taking Art Hum with her, Im now contemplating majoring in Art History and I'm trying to register for any other classes that she teaches.  You will really come out with a true understanding and appreciation of the material after her course.\nWorkload:\nBarely existent - \"looking\" at about 25-30 pictures of art online, with occasional EASY pop quizes the next day that you will ACE if you merely glace at the pictures and read their titles; 3-4 short 3 page papers that are graded leniently; EASY, EASY midterm and an even easier final.\n"

She knows a ton about both philosophy and art which led to interesting discussions about the two. She also has a great sense of humor and isn't lacking in self-confidence. She was never shy about letting us know how busy/important she was or how many committees she was on. But that's half the fun. She grades fairly, is very accessible to students, and leads very thought provoking discussions that get most people in the class involved. I thought art hum would be a drag but I was pleasantly surprised...and I have Christia to thank. I'd like to nominate her for CULPA Gold Nugget status. \nWorkload:\nLight. Required \"looking\" instead of required reading. Weekly on-line portfolios to look at with questions posed for class discussion. 4 3-page papers, midterm, final.

Her class can be a lot of fun, but she will make everybody work for it.  The LitHum class I took with her was by far my best experience with the Core.  More than any other class I took at Columbia it affected the way I read books to this day.\nMercer\u00c2\u2019s approach to philosophy is different from what you will encounter with most of the other Professors in the department.  As far as I know, there is nobody else in whose class you will find that philosophical insight is second to (or at least on an equal footing with) historical study.  While it is true that most of us philosophy majors did not choose our major with that sort of thing in mind, Mercer makes her approach interesting and engaging.  In part, she knows a tremendous amount and finds it so interesting herself, and, in part, because she will offer you an argument (if you are willing to listen) about why what she does is as important to the discipline as straight-up philosophical debate.  Mainly though, she makes it work because she is spectacular in the classroom.  Her lectures are informative and certainly held my attention, but I think she is one of the best when it comes to leading a discussion.  She gets people to say interesting things, and it is not just the usual suspects saying the usual, predictable stuff.  She gets all kinds of students involved because people feel compelled to participate.  \nProfessor Mercer takes a genuine interest in her students.  She won\u00c2\u2019t coddle you, and don\u00c2\u2019t expect too much sympathy if you feel talking without having much say, but she will listen if you are sincere.  She will also argue with you if she disagrees.  I found Prof. Mercer helpful as a departmental advisor (especially in comparison to what I heard about other departmental advisors).  She made the program flexible and seemed to be concerned that I get the most out of my course of study.\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nJust to respond quickly to the ridiculous polarity of these reviews..... I am a guy. I never said one thing in class. I took the class freshman year, with only one other intro class as my experience with Philosophy. I would say that this puts me somewhere in the middle of the rest of the reviewers- at the time of taking the class, I was certainly not a philosophy \"jock\" and expect to be one of her favorites, nor did I expect her to be a man-hating, cold, grade-ruining favoritist, as some of the reviews seem to imply. I never spoke to her enough to develop any sort of serious academic relationship during office hours, but I did go once. Like I said, I was somewhere in the middle, which most people, of course, usually are. So what do I think of her? \nWell, first off, Mercer gives off an aire of subtle arrogance, which some people take as her assuredness of brilliance or as a sign of some smug, deluded self-righteousness. \nOf course, this is Columbia, and most any professor teaching here with anything close to a \"prestigious\" position or history in their field is going to have a bit of an ego. Get over it. She's a professor, not a kindergarten teacher.\n In terms of favoritism, I would argue it's more the fault of annoying philosophy majors and certain others that either want to become her pet or see her as some sort of feminist beacon in the philosophy world. I don't think that she necessarily encourages this, but she will respond when you ask a question in class, and unfortunately, those are the people who generally tend to ask the questions. And she does not hate guys- if you are threatened by someone saying that there is no true philosophical basis for sexism, or think that feminism means women hating men and wanting to bring about their ruin, then you have some issues to figure out on your own that really don't have anything to do with what she says. I was never offended by her views with regards to gender/ feminism/ etc etc, and I am by no means a femisit activist or anything along those lines. \nAnd as to her grading policies- as some philosophy professors will, she allows you to write either in a dialectic or essay form, which is nice, since you don't have to be a philosophy major to write a critical dialogue. \nWith her grading- well, I didn't find any problem there, and thought she was thorough and fair. When I didn't understand a comment, I went into her office hours, and contrary to popular belief, she was warm, attentive, and responsive to my questions. \nEventually, with virtually no formal experience in philosophy, I got an A in the class. I was not one of her favorites, I am a guy, my GPA wasn't ruined, etc. etc. While I don't think that she is the most incredible professor I've ever had, she was great, and I enjoyed the class even though I hate the period in philosophy. I would definitely recommend you take her class, unless you are for some reason inclined to believe the extreme, often overly personal \"Oh my god this is the best/ worst class I've ever taken\" reviews or can't handle someone not holding your hand and softening up their words for you. \nWorkload:\nA couple papers. Fair grading. I barely read, but if you understand the underlying concepts, which she conveys well, then you'll do fine. \n"

Although Mercer made many attempts to enliven the class, her delivery seemed forced.  The conflict between dogmatic rationalism and empirical skepticism was frequently superceded by the conflict between pleasurable slumber and agonizing consciousness.  \nMercer seemed to be afraid of going too fast.  The result was a superficial discussion of the basic themes of the texts with repeated emphasis on basic points (for example, people use skepticism to undermine dogmatism\u00c2\u2026 duh), which left little time for discussion of the subtleties.  Also, the course left out a lot.  No discussion of monads or the principle of sufficient reason for Leibniz (especially strange considering she is a Leibniz scholar).  No discussion of Locke at all.  On the good side, Descartes, Hume, and Kant are covered well (principally because the readings for these three were the most extensive).  Mercer limited the class to metaphysics, which was a good choice since there is so much stuff during this period.  Also, Professor Mercer is incredibly nice and unbelievably accessible outside of class.  \nThere should be more reading in this course, especially for Bacon and Leibniz.\nWorkload:\n2 papers, midterm, final.
