There is an EXTREMELY demanding reading load for this class. Expect 250-500 pages of reading a week on a light reading week.\nHowever, if you are interested in learning about Latin American history, especially the eras of discovery, colonization and independence/ national identity formation, take this class.\nThe professor is extremely kind, knowledgeable and will help you develop skills. However, you just might kill yourself with the reading. It is insane!\nWorkload:\n1 Oral Presentation, 6 Formal Discussion Board Postings (2-3 page mini essays), 2 6 page essays, Midterm and Final, Massive Readings (250-500 pages of readings a week)\n"

She gives plenty of interactive exercises to make sure you understand all the concepts and will help you on a one-to-one basis if anything is unclear.

We played games, held discussions, wrote skits, analyzed a play (Bodas de Sangre) and short story (El Hijo y La Madre) in essay form and class was always fun. She really cares about her students and the material she's teaching. I would suggest visting her during office hours if you don't understand a concept or you just want to reinforce a topic. Marissa makes a 9 AM class enjoyable and fun!\nWorkload:\nHomework assingments every night out of the textbook or workbook(some can seem rather long), 3 or 4 two-page essays, approximately half a dozen quizzes a miderm and a final.\n"
