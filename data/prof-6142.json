            "review_content": "\nMaksim is a phd candidate from the slavic department. While the class is relatively easy, it is also extremely boring. Maksim is a nice guy but it doesn't seem like he wants to be there anymore than the students do. The entire two hour class passes by very slowly with maybe a handful of people talking each class and then a dead silence for the rest of the two hours. The one thing that annoyed me about the class was that Maksim would ask a question, a few people would answer, and instead of a discussion he would just tell us what the \"right\" answer to the question was.\nBut overall, a very easy class- he is a lenient grader. Didn't matter if you did the reading or not since there wasn't much discussion. \nside note- he doesn't care if you bring in a laptop. \nWorkload:\nTypical, 3 papers, long midterm that was graded easily and the regular final. \n"
