            "review_content": "\nAwful awful awful awful. First I thought the course would be interesting. Only midway did he decide to make us suffer and talk of topics that are in no way instructive on Congress, especially for people taking this as an intro to congress level (meaning talking about spatial theories of voting, and committee theories and so on). I am not American and wanted to learn about Congress, yet all I came to realize is that this class was just horrible and I truly learnt NOTHING.\nLecture: boring dry hard to follow not so much american politics, probably more of a mix between american politics and research methods/math methods for poli sci\nWorkload:\nThe amount of readings he assigns are preposterous. Around 13-15 chapters from 4 DIFFERENT books every two weeks. All books talk of the same thing so he clearly just wanted us to suffer even more and just assign four books on the same topics.\nExams:\nNit-picky IDs from readings. Truly NO ONE in the class answered a few that showed up on the exam because it was neither spoken of in class, or in the books (which I have on Kindle so I did a control+f, and nothing came up). So again, just a really ridiculous move on his hand.\nGrading: meh, ok not too strict, but then again you have to make sure to answer every part of every question and god forbid you forget to mention a tiny little bit you'll pose 1/2 the points.\nOverall: save yourself and your time and please do not take this class. I promise you will not learn ANYTHING about congress and just realize that you made a huge mistake\n\nWorkload:\nNoted above\n"

            "review_content": "\nI'm not sure what class some of the other reviewers took but Professor Wawro's American Congress course was as good as a survey course on Congress can get. Wawro is VERY knowledgeable on the subject and it is clear that he is on the cutting-edge of research on Congress. Take this class if you want not only general information on Congress but also insight into the newest theories. I can only see lectures as being boring to one with no interest in the American political system, in which case I do not see the point in taking a polisci elective. \nDespite the size of the class, Wawro also did a good job of encouraging participation, which made the 75 minute lectures go rather fast. The readings are well-chosen and interesting but not at all necessary. The midterm and final were almost completely based on lectures and if you take good notes and retain the information you'll be fine. \nThe research paper that's due on the last class is on any number of interesting questions that examine relevant current events in Congress. It's graded by TAs and not especially harshly. \nWorkload:\nReadings that are not necessary but interesting.\nA midterm and final that are essays and IDs.\nA 10-12 page research paper due on the last class. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThe other reviews of Professor Wawro might make you think his class is boring -- it's not, just about a dry subject that I think he did his best to teach. It's no doubt that he knows his stuff -- he published a book recently -- but it isn't ideal that he reads his lectures from pre-prepared notes because some of the more exciting and interesting facts came out when he wasn't reading. \nI will say that most of the class is very straightforward and not very challenging. There are four textbooks assigned, and the reading isn't entirely necessary most of the time. One of them had bolded terms at the end of each chapter that was good for review. I will say that I didn't study much for either exam and I did really well on both of them, as did most of the class. Although whether or not this is due to the incredibly generous grading or the entire class knowing the material (or both) may never be known. \nIf you're interested in Congress and want a light workload that you'll actually learn something from, take this class. Wawro's a cool guy and the TAs seem like they know their stuff. \nWorkload:\nVery little. One midterm, one final, and an 8-10 page research paper due at the last lecture. All graded very generously.\n"

Well, then you shouldn't come to lectures. However, the midterm and final IDs were waayyyy out of leftfield and were just obscurely mentioned in the readings. I really didn't like this class.

He's got a great, dry sense of humor and he presents the material in a straightforward manner. And if you go to class, you barely have to do the reading -- just skim it for the boldface words before the exams.\nHe also works really hard to make sure the class is relevant. When the financial crisis broke out, he suspended the syllabus for a few days just to discuss Congress's response, and one of the essay options had to do with the 2008 race. I'd definitely recommend the class to anybody remotely interested in current events or Congress.\nWorkload:\nMidterm, Final, and an 8-10 page paper\nIf you need a hand, talk to the TAs -- they're really helpful\n"

I decided to stick around for one more class and found myself pleasantly surprised by Wawro's style and wit. The material itself is interesting and, although Wawro could be less monotone, he actually has a very witty sense of humor. He'll definitely surprise you with a comment inserted in the middle of lecture (albeit in the same monotone voice) that will completely take you off guard but will definitely make you smile (or even chuckle). And he also presents the material in an easy to understand manner. You won't leave class being unsure about something that he said. Perhaps its not the most invigorating class, but it is a topic that is very pertinent and useful to know about today and Wawro doesn't do a bad job at presenting it (as the other reviews suggest).\nWorkload:\nIn class midterm, in class final during the designated time, 10 page research paper\n"

This course is lazily composed by the instructors, with no real thread except taking exciting topics such as the presidency and congress, then sucking any interest out completeley  by boiling them down into their constitutuent theoretical parts. It was a sad moment of the course when towards the end of the semester a professor of law guested, and was clearly much more interesting than either Erickson or Wawro. \nThey are not bad professors as such - but they don't put in enough effort to make it interesting, and if this is an introduction to american politics, for god's sake make it a little more relevent. I have nothing against theoritical political science as such, but by divorcing it from  'historical' analysis (eg, the news), there isn't a way in for interested novices.\nThere must be a better intro than this.\nWorkload:\nSlim - best thing about the course, as if that was a reccommendation!

I heard that it was really simple and straightforward but i found out that this guy isnt!  First of all I had the TA from hell.  Our class really studied for the midterm and he gave our disc section a avg of a 76!  I went to this guy's OH and he gave me the run around, you must make it plainly clear that you want an A.  From then on I got an A+ on the Final Paper and probably an A or something on the Final because I ended up with an A as a final grade.  But this didnt come without some anxiety.

His lack of care for teaching is only surpassed and further demonstrated by the fact that he never graded a single paper or exam the whole semester.  He didn't even show up to proctor any of the exams.  All work was done by his TA including teaching some of the classes.  His lectures are beyond boring and could be compared to anestesia.  The definition sections on the exams were taken from one line definitions that he threw at you in class and never revisited again, or from some obsure section of one of the boring required books.  The questions were never appropriate, pertinent or fair to the students even if they did all of the readings and attended every tedious lecture.  He is unapproachable outside of class and will not help you if you miss a class.  He has every lecture that he does in a slide presentation which he reads from verbatim in class, but will not share it with any of the students for fear that yet less will attend his stiffling classes.  If you want to work extremely hard for a terrible grade and be insulted, then take this class.  Columbia University should be ashamed to have him call himself a professor and should never have made the mistake of hiring him.  *CULPA censor*   I give this class and the professor an overall F\n"
