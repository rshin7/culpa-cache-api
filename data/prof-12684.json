She even had the class learn some dances that would go with the music being discussed. The tests are easy to study for because she gives out detailed study guides. Still, the memorization and listening involved for studying can take a long time. So, start studying more than a few hours before a test. Her grading is pretty fair although I think her comments on essays could be more thorough. \nWorkload:\nlight: 3 papers, midterm, final, attendance/participation\n"

Course reminded me of high-school. \nShe would take down essay points for using \"it's\" instead of \"it is\".\nShe was nervous and shaking during class, not really accesible afterwords. It was an awkward experience altogether.\nI wish school will not save money by letting inexperienced sub-par junior professors and graduate students learn to teach over our backs. In Riggs' case \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even that will not help.\nAgain, reminded me of my (bad) public high-school. Didn't learn anything of value.\nWorkload:\nSeemed average for music hum\n"
