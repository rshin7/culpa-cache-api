            "review_content": "\nI took both semesters of first-year Russian from Alison.  She was great!  She was enthusiastic and friendly, while remaining professional.  Introductory Russian, as Columbia chooses to teach it, is very demanding (at times ridiculously so), and could be overwhelming if you had a TA less supportive and encouraging than Alison.  I was impressed by the way she managed to balance the needs of brand new freshmen and seasoned (not to say cynical) upperclassmen.  She's a good person--highly recommended!\nWorkload:\nFirst-Year Russian is run like a Marine boot camp.  When they say to plan on an hour and a half or more of homework a night, believe them. \n"
