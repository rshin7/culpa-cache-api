Varzi's lectures are often tangential and really do not help at all. It got to the point where I just couldn't sit through an entire class, no matter how hard I tried. By the time finals came around, we were all scrambling to make sense of it all, and Varzi just couldn't do it. Like a godsend, Sebastian came along and taught a review session and it made so much more sense. He has an adorable accent, and he knows his material, and he's just really good at teaching this otherwise terribly convoluted class. If it weren't for him I surely would have failed. THANK YOU SEBASTIAN!\nWorkload:\nWeekly homework assignments, 2 midterms, 1 final.\n"
