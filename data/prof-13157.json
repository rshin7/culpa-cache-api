Ms. Wang, while a great human being and extremely intelligent, can't explain anything and is an inept teacher. \nThe prompts were never fully explained, a rubric was never really given, and guidance in any direction was never given at all. If you prefer that to structure, his might be a good class to take, except that even most free-form folk need to know what it is they're expected to write about. The problem is, the attempts at explaining the prompts were more confusing than the prompts themselves. A majority of the class was at a complete loss as to what to do/what was going on. Discussion involved three people spouting absurdities and everyone else trying desperately to understand what was going on. \nAll in all, if possible, switch.\nWorkload:\nStandard U. Writing essays, with the occasionally reading and the standard two (exploratory and actual) drafts prior to the essay being finalized. Not a hard class to keep up with. \n"
