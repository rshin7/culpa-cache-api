I took this class in the summer so it was 3+ hours starting at 9:30am - not only did I never fall asleep, but I don't think I ever even stopped paying attention. He is that good. \nHaving said that, if you are VERY familiar with American history, this class might be a little slow just because it is not as focused on the Presidency itself as I might have expected. \nEither way, this class is the kind of class I came to Columbia to take, and Eisenbach is a dude. \nWorkload:\nA shit-ton of reading, but you don't have to do all of it. The books are good anyway so I just read them and enjoyed. \nMidterm, Final, and Paper. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI completely agree with the post below. Not only did Eisenbach FAIL to show up to class on several occasions, but he also expected us to complete a midterm, 2 papers and a final ALL after spring break using material we never really went over or even read. He was an unnecessarily harsh grader, completely unavailable for meetings longer than 3 minutes, often failed to respond to emails (and if he did, they were always just a few, misspelled, jumbled words) and yet he expected everyone to participate in every class but didn't do anything to foster such participation. Most classes, he let just a few people dominate the class while he scribbled random, nonsensical words onto the board. The most frustrating  part of Eisenbach's class, in my opinion, was the way he constantly questioned every comment made in class with a \"so?\" or \"what are you trying to say?\" or \"what's your point?\" There was no way for a student to simply make a comment or an observation, because Eisenbach was always looking for an \"argument\" or a \"thesis\" of sorts. This made participation very awkward at times, and I don't think this is what anyone wants in a class like CC, where we're supposed to feel free to express our thoughts on the readings and different philosophies of life. How can you do that if your teacher always wants you to have a formed opinion before opening your mouth? All in all, avoid Eisenbach. That's all I can say.\nWorkload:\nYou don't really have to read, just sparknotes for the final. He likes it when people have quotes to talk about.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAh, what can I say about David. What can I not say about David. \nDavid Eisenbach may have once been an amazing teacher who was really attentive to his students and cared about them. Well, I can assure that this is no longer the case. David has recently had the pleasure of getting a television show to be aired on the H2 network, entitled \"10 Things You Didn't Know,\" that cover everything about American history from Wyatt Earp to Mormonism, with a completely random travel into Roman times (Caligula anyone?) \nI say all of this because on the whole, I've felt more interest in his show than in his CC class. Perhaps I'm just a little bitter from the fact that he missed class or cancelled EIGHT TIMES. That in itself wouldn't even be an issue but for the fact that he also expected us to be responsible for the material that we never read...um yeah right. \nWill he put material on his midterm/final about things that you didn't talk about? Hell yeah he will. If you do have the good luck that I've had to have him, make sure to pester him about when he will actually return your work, so that he can grade your paper while you take your midterm. Or so that you can even get your final from last semester back.\nI'm not sure if he is a difficult grader, but he does give slash grades, which are hard for me to fathom, particularly grades like B+/A- which don't actually correspond to real grades...89.5 perhaps?\nHe is still quite a lively discussion-monger, and his discussions are still going no further than the basic interpretation of the book. Which is fine, because we all figured out that this was one class that we were never going to read for. \nWorkload:\n2 papers, a midterm and a final. In order to participate, read at least 10 pages from every section and pick a favorite quote. You could choose to do the often hundreds-of-pages, but 1. we often get the assignment 2 days in advance 2. we end up fixating on one random thing anyway.\n"

Unfortunately, to really get out his true genius, one must do a bit of digging. He doesn't like to answer questions about his opinions very much but prefers to keep discussion going, which is great for discussion, but not-so-great if you really want to see him at work. \nI felt like a lot of this class was a teaser for his American Presidency class he teaches now and then. He has such a talent for drawing people's attention and keeping them entertained and stimulated that it's almost a shame that LitHum isn't a lecture course.\nA word of warning - though he was great to listen to when he occasionally spoke, because of the way he runs his seminar, the overall quality of one's experience will greatly depend on the people in one's class.\nWorkload:\nReadings, with the larger ones split over several days - these are not necessary to read cover-to-cover but well worth it in most cases; two 5-8 page papers; midterm; final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nHad him for LitHum a few yeas ago, so maybe he has changed his style.\nYes, he is engaging and energetic and looks like those hobo clown statuettes your grandmother has in her guest bedroom (well, mine does), but each time you looked back on each session, you realize he didn't really say anything after two hours.  By the second semester, I had checked out-- not because the texts were uninteresting, and I was actually very happy that he assigned us some Joseph Conrad-- but because nothing was happening in the class.\nDavid Charles keeps his discussion very safe-- and hey, I don't mind safe, because I think the basics are vital to use as a springboard for further discussion.  But we never got past that.  Yes, he explained some of the knottier parts of the readings, but that was done in the introduction of the books if you had bothered with it.  He kept calling on people who had stimulating comments like, \"It's because Achilles?  He was a warrior?\"  Okay, sure-- everyone should have their say, but to happily entertain such comments for 15 minutes as if it's something viable in the discussion makes for something more akin to spinning our wheels than striking forth into the magical world of deep and deeply felt textual investigation.  On  the other hand, if someone brought up something that was perhaps not quite what David Charles was trying to push but was still a logical, thought-out idea, he'd kind of skip over it and steer the conversation back to. . . whatever point it was he was making, usually one that got dragged on so long it had lost its meaning (\"Don Quixote and the church-- the church & DQ etc\" so by the end you thought, okay, it was the church, now what about it, did he mention that?)  If he didn't skip over the comment he would disarm whatever point the student was making by finishing the sentence for him.  This wasn't just when someone was bringing up something inappropriately off-track.  This was when somebody was suggesting an alternative after 20 minutes of talking about the same thing.  Basically, it feels like you are having a discussion because David Charles is so enthusiastic, but you're being tricked-- there was no discussion.  Just parroting and approved embellishments to DC's first point.  Nor is there discussion amongst the students.  Rather, it is Q&A;, with David Charles.\nAt other times, he would build up to something really awesome and incredible (according to his mounting excitement & demeanor, admittedly infectious) and then when nobody could guess exactly what it was, he would either never tell us or just go back to whatever general idea we were discussing.  We discussed, at one point. Coleridge, and after a fine, drawn-out monologue on how the wet hole is surrounded by hairy pine trees, he pointed at one of our sharpest classmates and said, \"And what would that be a metaphor for?\"  Now, you know everyone was thinking \"a vagina\" but when the kid said it, David Charles said, \"No!\" and never told us what the wet dark hole surrounded by pine trees could be indicative of in a poem talking about a pleasure dome.  That is really all we got out of Coleridge, or anything.\nOther times his humor would get in the way, making his statements confusing, and then he would take it out on the poor student he called on who thought that DC was either joking or saying something completely different.\nThat and we spent 30-50 minutes every Monday listening to what people did over the weekend, which on one hand was interesting but on the other hand was wasting precious time and money, I know now.  Though after awhile it was hard to tell whether you'd rather hear about the awesome times we all awesomely had or David Charles obliquely describe what was clearly not a representation of ladybits.\nThat said, I would assume from his energy that he is a great lecturer, and naturally he has some interesting things to say-- he is a smart man and thinks well on his feet and is usually articulate.  I almost wanted to take his presidents class just because of the topic but wasn't able to, or maybe scared myself off-- reading the reviews for that course looks like it was my mistake, because I can well imagine he would deliver a lively set of lectures.  On the other hand, it's frustrating to hear about other people's challenging and stimulating LitHum experiences & realize that all I got out of mine were anecdotes about other people's lives and about David Charles, and how he used his charisma to push a few themes that were not much more than surface readings-- so maybe I can say this-- if you are looking for something \"fun\" but not really challenging, where you can get a good grade once you figure out David Charles' system, go for it!  There's no shame in that.  On the other hand, if you aren't worried about your grade, find a harder section and actually get a good solid understanding to go with that not-inflated-B.\nWorkload:\nBasic papers, tough grading because he was \"fighting grade inflation\"-- which is at least a fair warning, but does not translate as helpful comments on papers or a clear indication of what kind of papers he expects.  Heavy reading.\nParticipation is essential, and he's pretty easygoing about attendance.\n"

The man might as well have lectured about himself for fifteen weeks instead of enlightening the class about the complexities of the modern American presidency.  \nThe American Presidency is not an intellectually challenging class by anyone's standards; rather, the true challenge comes in the form of vegetating through a lecture composed by a man who is so self-obsessed. Indeed, on various occasions Eisenbach touched upon a few enlightening points. Of course, those occasions did not occur until he took a break from staring at himself in the mirror. \nPerhaps I am being too harsh, but I am 99.099457% certain that Eisenbach possess the kind of ego that would drive a man to read about himself on Culpa. With that in mind, I hope he reads this and discovers that while he stands in front of the lecture hall and dreams about making out with himself, the rest of us are dying for some intellectual stimulation from his class.\nIf you want to learn about the American presidency, take Richard Pious.\nWorkload:\nDiscussions.

At times it seemed like a seminar, even though there were 100 kids in the class. When he teaches, it's almost like he's an actor or storyteller.

(I figured if i wanted to listen so bad i could probably handle the work.)  His classes were like storytime about the crazy things our presidents and CIA have gotten away with over the years (and also the things they haven't gotten away with...)  He can be pretty theatrical and likes to excite the audience with lots of crazy facts about the presidents.\nThis class has a few main themes, including the media and the presidency--who manipulates whom; and the expansion of the federal government and executive branch.\nWe also spent at least 10 minutes in the beginning of every class discussing the 2008 elections as they were happening, with lots of emphasis on youtube videos and the media narrative. \nSUPER interesting class, especially if you are interested in politics or American history. Take it!\nWorkload:\nAbout 200 pages of reading a week (a book a week, so sometimes more than 200 pages.)  Even Eisenbach said not to read the whole thing--he advised the class to read the beginning, the conclusion, and skim the middle for as much time as you can allot.  Depending on your TA, you don't even need to read the books.  They are useful in adding a historical perspective and more information to supplement the lectures, and you need to reference them for the exams.  The exams: one midterm, final.  The midterm had 5 out of 7 terms to ID and one essay out of two (in the essay you needed to reference three of the authors we read in class.)  The final will be the same, only two out of three essays.  It was VERY difficult and time-consuming to study for the exams, as Eisenbach mentions a lot of interesting but unimportant facts in his lectures, and the books contain so much information, it's tough to know what to study.  Also--one final paper (worth 30% of the grade).  12-15 pages about any issue you want, as long as you tie it in with a presidential campaign.  For a history class, i hear the work isn't too bad.\n"

Dave is awesome, and you'll leave his class really having discovered a lot about what you want to get out of both literature and life.  The true beauty of his seminar is that students are able to be themselves and discuss what matters to them, which under Dave's hairy and adroit hand will invariably include the texts and their most interesting implications.  Treated in a way that's reverent but without a hint of stuffiness, even St. Augustine becomes a vital tool that anyone in Dave's class could blow the proverbial dust off of and apply its wisdom and aesthetic to their own lives.  And that's the genius of Eisenbach: a welcome contrast to most other Lit Hum sections, the emphasis isn't on the texts themselves; it's on how they relate to you and your place as a guy or gal in the shitshow of modern society, which other instructers too often forget is after all the purpose of education.\nOnly complaints: a little lack of direction at times, and sparse comments on papers.  Also, starting at 9 AM sucked.

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Eisenbach (or, as he insists his students - er - friends call him, Dave), is a very kind and slightly odd species.  By the time you've experienced his seminars for a couple of weeks, you'll certainly feel fuzzy and amicable towards him, and probably towards your fellow classmates as well.  One will also come away with a pretty solid understanding of the texts so cursorily rushed through in the syllabus, though in less detail and depth than I think one could have.\nDave is clearly brilliant.  He has not only an extensive knowledge of the books (though not entirely without its holes), but also the ability to impart it upon our undergraduate minds.  However, this is one of the seminar's main flaws - ideas are simplified, sometimes to a maddening extent, and usually to a degree where some of the actual meaning is diminished.  Discussions under Dave - which take up the entire four hours of Lit Hum per week, save the first half hour, which you'll usually spend talking about your weekend - are usually productive and oftentimes revelatory, but nevertheless suffer from an interesting mix of deficiencies.  Dave generally espouses a very laissez-faire style, as the Core's main virtue is, after all, to teach students to generate their own knowledge.  While Dave's approach is conducive to this, it also means that prejudiced ideologues, verbose and pompous creatures, and vapid pseudo-intellectuals are overindulged.  When Dave does step in, he often does so to make a concerted effort is made to get everyone to participate (in the aforementioned spirit of the Core), which sucks because not everyone has something cogent to say.  He'll also occassionally intercede to steer the class' errant hive-mind back onto track, which is sometimes completely necessary, but it does result in his own views - at times, a bit anti-religious - being imposed upon the seminar.  On the whole, though, you'll look forward to going to class (tardiness is even allowed), and the two hours will fly by much more quickly than an hour of tortured lecture, courtesy of Eisenbach's gravelly sort of Jersey warmth.\nThe touchy-feely demeanor doesn't extend to Dave's grading predilections, though.  Well, it sort of does - he doesn't care about the typical conventions, or even if you include quotations to concretely support your assertions.  In fact, the quality of the writing is utterly superfluous in determining your mark, which is probably a positive thing, but it's certainly surprising, since this is a class based somewhat on literary analysis.  I suppose this mirrors the overall ethos of the class discussions, where - as in (all?) Lit Hum classes - close linguistic analysis is sacrificed for greater philosophical exegesis.  This is what Dave really cares about your presenting your ideas, backing them up (even vaguely, if you want), and relating them back to 'real life,' so as to add an explicit relevance to the entire endeavor.  I guess this is the point of education, so it's a noble goal, but expressed in this way, it seems a trifle artificial - especially when Dave doesn't tell students that this is mandatory, leading to an annoyingly needless (yet slight) reduction in grades.\nSo after my first semester of Dave, I'm essentially torn about the extent to which his class is worthwhile.  In comparison to most of my friends' Lit Hum , I'd characterize Eisenbach's seminar as a very good Core experience, but not a great one.  Given the immense difficulties associated with switching Lit Hum sections, and the capricious levels of pedagogy that pervade the rest of the department, I would say it's definitely worth it to stick with him.  If nothing else, you'll make a friend.\nWorkload:\nAs mentioned in the other reviews, light, but not extraordinarily so - two rather open-ended five- to seven-page papers per semester (the grading takes a little while to get used to), one midterm (I thought the IDs were tough, but fair), and one department-wide final (nothing to be afraid of).\n"

            "review_content": "\nDave is amazing.  I came to Columbia expecting to be a math major, and because of LIT HUM (of all classes) I'm planning on being an english major.  His class is extremely engaging and the hour and 50 minutes fly by faster than any 75 minute class I've ever taken.  It's basically an open-ended discussion, but he does tend to guide it in one way or another depending on what he wants us to get out of the texts.  Despite it being a 9am class, I never had a problem staying awake (plus he brings cookies in for you every morning so that you have a sugar buzz to stay awake).  You can say anything you want and get pretty tangential and it doesn't matter.  He's hilarious, and also understanding of the fact that some (or most) of the readings are not really that entertaining.  You can be completely honest about your feelings about the books (and even how much you read of them).  You don't have to read everything, sparknotes will more than suffice, and he will rarely to never call on you so you can get away with not speaking.  He grades fairly and consistently, but leaves minimal comments on papers.  I doubt anyone in the class got below a B, and I know many of us did absolutely none of the readings.  Also, he respects athletes... which many professors don't... so keep that in mind.  All in all, INCREDIBLE man, and if you have him you are soo lucky.  It's a damn shame he doesn't teach any other classes at Columbia.   \nWorkload:\n2 papers per semester (one 5-pager, one 7-pager), and only because that's the minimum required by the department.  You don't have to do all of the readings to get an A-/A on a paper, and extensions are no problem.  Midterm each semester comprised of ONLY passage IDs (10 first semester, 20 second semester).  Departament final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nDave Eisenbach is perhaps the coolest man on the planet. In addition to being phenomenally witty and down-to-earth, he also happens to be brilliant. He is hands down the best discussion leader I've ever had and always comes out with new and interesting ways to draw his students into the text. The man made Thucydides enjoyable, for God's sake! He returns e-mails promptly and is always willing to meet outside of class for further explanation of assignments, etc. I honestly can't imagine that a better Lit Hum professor exists on this campus. \nWorkload:\nIt's Lit Hum, so, A LOT of reading (especially second semester); two, count them, TWO 5-7 page papers per semester; midterm and final....WAY better than most sections\n"

            "review_content": "\nDave rocks. Although he sometimes pushes his own opinions in class or tries to force the class discussion towards his way of thinking, this happens less often than in any other english class I've ever taken. Every monday he asks the class what adventures we had over the weekend (and appreciates stories about wings and beer as well as stories about museums). What more could you ask for? Our class discussions have challenged a lot of the opinions and assumptions I came to this class with and gave me a broader perspective (sickeningly college-brochure-like, isn't it?). The only downside: he fails to make everyone participate, so there are always a few kids silent (falling asleep) in the corner. Don't be those kids! \nWorkload:\nThe reading is heavy. Wicked heavy. Just like every other lit hum section, you aren't going to get it all done. Dave is upfront about this, but you won't get much out of the discussion if you haven't done the reading. So spend the hours reading it, if you want your $40K's worth. \nPapers: eazee. we had two all semester; ok, so they were 7-9 pages each; so you have to stay up late two nights. no big deal and better than the 7 short papers other instructors assign.\n"
