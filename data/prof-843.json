            "review_content": "\nThis class was not particularly hard or interesting. The Professor generally lectures straight from the textbook so you are welcome to just read the textbook if you don\u2019t want to go to class. The problems in this class are fairly algorithmic; you usually just have to identify the type of differential equation and then use the provided technique to spit out the answer. The examples in class are usually useful to see how one should think about the problems, so I would recommend going to class over reading the textbook.\nThe answers to all the homework problems are in the back of the book which makes the homework average very high. The issue is that Panagiota is not always aware of what she put on the homework, so there might be problems from a section that was not explicitly covered in class, in which case you simply have to learn another formula and apply it to the required problems. Her exams are not particularly difficult, though there was one question from left field on both her first midterm and the final. \nOverall, this is a fairly straightforward class with a decent textbook and an alright teacher, but don\u2019t expect much from her in terms of email or office hours. \n\nWorkload:\nWeekly homework (usually < 2.5 hours, but ocassionally long), 10%\n2 midterms (fairly straightforward, barring one question), 25% each\n1 final (same as above), 40%\n"

            "review_content": "\nMy final impression of this course is a positive one. I found Daskalopoulos to be sweet and accommodating, and the class progressed at a reasonable pace. The majority of the classes were spent first deriving theorems/discussing techniques, and then going over a few examples. Perhaps sometimes she spent too long explicitly writing out each step of a proof, although I she certainly isn't painfully slow. She certainly knows the material and is able to answer any question confidently, understanding common pitfalls that many students have. While working through examples, however, she often makes many algebraic mistakes, although a handful of students who always seem to be paying very close attention always are there to correct her. She makes herself available and approachable, and was receptive to increasing, within reason, students' midterm grades who were graded by an unusually harsh TA.\nThe class itself certainly won't be your favorite math class at Columbia, with material being a toolbox of techniques, such that whenever you see a problem, you must only identify which technique is appropriate and the answer should produce itself. From class to class progress can seem slow, although at the end you do realize that you have covered many techniques.\nThe homework usually was a little more tedious than I would have liked. The examples from the book (Boyce & DiPrima) usually are not too polished, and will often have you writing many pages of algebra for certain problems. I found the problem sets always took between 3-6 hours a week, so it's not too bad. Having said that, if you do all the homework (which is worth almost nothing) you'll hardly have to study at all for the midterm / final. I thought those tests were extremely reasonable tests, with a perfect score being well within the reach of an attentive, responsible student. You should be familiar with all the aspects of the existence/uniqueness proofs, which apparently tripped up many students. The most helpful way to study for these tests, I found, is to make a study sheet that just lists all the different techniques you've learned and familiarize yourself with them before the test.\nWhile not too glamorous, ODEs with Daskalopolous is a pleasant, straightforward experience\nWorkload:\n3-6 hour weekly problem sets, worth 10%\nOne midterm (with a make-up midterm) worth 30%\nFinal 60%\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class was definitely not one of the better math classes I have taken.  I think most people were rather apathetic about the experience and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel too strongly about the course in either sense.  I found the course straightforward and easy to do well in, but less enjoyable and rewarding than other more challenging math classes that required more ingenuity.\nThe class follows the textbook by Walter Strauss extremely closely, covering chapters 1 through 7.  The lectures are so similar to the pages of the textbook to the point that the textbook was often a perfectly good substitute for attending lectures.  The lectures themselves are okay, but she does get confused and make mistakes on the board more often than would be optimal.  She is very often late to class, and end up rushing at the end and inevitably running overtime.  \nShe warned the class on the first day that this class is taught at a higher level than ODEs, with the justification that other departments offer more applied courses in PDEs.  This is not wrong, but I also found that this class was taught at a lower level of sophistication than most of the other math classes I have taken.  The class is mostly computational, as reflected by the proportion of the problems on homework and exams that were computations.  A small number of short proofs are presented in  lecture (and the textbook), and most of the proofs on homework and exams were simple variations of the proofs from lecture.  For the exams, remembering the proofs from lecture should be enough to complete those problems. \nThe weekly homework assignments were pretty long, with most having around 10 problems from the book.  Most of the problems are straightforward, though a few are more challenging, and many are quite heavy computationally.  Some of the problems just seemed like filler.  I think a lot of students used online solutions to complete the homework assignments.  I ultimately think the homework assignments were a negative in this class because grading was extremely slow, with some assignments taking as long as a month to be returned, and solutions were not posted until immediately before the exams. \nI found the exams very straightforward and reasonable.  Most of the questions on the exam testing the material in the most straight-forward way possible.  Some of the questions were simple tests of whether you remembered a definition/formula/proof, and these things were easy to pick out when studying because she never asked anything remotely obscure.  \nWorkload:\n20% Weekly Homework Assignments\n30% Midterm Exam: Average was 77, with a large number of students scoring between 90-100\n50% Final Exam\n"

She's very approachable during office hours and always responded to my emails in a timely manner.\nI got kind of sick of the class after a while because it kind of seemed like a recipe book we were memorizing - different methods for solving different types of ODEs. There wasn't much depth, in my opinion.\nThe questions on the tests were either incredibly easy or quite challenging. She LOVES to pose nonconstant coefficient problems, which aren't covered too extensively in the course, so that was pretty nerve-wracking. Make sure you're comfortable with them...\nAlso, though Linear Algebra is a co-req, I was taking it at the same time and when we got to the section in ODE about linear systems, which involves eigenvalues and diagonalization, we hadn't yet covered that in Linear Algebra, so I had to teach that to myself ahead my Lin Al class. Not too difficult, but not optimal. She also expected us to know a proof which involved a double integral (and I haven't taken Calc IV yet), but she didn't end up asking about it on the exam.\nIn terms of the theory on the exam, it's always pretty elementary stuff that she goes over in class. As long as you take notes and know your notes, you'll be fine.\nWorkload:\nTedious but not huge weekly problemsets.\nEasy midterm that everyone seemed to get in the 90s on. She said she didn't realize how easy it was...\nAverage for the final was a 70 I think.\n"

She is your standard Columbia Math dept professor who does not care too much about teaching undergrads.  She'll keep on going through class whether you understand it or not.

Her experience teaching this class showed in her explanations and also answering all questions during class. I considered the lectures clear given how difficult the material is. I did well in my calculus classes, but ODE is a step above. Computations can be very long and complicated for some types of problems. Also, She went over some additional proofs that I think were skipped in the engineering version of the class. These were a little rough. But the book also explains everything and helped me out a bit.\nShe is very accessible during her office hours and very patient with all the questions. \nLike a few other professors, she had one or two questions on her tests that were slightly extended from her lectures and homework. However, even those were just other problems from the end of the problem set in the book that weren't assigned.\nWorkload:\nweekly homework, midterm, final.

            "review_content": "\nProf. Daskalopoulos is wonderful!  I had a great time in her class, and I have definitely learned a lot.  I do want to stress, though, that this class is difficult and time-consuming (due to the subject matter).  An applied math major, I spent an average of 15 frustrating hours a week doing homework.  I also found the first couple week's homework to be the hardest, so hang in there.\nHowever, Prof. D definitely realizes the complexity of the material and does her best to accommodate.  She proceeds at a very manageable pace through the material, keeping to the book so that you can review the material easily.  While technically this also made her lectures skip-able, I found myself attending each one because she is a decent lecturer.  Her accent is slight, and I got used to it after a few classes.  She was also very open to questions, both in office hours and in class.\nThe book we used was by Walter Strauss, and while it was somewhat condensed, it was still easy to read and review.\nCompared to the homeworks which I found very difficult, the exams were much more straightforward.  There were no curveballs.  There was one proof on the midterm and a couple on the final, but these were the short ones in the book/homework, so you would do well to review them (there were really only 5 or so proved theorems overall, so it's not much to memorize).  The rest of the problems were computational.  \nOn a final note, the grading was more than fair.  The TAs always gave a good chunk of credit for having the right idea of how to solve a problem, even if the final answer was not correct.  Also, I thought that the final curve to be generous although to be fair I am not sure what the general distribution of the class was.\nOverall, I would highly recommend this class with Prof. D!\nWorkload:\n12 homeworks (one per week), midterm, and final.\n"

For someone who lectures straight out of the book, I found it completely frustrating that she threw us so many curveballs on the exams. Her tests feel completely disconnected from the (much more computational and straightforward) material at hand, and the final introduces things we don't cover in class.
