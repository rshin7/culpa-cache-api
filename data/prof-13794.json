            "review_content": "\nQuite literally one of the worst classes I've taken at Columbia. There is no feedback on anything that you submit, the professor never gives you an answer when you ask a question, and I came out of this class learning virtually nothing. Professor also doesn't even reply to e-mails on time. This stuff could be learned from a 2-week online edX course honestly. The TA's are really nice, but they can only do so much. The prompt was incredibly nebulous and because everything is group-based it's hard to actually coordinate or show your individual contribution. You'd think that for such a messy course the grading would at least be lenient, but no, there's just an arbitrary letter grade assigned that you have no idea what it will be until it hits your SSOL. \nWorkload:\nNot too heavy.. maybe 5 hours/week. Varies based on deadlines.\n"
