Her presentation of materials is concise and she usually goes over each concept twice, and they build on top of each other. She's a clear lecturer and her slides are pretty in-depth. She's always available for help outside the classroom as well, as are the TAs. Some TAs are hit or miss as they're undergrads.\nWorkload:\n5-10hrs/week, mostly on the coding assignments. If you're a CS major, they're medium-hard, otherwise I think you'll spend a whole lot more time than that on them. The conceptual homeworks are a breeze if you attend the lectures.\n"

            "review_content": "\nHands down the most annoying class I've taken so far. A lot of students are saying this is an easy class but I have to respectfully disagree. I will agree with one thing from other reviews: Prof Ansaf is a really nice person.\nGrading literally took ages, with no communication from the TAs or the Prof on why it took nearly a month to get our assignments graded. This made it difficult to see what I needed to work on, and also strategize if I should skip the last assignment or not (since the lowest assignment is dropped).\nThe Head TA for this semester was, to put it nicely, rude. That is the nicest word that comes to mind based on their class-wide announcements and personal interactions. I'm sure they're smart and are very knowledgeable on the subject matter at hand - but their communication skills when interacting with students are poor.\nThat said.. there are some things I really enjoyed:\nGenerous final grade, +2 pts if you submit something on time, implementation of Python coursework is a great addition to the course, allowing 'coding group' to work on a coding assignment together was a great way to meet new people in a virtual environment.\nCaveat: I took this class in Fall '20 in the middle of the pandemic. While I faced a heavy workload due to this course I'm sure the teaching staff did as well.\nWorkload:\nSo you're talking 10 assignments a week, which takes about 2 hours at the minimum (except the first one - should take < 1 hour), then watch the recorded lectures in 2x speed so maybe 1.5 hours a week on that, then maybe another hour a week for looking up YouTube videos on stuff you didn't get, also 4 coding assignments roughly 3~4 hours. \nMidterm and Final which was (as evident by the class averages) extremely challenging.\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nAnsaf is one of the kindest professors you\u2019ll meet at Columbia, but she\u2019s a mediocre teacher; she\u2019s too prone to glossing over the meat of the material. Everything you need to know can be easily found in the lecture notes she posts at the end of each week, so attending lectures is pointless. I think attendance trickled down to 20-30 students after the midterm.\nI will say that the course felt rushed near the end. Discrete was recently bumped up from 3 credits to 4 credits because the syllabus was revised to add more targeted prep for classes like AI. However, it\u2019s clear that Ansaf was not ready for this change. We went through the first three chapters at a snail\u2019s pace before the midterm, and then Ansaf had to cancel a full week\u2019s worth of lectures because she got COVID. As a result, the second half of the semester felt strapped for time, and we blitzed through the rest of the material. It got to the point where I don\u2019t feel adequately prepared for classes that require Discrete as a prerequisite even though I got an A in this class.\nOn the TAs: it seemed like most of them were TAing for the first time. Piazza posts took forever to get answered, and it usually took a few weeks for graded work to be returned. I never attended their Friday recitations, but the problems they made were generally harder than the homework or exams. Being able to solve these problems means that you truly understand the material, so be sure to do them if you know you\u2019ll need Discrete in the future.\nAt the end of the day, I\u2019m not sure if I can recommend Ansaf\u2019s version of Discrete. It\u2019s one of the easiest classes at Columbia and doesn\u2019t require a ton of work, but don\u2019t expect it to sufficiently prepare you for higher-level math or theoretical CS classes. If you have the option of testing out, I think doing so and taking a more advanced course in its place would be a better use of your time unless you desperately need the GPA boost.\nWorkload:\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Ansaf offered several opportunities for extra credit during Fall 2020. Submitting homework before the deadline awarded you 2 bonus points for that assignment, and everyone received at least 4 bonus points on the midterm. If she keeps this system, I wouldn\u2019t expect much of a curve (but it\u2019s likely that you won\u2019t even need it). All lectures and recitations were recorded, and both exams were asynchronous.\nWritten HW (35%) - There were 10 and the lowest was dropped. The assignments before the midterm were a bit longer and more tedious, but the ones after the midterm were much shorter. None of the questions were difficult though.\nPython Coding HW (15%) - There were 4 and the lowest was dropped. All of them were straightforward and easy to implement.\nMidterm (20%) - Fairly easy. It covered propositional logic, basic proofs, and set theory. She allowed us to use a double-sided cheat sheet.\nNon-Cumulative Final (30%) - Also easy. It covered relations, functions, number theory, counting, probability, graph theory, and all proof techniques. Instead of a cheat sheet, she allowed us to use any document that she had posted on Courseworks (i.e. homework/recitation solutions and her typed lectures notes).\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis was a great class. Ansaf is an excellent professor and cares a lot about her students. I took the fall 2020 version of the course which was entirely online.  Ansaf did a terrific job adapting the course to an online format.  \nI am talented at math (A+ in the course) but still got a lot out of the course.  I think prior reviewers do future students a disservice by saying the class is too easy.  \nSo here are the exam stats for my semester: midterm average was 88.6 and the final exam average was 78.4.  Clearly many students struggled with the material on the final exam.  It was a very fair exam -- my point is that the class is not trivial if you really want to master it.     \nSome students have said that it is easy to hurt your score by making a careless mistake. The class is not akin to a heavy computational Ordinary Differential Equations course where a single mistake is easy to make and will throw you off. If you are making mistakes on the problems in this class, you generally do not have a perfect understanding of the concepts. And these are key concepts in mathematics.      \nIf you actually pay attention in lecture, read the notes, and also read the text (the Scheinerman text is solid), you will learn a few important concepts even if you have a solid math background.  And these are very key concepts in math.  The coding assignments are good Python practice. \nEven if you place out of the course, I would recommend taking it.  It's a very crucial course in one's intellectual development and it's enjoyable.    \n\nWorkload:\nEach week we had a written assignment (10 total), 2 lectures, and 1 recitation.  We had 4 coding assignments.  And then a midterm and final of course.  If you want to master all of the material, the course does take time but not an inordinate amount of time.  \n"

Nonetheless, if you want an easy A, take this course.\nWhat really irked me more than anything though was the TAs. It seemed like they did not communicate at all with one another. Frequently, you would get two completely different answers if you went to two different office hours. Furthermore, the grading was sooooo slow. I get that TAs are also students but most of these exams were multiple choice and the coding is run through an autograder... so taking three weeks to grade the assignment is a bit of a letdown.\n\nWorkload:\n2 hours a week on psets (+2 hours if there's a coding that week)\n3 hours a week in class\n3 hours studying for midterm/final.\n\n"

Really, despite all the comments written below I still think that it is unfair to moke professor only because she is a naturally kind person. She was always approachable and her course was extremely well organized.\nOrganization:\n- first of all, you can see all the topics she is going to cover on courseworks from the very first day of the class\n- you can also see the dates of upcoming exams/midterms to organize your schedule (you may think that it is always the case but once you get more experience with Columbia, you may realize that it is NOT)\n- there were always availability of lecture notes handwritten and typed (also very helpful and rare at Columbia)\n- there are two books for this class which cover all the material but students usually do not notice the existence of the second one: it is only for \"inference topic\" but you do not have to buy it. All of them are always available at the library \nOHs:\nI personally never went to OH and I cannot say anything about TAs for this class, but the overall organization was so great that I even didn't have to! Everything was in books and lecture notes. \nExams:\nMidterms were great: you can have a cheat sheet with formulas you may forget. Then you do not need to study formulas: you basically have to UNDERSTAND the material. Moreover, it consists of numerous small problems: it never happens that the problem is worth 40-50-60% of the exam (as it happens in other classes: but you realize it again only with more experience at Columbia).\nThat is why when you cannot solve something - you still will be fine.\nOverall feeling:\nIt was the only course where you didn't need to stress out and be scared as hell before exams if you missed a lecture because everything was organized so well that another student even didn't need to go to a lecture. Probably, that is why everybody decided not to attend lectures and then to complain.\nTeaching style:\nThis class is big: one section is around 150 students. And it is always hard to explain material if there are so many people. \nIf you go to the lecture and keep attention to what the professor explains - you will definitely enjoy her teaching style.\nIf you stay in the last row and spent half of the lecture on facebook - you probably will not enjoy her teaching style.\nThat is why to enjoy this class I would suggest to go to the lecture and try to listen to the professor, to attend her OHs: \nit is the only way you will really enjoy the Discrete. Believe me, Ansaf is great: you just have to keep attention to what she is saying. \nIn any case, if compared to other classes, you always will be well equipped with all the materials needed.  \nWorkload:\nDepends on your background: can be very easy if you have one or hard if you don't have\nHowever, all the prerequisites are written in syllabus \nAssignments (40%):10 assignments. \nExams (55%): 3 in-class midterms\nParticipation in class (5%)\nAs far as I know, the class was changed and now it is the following formula:\nAssignments (~40%)\nCoding assignments (~10%)\nMidterm  (~25%)\nFinal (~25%)\nThey added coding and I find it amazing. \nPython is really needed for AI class but the only class offering it before AI is COMSW1012, \nwhich you have to take before Java Intro if you are unfamiliar with coding.\nIf I could, I would like to take this class again:)\n"

Although she does post power point slides summarizing what she teaches in lecture, they are a fair amount of helpful examples that she goes over in class which are not included in the power points. These in-class examples are also closely aligned with what she puts on the exams. The overall consensus within the department is that Ansaf is a nice person, but a so-so teacher. This is true. Her lectures were average in every respect: organization, clearness, etc. I was a student that always asked questions in class and she was always willing to stop what she was doing, unlike other professors, to answer my question and make sure I understood. \nHomework: Took me about 5-7 hours for every homework assignment. If I got stuck, I would go to the TA office hours for help\u2014at OH, the TAs (at least the ones I went to) were incredibly helpful and often just gave me the answer. Homework is doable if you pace yourself, ask for help from your friends/TAs at OH/TAs on Piazza. \nExams: The exams are EASIER than the homework, and as I said before the questions on the exams are closely aligned with the ones she goes over in lecture (again, go to lecture). \nOverall, I would recommend this class.

She was incredibly personable, and always had time during her office hours to help or chat. \nSo...I didn't think this was a good class. I know a lot of seniors took this class because it was supposed to be relatively easy where you still learned a lot. Unfortunately, neither of those were true this semester. This could be because this is the first time in two years that this course has been offered, or perhaps because she (very nicely) expanded the class to 275 students, so there was less one-on-one time with instructors. As it was, the Professor would show up late (despite her best efforts) every class because of a meeting directly prior to class. That's unfortunate, because it means the first 5-15min of class were used for setting up instead of lecturing. I think if the Professor knew she would be teaching a class at 1:10pm, she should have scheduled her meeting for another time (or vice versa). \nAdditionally, the class was incredibly disorganized. The homework instructions were generally incredibly vague and because of that on Piazza there would be -- I kid you not -- 50-80 unanswered piazza posts during homework times. The homeworks were also badly managed, as they were more rushed in deadlines towards the end of the semester. Also, there was a time where a homework was due the same time as the midterm, which was incredibly distracting and in my opinion badly managed. Considering how much time the homeworks took, it was relatively disorganized schedule-wise.\nThe exams weren't much better - instead of testing the actual content of the class slides/lectures, they tested your speed in problem solving. If you're able to do each problem in about a minute to 5 minutes you'll be fine -- but that was not typical. If you take the exams, I recommend that you first focus on the highest weighted problems first -- aim for the max points in the least time, not about going in depth. The practice problems are good for general formatting, but not on timing. If the professor had added more practice problems for exams I think that would have helped. \nFinally, the TAs were generally useless. Of the about 10 TA's, all of whose office hours I went to, only about 3 were consistently able to answer my questions and help me on my homeworks. Jimmy/Ruicong was the best TA so I hope he stays on if this class gets taught again. \nIn general, I wouldn't take this class again. I didn't feel like I learned anything, and the homeworks were just implementing algorithms in a really convoluted way. \nWorkload:\n1 Midterm - 20%\n1 Final - 30%\n5 Homeworks - 50%\n"

Full disclosure: I got an A in this class, so this isn't just whining.\nProfessor Ansaf is super nice but incredibly disorganized. She never showed up to class on time, and every class had \"technical issues\" that would last the first 15 minutes of lecture time. Furthermore, when she would teach, it would be rushed and very high level, when what you needed to know on the exams and homework were much more detailed. Again because of her disorganization, the first half of the class was very laid back - there was very little work and only two homeworks. Then, for some godforsaken reason she decided to assign homework 3 (the 2048 game, in my opinion, the hardest homework because of the necessary optimization problems) and have the midterm two days apart. It was endless sleepless nights because the homework took so goddam long and so did studying for the midterm. Her practice exam was only slightly helpful, and neither were her lectures for the midterm.\nSide note: her exams don't test knowledge. They test speed. The midterm exam was absolutely ridiculous because it had about twice as many questions as were possible to answer in that time period. It was super frustrating, especially since none of the students knew that coming in, so a lot of people absolutely bombed that exam when we actually knew the content. When I went to talk to her about it, she said she wasn't going to help because everyone was graded on a curve. Okay, thanks for that nonexistent help. \nFinally, the last half of the class was incredibly rushed, because she realized she hadn't taught any of the topics she needed for the homeworks. So instead of giving us time for the assignments by spacing them out, she instead gave us an assignment every week. The homeworks are incredibly time-consuming (because you always have to optimize over and over again) so you barely had any time at the end of the semester to do anything. Finally, the final again was ridiculous. \nAll I can say is that I hated this class. Professor Ansaf was disorganized and there were only 1 or 2 TAs that were actually helpful. In essence, take this class only if you're prepared to learn everything on your own, and get no support from the professor besides a curve. \nWorkload:\n5 Homeworks - 50%\n1 Midterm - 20%\n1 Final - 30%\n"

Lots of partial credit on exams as well. Overall pretty easy class.\nHowever, the actually teaching quality has a high variance. I think she does a fine job of explaining stuff, but she goes extremely slowly and there is almost 0 value to actually showing up to class, when you can just skim the entire week's powerpoints in 20 minutes and have caught up on the material. \nOverall, I would definitely recommend this section.

Jessica Ouyang taught a concurrent section the semester I took the class, but she was less popular simply because she offered those things and people (including myself) were too lazy and just wanted to get out of a requirement. \nWorkload:\nvery light. 1 homework every 10 days. Homework takes about 5 hours to complete. 3 midterms (20% * 3 midterns + 60% HW grade)\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf Ansaf is very friendly and the class was interactive. There was a good balance of traditional AI topics such as agents, search algorithms, CSPs and logic with a focus on machine learning in the second half of the semester. The prof mainly used her slides but there were some chalk board sessions as well. The slides were very well prepared and Prof Ansaf takes you through the math in a very simplified manner. The slides are sufficient and the text book can be used for any reference reading.\nThere were four assignments and all of them had Python programming. Basic programming knowledge is sufficient for this class as Python is easy to pick up. There was a Python recitation taken by one of the TAs in the beginning of the semester and it was very helpful to get started. The assignments were interesting (application of AI to games like 2048, mazes etc) but time consuming - as you can keep trying to improve the performance of your program. Definitely the best way to understand the intricacies of the algorithm though and the prof was kind enough to give additional time on the assignments when required. There were a lot of opportunities to score extra credit if you needed to catch up on a bad performance. We had one quiz and a lot of suggested reading material if you were interested. The course covered a lot of topics - AI and ML related. But the midterm and final were both open notes so you could focus on application rather than memorizing formulae or algorithms. The exams definitely made you think but as long as you understood the content it, the problems were solvable. The final grading formula was very generous and took the best performances into account for most students.\nThe TAs were helpful during office hours and on Piazza. Especially close to exam time, the response time of the prof on Piazza was great which helped a lot.\nThe professor balanced heavy course material with lighter \"historical moments of the day\" and current events in AI which made the two and a half hour class easier to get through. We also had a guest lecturer in the last class. All in all the professor really cared and took great initiative to give us more information than strictly the course content and made the classes more fun.\nWorkload:\nWeekly lecture 2.5 hours + 4 Python programming assignments (45%) + Class participation (5%) + Midterm/Final Exam (50%) + lot of opportunities to score extra credit.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI took this AI class with Ansaf. I like her teaching style and her class. She focus on the searching algorithm and machine learning for most time which are quite interesting to me. It is not easy to cover all the machine learning algorithms in less than half semester so that she taught a little bit fast in the machine learning part. The after class studying will be necessary if you want to grasp these algorithms. I also like her homework. She have assigned four homework, all programming in python. Most of them are very practical problem(for example to program a AI for 2048 game) and some of them are very challenging. \nIt is hard to say the importance of this class to me. Honestly I expect more in this class because firstly I have taken machine learning before and I want to have a systemic understanding about how to build up an AI. But after taken this class, what I have learn and what I can understanding is not clear enough. I cannot say that I have a clearly and systemic understanding about how to build up a practical AI. Maybe it is because the artificial intelligence is a quite wild field that cannot be cover by only one class in one semester. If I can arrange the topics in this class, I will set this class as a higher level class and the machine learning class should be required before this class. Then the professor may discuss more in AI rather than take most of time to discuss machine learning and algorithm. \nAll in all, Ansaf is a quite instructive teacher. For those students who haven't taken machine learning before, this class is very useful and you can learn a lot in this class.\n(written by Z.H.)\nWorkload:\n4 homework+1quizz+1midterm+1final\nThe overall aggregation is as follows: \n45% *HW  +   5% * participation_class +  50% * MAX(midterm,final)\n"
