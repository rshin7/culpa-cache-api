            "review_content": "\nProfessor Monk is a great lecturer, although honestly half her lectures aren't even her lecturing. She has a LOT of guest speakers. Which isn't bad, per se, but some of them are much better than others. Unfortunately, it's hard to discern which of them are going to be good/informative/useful beforehand, so you'll just have to take them as they come. And yes, a lot of their material shows up on the exams, which, let me just say, bring some of the most intense information cramming that you've ever had in your life. Yes, these exams are hard core. Study study study, you honestly cannot study enough. \nOverall though, if you do your part, this class is good and rewarding. I feel like the TAs (who do all the grading and review sessions, Monk is clearly too busy for that) are fair about the exams, and will acknowledge when you know you're stuff. The questions get a little nitpicky, but at the end of the day they're not too awful. I feel like I actually learned something in this class, which is more than I can say for a lot of psychology classes I've taken here. \nLike I and others here have said though, Prof. Monk does NOT have time for you. She seems like a sweet woman, and she knows her stuff, but she also does research and has her own therapy practice. This makes her lectures really practical and interesting, but it's also clear that teaching is not really her first priorities. She picked good TAs though, who were generally pretty responsive\u00e2\u20ac\u201dalthough they definitely varied in competency. Oh well. \nGenerally, if you're a psych major, I definitely recommend this class. Or if you're really interested in the subject.\nWorkload:\nThree exams including the final. Really intense in terms of information, since she assigns a lot of reading from the book. A LOT. Plus a few PDFs on CourseWorks which are annoying, and you definitely have to know them for the exam. \n"

            "review_content": "\nHer lectures are fun and I looked forward to them, however there's just much too much material packed into this course, and her TA's are ridiculous-- you can honestly take an exam and deserve a 90 and they'll without fail ALWAYS find a way to find extremely minor problems with SOMETHING you wrote and give you a 75 or so instead. Professor Monk also seems to love what she's teaching, but does not seem very happy when students go to her office hours to ask questions, unless they are pre-clinical.  \nWorkload:\nYou'll hate the textbook, and there's lots of reading assigned from it. The articles she chooses to put on courseworks and assign for homework, though, were mostly really good. Three exams that are horrible. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThough Professor Monk's availability outside lecture both in terms of time (one strictly maintained hour for office hours!) and energy due to the multiple professional hats she wears, she is an engaging, talented communicator. Her lectures not only organize and highlight key elements of the reams of factual material involved in a survey of abnormal behavior, but also provide useful thematic axes along which all this factual informnation can be organized. She makes no secret of her disdain for biological determinism, which frankly is constructive in this age of patient overmedication, nor of her predilection for object-relations interpretations of psychopathology, but again, it is an important counterbalance to today's overhyped trends in the field, which are covered amply by the text. Strongly recommended, but avoid attempting to get too close to Monk - she has no space for it.\nWorkload:\nHeavy. Exams are entirely based on recall, rather than recognition, so START EARLY with encoding the lectures and the text (or lecture content outlined along the lines of the text, supplemented by the text's own key terms and major models!). Otherwise the essay prep will soak up your study time and short answers will be a disaster.\n"

            "review_content": "\nOverall, I enjoyed Dr. Monk's class.  I took it in the Spring of 2007.  I found the lectures very interesting, as well as the readings.  This class covers a lot of material.  From developmental psychology to an extensive review/critic of the DSM, to adult psychiatry/psychology.  Dr. Monk is extremely enthusiastic about the subject, and her own clinical experience makes the class even more interesting.  I would say that the exams are mildly difficult.  They require a lot of memorization, and are based on the lecture slides, the book, and the readings.  You have to do the readings!  They will absolutely end up all over the exam.  The only problem with this class, which to me was a big problem, are the TAs.  Their grading system is terrible.  If you do not write the answers down exactly as they are written in the slides/books you will get major points taken off.  If this happens to you, make sure you go and talk to the TAs after class about their grading.  They actually will give you back points for their ridiculous grading.  I found that the TAs were not as well-educated in the psychology field as they should have been.  They were by far the worst TAs I have had in my 3 years at Columbia.\nAll this said, if you like psychology, you will love the topics in this class and Dr. Monk.  I would not recommend it just to fill a science requirement.   \nWorkload:\n3 comprehensive exams.  Possible essay topics are given ahead of time, of which she will choose 2.  Last exam is short answers only.  The short answer questions are not easy, and concentrate on details, so make sure you do not spend all of your time studying for the long essay questions.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf Monk's is a good professor and presents the material in an interesting way, following the textbook pretty closely, which is fitting for a lower-level course. She does spend a bit of time emphasizing that psychology is NOT biological determinism but I think that this is only natural in light of the emphasis that recent years have seen on the importance of genetics rather than other influences. Furthermore, prof Monk is readily available to talk outside of class and she is extremely warm and patient and in fact it is patience that is her flaw.\nPro Monk allows the class to wander way too much with inane questions, comments, philosophical musings etc. of any moron who likes to hear him or herself talk. If there is a reason to not take this class, it is because you have to suffer through listening to idiotic peers talk rather than Prof Monk. You sit there and marvel at the fact that some of these people are actually considering being psychologists and then realize why so many people have had negative experiences in therapy. \nFinally, Monk starts every class off with music and is always looking for new music. Her taste is highly variable, mostly good and she is open to suggestions.\n\nWorkload:\n2 exams that were very specific and surprisingly difficult that you needed to read the text carefully to do well on, and a final that was moderately easier\n"

You will waste your time listening to inane never-ending questions of people who are taking this class to fulfill their science requirements.  Professor Monk is a sweet lady who does not want to offend anyone, so she spend 5-10 minutes giving elaborate answers to the questions that could have been answered just by reading the textbook.  She is really good at explaining things but you never finish the lecture, nor do  you get to learn much, because some inconsiderate people ask 3-4 questions each, therefore slowing everything down.  The textbook is fun to read but the exams are not that well-written.  \nWorkload:\n2 midterms and one final, worth 50%.  Despite other people's statement that it is understanding that is being checked on the exam, in my exprience you do better if you memorize stuff since TAs are looking for particular pattern of words, and if they are absent while the same content is present, you will have points taken off.\n"

The information is very interesting but Professor Monk just rehashes what the book says over and over again with a tremendous overemphasis on psychoanalysis, making it difficult to understand all of the types of therapy and treatment options. She is not the worst in the psych dept, but most certainly does not deserve the glowing reviews she has been given. I am not saying that people should not take this class, I am just saying be forewarned that it is not the sunshine and rainbows that everyone thinks. \n"

Prof. Monk's passion for the material and for teaching in general (she is also a practicing clinician and a researcher) are clear, and I felt that she really wanted us to understand what we were learning. She supplements her power points with plenty of clinical anecdotes, and she brings in specialists to give guest lectures. My only gripe is that she took about a million questions from the over-eager post-bacs, and often had to rush through the end of lectures as a result. \nI've taken four psych classes and this was my favorite, whatever that means. Also, to all neurotic Columbia students, have fun diagnosing yourselves with various anxiety and mood disorders. \nGet to class a few minutes early and reap the benefits of Prof. Monk's eclectic taste in music (at 9 am, it actually helps). \nWorkload:\n3 comprehensive tests: short answers and essay (the 3rd was only short answer). She hands out 3 essay topics ahead of time, and one of them is on the exam. This is a really effective way of getting us to learn the material in depth. I think I'll actually remember a lot of what I learned in this class, and unfortunately, that isn't the usual.\n"

Some guest lecturers are better than others. If the subjects intrigues you, definitely take this course.\nWorkload:\nThe grading issues people had in previous years have been addressed.

For those of us who have witnessed psych dept professors counting down the minutes until class is over so that they can conduct their research this class is truly a breath of fresh air.  Monk's passion for the subject matter and her ability to weave the textbook, research articles and real-life clinical expereience into her lectures is genuine and intellectually minded.   Even if it is at the ridiculous hour of 9 am.  Dr. Monk is one of the few Columbia Professors with clinical AND research experience and for those of us that are unsure which, if any, psychology path to follow this class is a must.  \nWorkload:\n3 essay tests.

If you are not passionate about what you learn in this class, don't bother taking it, because it is extremely unlikely that you will get a good grade, even if you study very hard.  The tests, made up of long essays, are graded in a highly arbitrary fashion in large part by the TAs, who happened to be horrendous this past semester.  You may have a perfect understanding of the coursework and still get Cs on the exams; the criteria of what constitutes a \"good essay\" seemed to change from test to test, and while the TAs paid lip service to the importance of understanding broad themes and concepts, they nitpicked and found fault in the slightest details.\n"

Now, the caveat: grading appears to arbitrary, though this may be largely the fault of the awful TAs we had (I will never take a course TA'd by one of them again). I have never understood material so well and studied so hard for such low grades. Conclusion: this is an excellent class, but DO NOT TAKE IT IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR GPA. I don't care how smart you are or how good a student you are, you cannot be assured of a good grade. \nWorkload:\nReasonable, though exam prep can be time consuming.\n"
