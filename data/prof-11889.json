            "review_content": "\nI don't think Zachary Herz was a very successful professor. I didn't enjoy CC and it seems like the majority of my class agreed with me, since only 4 students didn't switch out of his section. He often let students take over discussions and was easily distracted, which invariably led to good portions of every class being dedicated to topics completely unrelated to the texts. He seemed proud of this, and thought that it made his class \"entertaining\", but I would have liked to have learned something from CC. Personally, I didn't find him a very pleasant person either, especially when he made fun of some students who left the class. I make fun of people too, but I'm not their professor. \nHe grades harder than your average professor, especially on your weekly responses. \nIf you're really interested in law, he's really knowledgeable about that and spends a lot of the class discussing legal issues in the texts, but if you're not I would recommend avoiding his class. \nWorkload:\nWeekly response, graded harshly\n3 essays, graded pretty harshly\nMidterm + final, graded pretty fairly\n"
