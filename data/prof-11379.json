            "review_content": "\nStandard uber-mediocre cellular neurobio course - Nothing exceptional at all about any of the lecturers (Zafir is, how should I put it, \"colorful\", Jessica is annoying and misleading about what will actually be on her test, and Firestein is funny and engaging, but has to cover way too much material in too little time, and is solid at doing so)  Jessica ran the course, and and in her midterm (the second one) she asked for very minute details as opposed to testing concepts - Memorize all your shit, and don't think hard, they will not test you deeply on concepts.\nTake the first two tests - The third is on a shitload of material.\nClass is curved to a B, so beware. If you're a neurscience major, you have no choice - Otherwise, steer clear.\nWorkload:\nMust read a scientific paper every week that are on exams, three midterms, two of which will count, and a final that was on three scientific papers.\n\n"
