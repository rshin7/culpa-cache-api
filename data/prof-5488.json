            "review_content": "\nShe was nice and fairly clear in her lectures, though she put no effort into preparing lectures and largely did problems from the book, which was unhelpful since the book explained its problems well enough and you could ask a helproom helper about those problems.  She said that she didn't have time for many office hours and to come up with examples not from the book, but that doesn't help students taking the class.  She assigned almost no homework, which was good because it wasn't a burden but it was also a little difficult because the slightest mistake weighed heavily and you got little idea how well you knew the material.  Her tests were very hard, and she tried to cover too much material (complex numbers, on top of the standard calc IV material), but she scaled the grades, so that seemed pretty fair to me.  She was an okay teacher.\nWorkload:\nSummer session, one homework per week, about six questions, one midterm, final.\n"
