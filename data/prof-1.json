            "review_content": "\nOverall, this class was an enjoyable, though perhaps slightly challenging, experience online. What the reviewer below me says about the jokes, metaphors, eccentricity, and engagement is true. \nUnfortunately, what they say about the pacing of the class is true too, but I don't think it's as big of a problem as made out to be: while the number of \"chapters\" (really just pdfs of some notes - there's not an actual textbook) is heavily concentrated in the latter half of the course, the presentation of the material doesn't feel substantially faster or more difficult. While some important topics in business cycle theory are glossed over a bit more, Xavier has the skill of clearly explaining the complex nuances. He's simply more passionate about the growth topics, and I don't see a huge problem with that. Also, lectures always begin with about 10-20 min of a recap from the previous class which helps you get in the mindset of the new content that's about to come.\nThe TAs: did their jobs well but perhaps not outstanding. Personally, I didn't know that they did office hours until the weekend before the final but that's probably on me. I also don't think their response to student complaints were unreasonable: from my understanding, the complaints were variants of \"but this is hard.\"\nOne complaint that the professor didn't handle well was relating to the synchronous nature of the midterm and final. Many international students would've had to take the final at odd hours of the day, but the professor didn't seem to have much sympathy, citing that the only way to make the final asynchronous would require making the final open note which would require increasing the difficulty of the math. I find that reasoning to be erroneous. \nAnd of course, as others have noted, I should emphasize Xavier's jokes and metaphors: I think they help facilitate learning, and I think they helped make this course entertaining for me even if I didn't find the content as interesting. \nWorkload:\nAverage 2.7 hours of out-of-class work a week.\n4 problem sets (should've been 8 but we fell behind): 3-10 hours each.\nMidterm and Final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nHaving completed the Holy Trinity of the introductory sequence(Gulati, Elmes, and Xavier), I must say Xavier's class is the most disappointing of the talk-ed up intro econ professors. Xavier himself has a truly unique background and eccentric personality, clearly passionate about growth economics, soccer, and Catalonia. The class, however, is a garbage fire. \nThe first half of the semester consists of Xavier's bread and butter speeches about theories of economic growth, his personal anecdotes with leading economists and world leaders, and various quirky metaphors that make otherwise dry material very engaging.\nThe second half of the semester is where the pile-up begins. Increasingly larger, but not necessarily more complex concepts are thrown at you without rest. Whereas the first semseter and midterm cover literally a chapter of Xavier's textbook, the second semester covers 6-7. Pacing as a concept does not seem to exist in this class. While I enjoy thinking about growth economics, I do not even think the first semester is even the most important from intermediate macro! Key differences between the Keynesian and Classical schools, monetary and fiscal policy, all are blazed through unmercilessly.\nNo help is to found from the TAs in this course. Reading other reviews, it seems like TAs are lost every semester, but this cohort was especially disorganized. Conveniently cancelling their office hours before major deadlines, complaining about the unreasonableness of student questions when the majority of us just wanted a clear timeline as to when things might be due, and showing a general lack of initiative in attempting to address student concerns are only a few examples. This is not to say that the TAs did not go above and beyond in other ways: creating video series and holding extra sessions to explain concepts illustrated their personal interest in seeing students suceed. Going above and beyond expectations however, is better appreciated when the bare minimums are being met, namely a clear communication of deadlines and expectations regarding course material.\nAs for the course material itself, it isn't too difficult. The math prerequisite is more than sufficient for the material in the course, and is used sparingly. The homework and exam questions themeselves can get frustrating at times, as though they may appear opinion based, they are really looking for the direct text found in Xavier's textbook. I did not find the midterm particularly hard, and though I have not taken it yet, the final appears to be a considerably larger amount of work. Although one may find it easier than other sections to obtain an A in this course, this comes at the expense of learning fully several of the more foundational topics of Macroeconomics. For this reason, I really can't recommend taking this course with Xavier if you are intending to major in econ. While his energy is infectious, this course was a bust in my opinion. \n \nWorkload:\nVery light, ~5 hours a week with no p-set and ~10 with. Your mileage may vary, but if you've read the readings for the material being covered, the homework is just regurgitation.\n"

Some materials include topics from micro (utility function, etc.). Also, he spends too much time on unnecessary stories like how he met Sharon Stone at Davos. But the worst part is there is too much gap between what he teaches in class and pset/exam.\nIt makes things very difficult because he's super against using textbooks so that we don't really have a formalized materials to study, yet his lecture is just different from pset/exam.\nI understand most of the econ-core lectures at Columbia are terrible, but if I'm given a choice, I wouldn't take his class.\nWorkload:\nPset every 2-3 weeks. 1 midterm and a final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nXavier is generally a decent lecturer. But I have a bone to pick with him for a couple of reasons. Tho keep in mind that this is also just my biased opinion. \nFor the first two weeks, instead of actually teaching us economics, he gave us propaganda lectures on how the world has seen tremendous economic growth over the last few centuries(the message being that we gotta stop to smell the roses), and how inequality is really not such a serious issue because a) cross-country inequality is decreasing, and b) a rising tide lifts all boats!! It felt like a very self-serving message. Like hey guys, check out the splendid achievements of economics (btw I am famous growth economist), the people who grumble about poverty and inequality are totally just missing the bigger picture.   \nThen for the first half of the semester, he focuses on the solow-swan model of growth. The model in essence is pretty simple. In a nutshell, the key result is that because there are diminishing returns to capital, economies cannot achieve permanent growth through investing in capital alone (only technological progress can facilitate permanent growth). Okay, not so mind blowing. This also is a highly oversimplified model of the economy of course. \nBut Xavier made a really big deal out of it. He claimed that throughout the latter half of the 20th century, African countries and international aid agencies just kept building more machines because they thought increasing capital was the key to economic growth. But the Solow-Swan model states that you cannot achieve permanent economic growth this way!!! So in conclusion...that's why Africa continues to lag behind in economic development today. Case cracked! Like bro c'mon, that's a seriously oversimplified, distorted picture of reality.\nWorkload:\nnot too bad\n"

However, he rushed through the remaining 8 chapters in the second half of the semester and I still feel like I barely understand the part about tax and budget constraint. \nAlso this class is very disorganized.

With that being said, this isn't a great class. Lectures move incredibly slowly the first half of the semester, and then frantically speed up the second half. The lecture notes are messy and the tangential TA notes contain errors or additional information that is contradictory or presented differently. All in all, as someone who could not get themselves to pay attention in class, studying for the midterm and final was an absolute mess. The notes were just so disorganized and confusing. There were so many gaps in information. The good news, though, was that with a lot (a loooooot) of studying, the exams were pretty manageable. There's kind of a pattern to his testing. I really recommend understanding the lecture notes and basically memorizing the pset formats. That's how you succeed in this class. Overall, I learned little to nothing--I wish Xavier covered topics more widely taught in macro. Simply put, this class was messy and Xavier seemed a little too preoccupied to provide us with a comprehensive and eye-opening class. \nWorkload:\nNot bad -- PSET about every two weeks. \nGot really stress-y before midterm and final, though.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis was by far my favorite class at Columbia. It was an 8:40 which was unfortunate, but Xavier's lectures were so riveting that I wouldn't actually mind going to class. And I knew I wasn't alone in this, as the lecture room was nearly full every morning. Essentially this course explores the question \"why are some countries poor?\" The class is a mix of theory, models and mathematics, and Xavier blends the three elements together as if telling a semester long economic narrative, rather than lecturing at you. The math involved isn't particularly terrifying for an upper level economics class- the most complicated it gets is Lagrangian, but it's basically applied in a manner that is no more difficult than it was in micro. I think the most compelling thing about this class was the way in which math was used to help tell the story of economic development. You don't feel like you are learning abstract and pointless graphs and equations, but rather real-life solutions. \nAlso, Xavier is basically the best human being. A funny, passionate, quirky Spanish guy, he explains complex concepts in a simplified yet elegant way. He matches his brightly colored suit jacket to his power point every day, calls Trump our \"funny orange man\" and uses the game of soccer to explain the concept of idea innovation. It really doesn't get better. And he is very approachable and loves questions. I seriously encourage all undergraduates to take this class. It makes economics relevant, inspiring and challenges you without being overwhelming you.\nNow, I am a bit biased because development economics is my area of interest. But I will say that a large reason as to why I have taken an interest to that field is because of the some of the things I was exposed to in this class. So take that for what it's worth.\nWorkload:\na long list of \"readings\" which are all optional- it's a \"read if you are interested in this topic!\" deal, not a \"read because you have to\"\n20% problem sets, only 3 for the whole semester, graded very fairly\n30% research paper, topic of your choice\n50% final (no midterm, which is a huge bonus)\n\n"

The midterm is fairly simple as long as you do the practice tests, the final is quite a bit harder overall, but not too hard. The best tactic for this class is to complete the practice tests before the midterm/final a few times so you can memorize the concepts, and to attend class the second half of the semester. The first half Xavier goes very slowly, and it is not a challenge at all, the second half compensates by going very quickly, so go to class and try to grasp the concepts for the second half/ in preparation for the final.

Whereas my Micro professor was all about mathematics and proofs and trick questions, Xavier was all about FUN and learning. He explained concepts so well that I could always recall what exactly he said about specific concepts. He uses metaphors (\"cookies\" as real GDP), animated examples, and his quirky humor. At times, I felt this guy could even teach kindergarteners macroeconomics. The problem sets were usually well written as well. You get a few easy questions and the rest require slight tweaks to the models. The lecture was extremely entertaining as you saw from his famous words about children. But the one I loved the most was the Columbia students as a wicked example of the \"borrower\" lol. Also, as a non-conventional Growth Economics, Xavier taught us both the classical and Keynesian views. What a good deal for me. At the end of the day, I have learned so much with MINIMUMAL STRESS thanks to a great teacher like this.\nAlthough the class size was overwhelmingly large and occasionally someone would ask questions that I would rather ask in the recitations, I appreciated this equal opportunity for 400 people to enjoy such a good class. The Econ department should also do the same thing with CORPORATE FINANCE: provide more opportunities for non-Financial-Econ majors to explore this area and recognize that registration priority is BS, bureaucratic, and anti-intellectual.\nMy ONLY complaint to the class was the fact that the TAs, who made the final, failed to proofread questions and left us with SIX mistakes. COME ON guys. We had 10 TAs and none of them paid enough attention to proofreading. \nGrade received: A (missed a few lectures due to recruiting and never attended recitation due to my campus jobs but thanks to the good notes that Xavier posted, I was able to pull it through)\nWorkload:\n8 Problem Sets. 1 Midterm. 1 Final.

            "review_content": "\nAs everyone else has mentioned, there are a lot of great reasons to take Xavier's class. He's funny. He's an expert in long-run growth and has a pretty interesting perspective on current international development, which he discusses at length. He picks a few key points and drives them home, making it obvious what you are expected to learn and therefore obvious what you'll be tested on. And Carlos the TA is awesome, and he will spoil you like no other.\nThat said, I'd like to contest a few common claims about this class:\n1) Carlos's recitation notes aren't the best way to learn the material; the new textbook chapters are. They cover all of the material in the class extremely thoroughly -- half the time, the answers to the problem sets were literally written out in the textbook. And Carlos writes them with Xavier, so it's still the same perspective that you get at his recitation.\n2. The other TAs are actually more than just graders. After literally standing through Carlos's recitation the second week, I decided to try another section. And the TA teaching the recitation was smart. And she knew the material really well. And she could answer questions and explain interesting digressions because there were three other people in the room. It was great. \n3. This is not the best class to take as a way to fulfill the requirements of the econ major. You will come out of it with a very thorough understanding of some aspects of macroeconomics, and granted, things like long-run growth or the impact of changes in productivity are hugely important. But you will not come out of this class with a good understanding of the field of macroeconomics. You will not be able to understand an intelligent conversation about the economy because you won't have even heard of half the concepts that anyone walking out of the Principles of Econ final could explain. You will fully understand every variation of every concept that was taught, but you will not have a basic literacy in macroeconomics.\nSo take this class if you're looking to learn how Xavier sees the world. It's pretty darn interesting. But don't take it if you're looking to cover all the basics of macroeconomics. \n\nWorkload:\n8 problem sets, easy midterm, manageable final\n"

            "review_content": "\nDespite what some previous reviews might suggest, there is really nothing out of the ordinary about this class.  The professor is renowned in long-run growth economics, and is well known for his attire, style, and attitude.  On the plus side, he's definitely a good lecturer and will generally keep you entertained, the course certainly was not too difficult, and great help was available throughout the course of the semester.  The class as a whole wasn't anything to write home about, but it wasn't terrible either, and in the end, it didn't seem like most people in the class felt very strong about it one way or another.  \nThe biggest problem with the class was the way that it was paced, and I don't think this was anything new this year.  We spent until the midterm, which was in Mid-October, on long-run economic growth. Given that the instructor is a specialist in this field, he certainly has a lot to bring to the table, particularly during this portion of the course.  This material certainly was very interesting, but material was very sparse in these lectures.  During this time we covered the Solow Model, the AK model, the Solow Residual, and poverty traps,and that was basically what was covered on the midterm.  This was certainly valuable material, nobody needed a month and a half to learn it; it could've been covered in a couple of weeks.  The reason it took so long was in part due to his tendency to spend 20 minutes at the beginning of each lecture reviewing the previous lecture.  Sometimes this was appreciated; other times he went too far and basically repeated entire lectures, wasting valuable time.  Also, he spent several lectures on topics that, albeit interesting, were completely lacking in substance; these topics might be worth 5 minute digressions, but certainly not entire lectures.  For example, we spent an entire week on the evolution of ideas.\n\nTowards the end of the course, the pace of the course picked up dramatically so that we could finish covering all the intended topics.  The post-midterm topics included Robinson-Crusoe: Consumption and Leisure Theory, theory of money demand, theory of investment, Classical vs. Keynesian macroeconomics, and government spending.  The first few topics were covered pretty slowly, but in the end it was pretty rushed.  Government spending was covered entirely during the last lecture, and this material ended up accounting for 20% of the final exam.  \nI found that Carlos's recitation notes were really the best way for me to learn the material; this was true both when I went to class and when I did not.  I unfortunately had a conflict with Carlos's recitation time, but based on my experience with his notes and review sessions, he really is as great as everyone says.  In addition to putting a ton of effort into the class, he really has a mastery of both understanding and communicating the material that is rare among TAs.  I'm sure his recitations were immensely helpful; he's really personable and entertaining, but he is also very efficient with time.  \nProblem set distribution was also uneven throughout the course of the semester.  We didn't have a first problem set until three weeks went by, and then they were either weekly or biweekly, until the last three weeks when they were weekly.  This was representative of the uneven pacing of the course, as in there were weeks that so little was covered that it didn't make sense to assign a problem set.  In the end there were a total of eight.  The problem sets were definitely doable and representative of the material that we were responsible for in the class, but at times they were unnecessarily repetitive and emphasized regurgitation of the material over thorough understanding of the concepts.  The grading on the problem sets was very harsh, but in the end, the exams are what will decide your grade.  Regardless of how many problems were assigned, only one of them was graded, and answers that didn't match the solutions were penalized heavily.  \nThe midterm exam was very predictable after doing the problem sets and the previous year's exam.  It was basically guaranteed that there would be one problem about the Solow Model and one problem about the Solow Residual.  The grading was harsh, and like the problem sets, you will lose points if your explanations do not match those in the solutions.  The final exam was twice the length and cumulative, and a bit more difficult.  It was still very doable despite demanding a lot of writing.  A lot of material was covered in the second half of the course, and all of it shows up on the exam.  I was surprised that government spending counted for 20% of the points on the exam despite only being taught on the last day of class, and no problem set was assigned for this topic. \nUltimately, this class definitely isn't the worst way to take the course if it's a requirement for your major, but it's nothing to rave about either.  Certainly not worth avoiding, but it's also not worth switching up your schedule to end up in the class.  If this class is more than a requirement to you, and you truly want to learn the material, I'd recommend taking a look at the other section of the class as well.  This class was definitely very light mathematically (a few derivatives on the homework and in lecture, but nothing more), and it took an interesting look at a few select topics.  If there is an option between a mathematical derivation and a graphical explanation, the graphical explanation will almost always be used in this class.  If you're looking for a mathematically rigorous survey of the most important topics in macroeconomics, you should look elsewhere.\n\nWorkload:\nThe grade was calculated as follows:\n20% Problem Sets, of which there were 8, and the lowest grade was dropped.  These were biweekly at the beginning of the semester and weekly by the end.\n30% Midterm, average 82 and standard deviation 19\n50% Final, and this became 80% if the grade was better than the midterm\n"

            "review_content": "\nYou probably know most of the most noteworthy things about Xavier, so here are some major sticking points:\n1) Yes, it's a funny class. Audit the first one or two just for fun. After the first few, the jokes get fewer and farther between, but there's almost always something good (his explanation of taxes at the end of the semester was priceless). \n2) The material that Xavier teaches, he teaches well. You won't leave the class scratching your head because there's something you didn't understand. His explanation of the difference between Keynesians and Classical economists is excellent. \n3) That said, the pace is extremely slow, as mentioned before. There was a 2-hour review session before the final, and it really did feel like it covered the whole course pretty hermetically, which shows you how little material there actually was. So I'd wager pretty much any other class in macroeconomics will teach you more. \n4) The worst part of the course: assignments and tests. Do not be surprised if your final grade does not reflect your actual capabilities (I'm saying this as someone who has not yet seen his final grade, so this isn't a personal vendetta), because there are many arbitrary issues with the grading. Problem sets are not hard (though you may need help from wikipedia and google sometimes), but only one question (out of 5-6) is graded each time, so if there's one small mistake or way in which you answered differently than what the solution is supposed to look like, it could take 10, 20 or 30 points off. One example: a problem set in which the question asked something like \"What the effects of X are\". We got an email after the PS was handed in, mentioning that of course this necessitated graphs to show the answer, though this was not mentioned in the question. I had 30 points taken off for that reason. \nOr take the final test. It wasn't too difficult, and was relatively straightforward. However, there was a rule (unfathomable to me) that you only have one A4 page for each question. On the last question, which had around 8 parts, the last 2 necessitated around 2 graphs each, after some 6 graphs earlier in the question. I had run out of space, but was allowed neither to get a new page nor extra time to re-copy my answers. So I ended up not being able to answer the questions, despite knowing the material perfectly well. \nI never went to Carlos' recitation (technical issues), but it's not hard to understand the material from lectures and even more from the book chapters posted to courseworks (most of the problem sets can be answered just by looking at those) \nSo if you want a fun class, interesting explanations and overall not a difficult experience- take this class. If you want to learn a lot and are shooting for a sure A, consider other sections. \nWorkload:\nAround 8 problem sets, rather easy, take a few hours each to thoroughly finish them- which you'll want to do, because the grading is tough (see above). \nMidterm: not difficult, and can only help you (if it would lower your grade, it isn't counted). Grading is strict, though (was deducted 8 points for two miniscule errors)\nFinal: Tougher than the midterm but manageable. Go over all the problem sets and book chapters and you should be fine. (Apart from arbitrary stuff, see above)\n"

I learned more about macroeconomics from my principles class than I did from Xavier's class. To give you a little over-view, we spent over two months discussing and REVIEWING the solow-swan model ad nauseam, something that we could have easily spent two weeks, if that, learning. Xavier dedicated a weeks worth of lectures to \"ideas\"--now I know Zara makes clothing faster than H&M;, thanks Xavier--and even spent a lecture talking about the history of money... did you know ancient civilizations used animal bones and feathers as mediums of exchange? Yup, that happened. Also, as technically the last macroeconomic requirement for econ majors we talked about government spending for 30 minutes in the final lecture of the course. Not only can Xavier NOT teach, but he is also NOT funny. Every time he simplified an equation or gathered terms he, in attempt to get some laughs, called it an \"old Japanese tradition\"...the only \"old Japanese tradition\" I wanted to commit in that class was Seppuku. \nThe only redeeming feature of this course was Carlos, our head TA. He was FANTASTIC, and everything I got out of this macro class was due to him. He put together excellent lecture and review notes with extra problems that challenged us and were great review for the midterm/ final.\nBUT, that being said, if you have the choice between this and ANY OTHER macro class, I would go for the other, it was PAINFUL sitting through Xavier's lectures, and can confidently say I learned next to nothing about macroeconomics. \nWorkload:\n8 Problem Sets, Midterm/Final.\n"

He wears funky blazers to class and has a sense of humor that will crack up the entire hall and lighten the mood, especially during a confusing lecture (like when he is deriving the Solow-Swan model, or explaining the income and substitution effects). On top of that, he's a great economist. A lot of the reviews say that yes, he's funny and all, but he doesn't know how to lecture. I did not find this true at all. Xavier is very passionate and knowledgable about the material, and goes through everything in an orderly and gradual manner. Even if that leaves you a bit confused, he will go over the main points of the concept during the next lecture to make sure you're up to speed. He has a great way of relating everything to real world issues, and will constantly give you present-day examples or anecdotes that keep the class interesting and relevant.\nThat being said, the class is 300+ students and Xavier is a busy guy. The TAs are very helpful and extremely approachable, especially Carlos. GO TO HIS RECITATION. This guy is indispensable. He wrote notes for every topic we took (which practically became the textbook for the class, as Xavier doesn't assign one), and held weekly recitations that went over Xavier's material and helped solve the problem sets. Trust me, you will be completely lost in the class without Carlos. He is very nice, holds extra office hours, and always responds promptly to e-mails. He also held 3 hour review sessions for the midterm and the final, which were extremely helpful. Most of the questions on the exams were similar to those he did in the sessions. Seriously... make use of this guy. You will not survive the class without him. \nAll in all, I loved this class. It was challenging and the problem sets were sometimes annoying, but there were always TA sessions and office hours that helped. I came out of this class having learned so much and not regretting any of the effort I put in. If you love macro and want to have a fun, interesting, and engaging semester, take Xavier's class.\nWorkload:\n8-9 problem sets, assigned almost every week-- usually a week before they are due. The TAs will hold recitations going over the problem sets before they are due, as they can sometimes appear endless and irrelevant to Xavier's lecture.\nEasy midterm.

And here's why.\nThe design of the macroeconomics course is insane. There's no textbook-- meaning it's, like, impossible to have certain things directly defined in a completely go-to source. Also, Xavier sometimes repeated entire lectures. Don't get me wrong; he is a decent lecturer. But there was little sense of direction. Problem sets were indiscriminately distributed; we were given one on a Sunday night during midterms due that Wednesday. Were we ever given our problem sets back? I'm still not sure. The midterm and final were very harshly graded and needlessly nit-picked (though generously curved). This course was designed such that concern for student learning was completely absent. Oh yeah, and you're sitting in a class of 300+, so you really won't get any attention from Xavier, unless it's to ask some douchey question to pet your own ego, as many in the course were wont to do.\nThe TA that everyone came to know and love, Carlos Montez-Galdon, was absolutely indispensable. Honestly, it's unbelievable how much he cared about us learning. He singlehandedly crafted a textbook from the lectures and provide his own lectures with notes. And he was highly approachable. And helpful. Without him, I wouldn't have learned macroeconomics. And he routinely sent us e-mails apologizing for Xavier's faux pas, empathizing with us when we were expected to jump through ridiculous hoops. Why can't he create a macroeconomics course and teach us? He certainly cared more about us learning than Xavier did. \nIn short, If you have a genuine intellectual interest in economics REALLY want to learn macroeconomics-- not just scrape by, but REALLY understand it and, above all, be taught in a course designed to teach you, I don't recommend this class. If you want to be a Wall Street suit and are content scraping by with Bs and As with relatively little actual understanding of how things work, this class is decent. It's certainly not unreasonably difficult. It just wasn't created with your learning as the top priority.\n\nWorkload:\n10 problem sets; midterm; final.\n"

He's rather shy when you approach him personally, but he always stays for 10, 15 minutes to answer questions. A few interesting things to note are that he often delivers very important commentaries where he explains that he believes macro is more important than micro, and that growth theory, is exceedingly more important short run business cycle disputes. We also can tell he's more of a free-marketeer libertarian, especially when he comes to making jokes of politicians, bureaucrats and governments. Xavier's class is structured into two sections: growth and business cycle theory. He's usually traveling the world, so he's not really at office hours, but he actually responds to e-mails rather promptly.\nXavier is an entertaining lecturer to listen, but he makes it difficult to follow and take notes, although he also spends 20 minutes reviewing the key points from the previous lecture. You learn a lot more from the TA's office hours and recitation, and they are usually rather good. Try to take Sean David Spielberg's TA session. After attending all the TA sessions, I confess he's the best. Detailed notes are posted on Courseworks and solution sets as well.\nThe problem sets are challenging but easy if you work in groups of two or three. If you can do them on your own, then you'll have no problem on the exam. (Its also no lie that the answers to the problems circulate everywhere) \nThe midterm and finals are extremely challenging, and the final is even more ridiculous. It usually involves a lot of intuitive reasoning and requires you to be agile and think on your feet. Many have said that the final is so explicitly difficult to weed out the true economists from the econ majors and the non-econ anybodies. Everyone walked out scared, thinking they failed so the curve is generous. I was personally a defined economics major prior to taking this class. Walking out of the final, I'm not longer certain. If you can rock this class, you're an economics major for sure. \nWorkload:\nAbout 9 or 10 problem sets, each with about four questions. Each has a couple of sub-questions. (The answers are easy to acquire...)\nMidterm is not that bad, usually four questions, and easy if you've studied intensely. (KNOW THE SOLOW SWAN Equation and the Solow Residual)\nFinal is a thousand times tougher than midterm as it is twice as long and cumulative. \n"

Yes, Xavier is one of the most charismatic, politically incorrect, dazzling, and best dressed men on campus.  He is also a superb lecturer who understands what he is teaching and hopes to pass that clarity on to his students.\nHOWEVER, this class is literally a circus in terms of how it is run.  For starters, there is no connect between Xavier and his TA's.  Homeworks are not returned in a timely manner, the TAs do not know what is going on with the exams [perfect example: last year's head TA told her recitation that a certain concept would not be on the exam because it seemed too easy, and ended up smack in the middle of the final], and forget solving grading disputes.  No one will be there to listen.\n There is also no textbook suitable for this course as it is designed at the whim of the lecturer.  You are really left to survive a sea of mismatched topics and Xavier's vocabulary in which \"cookies\" stand for GDP and tequila shots explain 3D utilities.\nThe man himself is incredible, the course is severely lacking in transparency.  \nWorkload:\nProblem Sets [decent], 1 midterm, 1 final.  Both exams are filled with challenging questions- however the final urges you to explore more complex concepts.  You are given barely the tools you need to figure them out in class.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI have to disagree with all the positive reviews of this professor; Xavier is a nice guy who may keep you entertained for fourteen weeks, but he will not do a good job teaching you macrecon.  \nFirst, I have a few quibbles with the way the course was organized.  Growth theory was definitely overemphasized at the expense of Business cycle theory, but I suppose that was Xavier's prerogative.  As others have said, the problem sets prepare you well for his exams since most exam questions are just like HW questions, so do the hw multiple times if you want to do well.  That said they didn't help me much in understanding how the models worked or how to apply them.  I don't know exactly what it is students typically learn in a class like this, but from glancing at other course sites Xavier's approach is pretty idiosyncratic.\nThat brings me to the real problem with this course.  Xavier's idiosyncratic models and techniques wouldn't have been so bad if he had spent more time actually teaching them instead of, say, talking about some NGO in Africa for 45 mins.  I've got nothing against the flamboyant costumes or canned humor but this man has a pathological self-indulgent streak.  As for his his infamous classroom persona, I thought it was boring and predictable but probably would have got a kick out of it if I had been a few years younger.  Take that for whatever it's worth.  Mainly I think he spent too much time trying to get his students to like him instead of just teaching the material and doing his job.  When he does get to talking about economics it's usually vague, semi-intuitive statements with a rushed derivation and some Q&A; thrown in.  \nXavier is smart guy, reputed to be a first class researcher, and obviously cares about his students but he just doesn't make it come together.  I would sit in class wondering when he was going to write definitions on the board and derive equations, and then go home and try to teach myself the material.  I can honestly say that almost everything I learned in this class came from recitation, supplementary notes from the TAs, and Barro's textbook (it's not quantitative and doesn't follow Xavier's approach but it's still good). \nIn the end, you could do worse than Xavier, but if you're majoring in econ or are seriously interested in the material you would stand to benefit from shopping other sections or even waiting until the next semester.  \n"

While Xavier offers excellent explanations in class of the theories we cover, he moves incredibly fast and I found that my notes could not often keep up with his logic.  This is espeically important because there is no textbook for the class, though I agree that the Problem Set solutions are practically a textbook.  The TA's are helpful enough, but in a lecture of 400 people it is difficult to nail all of the concepts before the final.  \nI also think that the material covered in the class is specifically catered to Xavier and his interests.  While this is amazing because we study theories that he himself developed, it may also make further study of economics difficult.  You cannot refer to books and materials outside of the classroom because they simply don't follow the Xavier logic of things (which is incredible and fun, but not always obvious).\nIf you are not overloaded for the semester and are able to put in a lot of time to understand the course material, then I would say take it.  If not, you might be better off taking a more streamline Macro class and perhaps Xavier's elective later.\n\nWorkload:\nWeekly Problem Sets (not difficult but incredibly time consuming), a midterm (direct copy of the problem sets), and an absolutely killer final.

The material is graduate level and he never taught it in class! But yet people got 100% Either they cheated, were brilliant economists, or an idiot savant that sits in the front seat.

His board-work is a little messy, though not completely terrible.\nHe is extremely engaging and entertaining, so whether you understand what\u00c2\u2019s going on or not, you\u00c2\u2019ll likely be tuned into the lecture. Be ready to take some of his less than politically correct comments in jest. (However, as politically incorrect as they may be, you\u00c2\u2019ll laugh at how on-the-mark they really are!) Out of class, and in his hours, Sala was very approachable, and helpful.\nHe is both theoretical and pragmatic, making the course a good learning experience overall \u00c2\u2013 in the end you end up getting the big picture better than in most classes. The class is taught at a Master\u00c2\u2019s level; it\u00c2\u2019s not as easy as intermediate macro, but not as hard as a PhD Econ class. It follows that a lot of SIPA grad students take the class, some advanced undergrads, and one or two (lazy) PhD students at most.\nYou\u00c2\u2019ll be expected to be on point with your multi-variable calculus, though not much beyond that. You\u00c2\u2019ll need to use basic Lagrangian optimization techniques quite often. No econometrics is used. The class deals with mostly super-long run classical economic theory, so focus on that if you want to brush up on the intuition. He developed endogenous growth-theory based on R&D;/innovation at the end of the class, a concept that he built from the ground up, starting with the Solow-Swan growth models and even their immediate precursors. You\u00c2\u2019ll be exposed to some of progression of the models and ideas that have led to more recent endogenous-growth ideas.\nThe final is difficult, mostly because you don\u00c2\u2019t have a clue what will be on it (and he covers a fair amount of ground). Like another reviewer correctly mentioned, he\u00c2\u2019ll throw some curve balls at you while he\u00c2\u2019s at it. He didn\u00c2\u2019t test very excessively on the mathematics (since most SIPA students are weak in this field), but he did push some theoretical ideas he didn\u00c2\u2019t very much develop in class. A recommendation: if you want an easy A, don\u00c2\u2019t take this class, since it\u00c2\u2019s all-or-nothing on the not-so-easy 100% weighted and cumulative final. \nIn terms of workload, HW is optional and upgraded, but you\u00c2\u2019ll be screwed come the final if you don\u00c2\u2019t do it. \nI can conclude by saying that the class was an excellent experience, and I recommend it to anyone that has a true desire to learn from one of the top growth economists on the face of the planet. \n"

The homeworks were optional.\nThe final counted for 100%, and spanned everything and anything seen in class.\nSome of the questions (an important percentage) on the exam went a step beyond the homeworks, and required an ability to apply your knowledge rather than allowing you to mechanically repeat what the notes or homeworks exposed one to. He tested stuff he never explicity taught or assigned.\nThe man tests a bit like a European instructor teaching in Europe. He expects graduate level effort from a G4000-level class, and the homeworks were pretty much of his Grad Macro course, with some slight difficulty downgrading. And he doesn't care too much if your GPA is destroyed. My advice: study very hard, and know your material inside and out, or take one of his mid-level courses for an easier ride. \n"

Despite my deep interest in economics, I found this course very difficult to follow.  The course was taught in an unconventional way and order, which limited student comprehension of the material. As a TA mention, without having the skill taught in later classes, we were trying to asses difficult concepts which are normally not introduced in an economics class. Confusion was futhered by the fact that there was no book to accompany the lectures. Rather the students wereleft to try to make an order of what was learned with documents formulated by the TAs. This class has enormous potential. But it seiously needs either one of two things.  Either Xavier writes a text to accompany the class, or he begins to teach it in a way that is more in line with another book he suggests.  That there are no books to accompany the class, simply indicates the bizarre nature and order of the class.  Few days from the final, I can say that the class was an amazing experience, yet I worry as to whether this sort of unconventional grounding in macro will now be enough to further my study in economics. \nWorkload:\nproblem sets nearly each week, that varied greatly in length and difficulty.

THE MAN IS INCREDIBLE!!!\nAllow me to begin by saying that the majority of people who review professors on CULPA  usually either had a fabulous experience with a professor or a horrible one.  I had a great experience!\nThat being said, Professor Sala-I-Martin's class was extraordinary.  The man is a genius in the world of Macroeconomics, in particular in the areas of Economic Growth theory.  Please do not be alarmed by those who say he is \"condescending;\" although he calls us kids, he never does so in a negative or condescending way. He is of Spanish descent where teachers and professors are culturally considered to be your parents away from home and thus his calling us kids is a mere expression of care and not one of  arrogance.\nConcerning his teaching abilities: the man is an extremely avid and talented communicator.  There was never a time when I did not understand what he was talking about.  Moreover, he catered to questions throughout every lecture, so there is really no reason to not understand any aspect of the subject material.  I also appreciate his vivaciousness and flambuoyancy; economics can be exciting, especially for those of us who are Econ majors, but he makes it even more exciting through his jokes and comical personality.\nRegarding the subject material itself: I found it to be more than appropriate.  There were some students who did not appreciate the Econ Growth part, especially since a significant portion of the class was dedicated to this area, but I found it rewarding that we could learn these revolutionizing theories in economics from a leader in the field.   Econ Growth is primarily focused on eliminating poverty, particularly in Africa; it amuses me to think that so many so-called Columbia \"Socialists\" and \"Left-wingers\" would much rather have spent an entire semester focusing on Business Cycle Theory, i.e. the economics of rich nations. \nWorkload:\nWeekly problem set that is not graded, but must be turned in.  We had 1 mid-term, although I believe there are typically two in this class.  Sala-I-Martin kept his promise that they would be taken word-for-word from the problem sets, so essentially, if you understood all of the problem sets (not memorized them since the numbers were changed), you probably scored >96 on the mid-term.  The final: he said it was not going to be done in the same spirit of the problem sets, but it was.  Same kind of questions, different scenarios.  Again, if you understood all of the problem sets (about 10), you aced the final.  This worked for me and many of my collegues, ALL OF WHICH EARNED A 's and A+'s. \n"

The good: Despite claims of a classical bias, Xavier's conservative stance is quite rare among prominent economists and he effectively balances classical and Keynesian theory. For a class of 350+ students, Xavier effectively engages students with questions and the M&M; peanut board/ceremony are creative ideas. The bad: It's odd to see a teacher respond seriously to student questions/comments and yet still treat the class like children, just moved up from \"kindergarten\". Occasionally amusing anecdotes, but there was this long stretch of lectures where Xavier could not avoid take that single moment to interrupt himself to say f-ck this or f-ck that, which had very little to do with macro and wasn't even funny (no comment on the people who actually found that stuff amusing). To be blunt, the disney themes (of the problem sets) are stupid, but that reflects the weirdness of his webpage, which also contains an attack against an unnamed economist (turn off meta-refresh in your browser, load www.columbia.edu/~xs23/) . Perhaps these are just results of Xavier's paying too much alcohol tax (Morris, Nat, this is NOT libel! Xavier even joked he pays no tobacco tax, but a lot of alcohol tax). The major reason Barro's Macroeconomics is on the syllabus is because Xavier's co-written a book with Barro and Barro was his PhD advisor at Harvard. Just go to class and use other macro texts as necessary. Verdict: Yes, it is overrated. Some of these overwhelmingly positive reviews seem to suggest that if you have strong enthusiasm for econ or are an econ major you'll suddenly want to specialize in macro because of Xavier's class, or major in econ if you weren't that interested in the first place. The course is too inconsistent. It is possible to be annoyed by Xavier's attempt to be too much of a showman (a condescending one at that) instead of a teacher.\nWorkload:\n10 problem sets (quite comprehensive of lecture material, thus straighforward if you pay attention), two regular exams (based directly on selected problem set questions, but not exactly verbatim as some have claimed; if you look at the distribution of scores, some students do unusually poorly, perhaps 'memorizing' or expecting the wrong questions to appear). final (not surprisingly, more difficult and meant to be more challenging in order to set the curve)\n"
