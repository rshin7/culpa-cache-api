However, all in all, he\u00c2\u2019s a nice guy that doesn\u00c2\u2019t take the course very seriously, and expects students to do the same. Class discussions focused on discussing relevant economic issues in the news and Fed policy.\n\nWorkload:\nNon-mandatory readings assigned for each class. Majority of grade determined by end-of-class presentation about a macroeconomics topic of your choice and a 8-12 (!) page paper to be submitted at the end of the finals period.\n"
