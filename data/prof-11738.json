            "review_content": "\nYohann is the smallest most adorable French professor you will ever meet. He made class more interesting that it should have been, given the texts, and always brought about interesting points and sections to reread and analyze. His type of personality is one I wish to see more often in professors here on campus. He was very approachable and willing to compromise if something was not working out.\nSome of the down sides: We moved extremely fast with the texts, often two or three book ahead of other classes. (one weekend, we had to read a book in its entirety). Also, if you don't like in-class debates where you go against another group of four while the rest of class stares at your waiting to rip you apart with questions you don't have the answer to, this section might not be for you. But overall, I would greatly recommend this professor.  \nWorkload:\nDaily reading, 2 take home essays(25%), in-class debate (20%), midterm (20%), and final(20%)\n"
