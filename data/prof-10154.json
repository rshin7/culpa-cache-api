He's been in historic preservation for decades and he has an endless trove of fascinating NYC architectural history knowledge. \nWhile the class is immensely enjoyable, don't be fooled into thinking it's easy. It's no tourist's walk through the city. There are plenty of reading, essays, and a substantial final project and paper. While he's not an easy grader, if you really, really want an A and work hard for it, you can get it.\nTake him seriously, take the class seriously, and you'll enjoy the heck out of it. Highly recommended.\nWorkload:\nI took the 6-week summer version so the reading, assignments, and final paper seemed like a lot of work, but it wasn't crushing.\n"
