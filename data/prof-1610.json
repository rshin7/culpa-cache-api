            "review_content": "\nTim was a great teacher, although too often hard on himself.  He taught the evening section which met just four times a week this year.  The class atmosphere was consistently relaxed, playful and a lot of fun.  Though this probably owed somewhat to the happy and congruous nature of our class itself, it certainly was aided by Tim and his great sense of humor, etc.  I recommend him to everyone who's looking to start down the russian road.  Oh, and also, two of Columbia's four winners in the national writing contest for first year russian students, were products of Tim's excellent teaching (including the one first prize winner).  That makes him, by some standards, the best russian teacher in the country...take note!\nWorkload:\nIt's standardized by the department; chapter test every two weeks or so...no midterm.  Oral and regular final.  Homework from the workbook everynight.\n"
