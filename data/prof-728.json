            "review_content": "\nRobert McCaughey seems like a very interesting professor, but unfortunately that does not come through in his class. For every major text that we speed through, you have to write an essay and a critique in which he obsesses over your essay title. I found all of our texts really interesting (a word that he insists you do not use) and the essays that were written was thought-provoking and a perfect set-up to an engaging class discussions. But to my disappointment, he would stifle discussion when we got to class. I am sure that he would be a great history professor, but in my experience as a seminar professor, he is very dry. My class was full of passionate, avid readers but every class was very quiet after the first few classes.\nWorkload:\nWriting an essay on every major text, which is about every other week, although they are only 10 points. Additionally critiquing someone in your class's essay, which is worth 5 points.\n"

The \"Captain,\" while a nice guy, is a dull lecturer and is unclear when communicating important vs. superfluous information. The exams are based on information that is not covered in class nor on the readings, and they take many days to prepare for. He grades fairly, but be warned that you will have panic attacks every time he hands out a study guide.\nWorkload:\nFair, but unorganized.\n2 mid-terms, 1 final, and 3 group presentations. \nRidiculous amounts of information covered on exams, but he grades them on a curve. \n"

We went through books like the Odyssey in three 1 hr 15 min classes. The material you cover is very superficial and I found myself not even caring about the quality of my essays since he grades all papers pretty much 87%-93%. \nWorkload:\nRead about 100-120 pages of a book for each class.

Professor McCaughey is jovial and can crack surprisingly good jokes.  His grading is generous; I doubt that anyone in my class is getting lower than a B this semester.  Most classes are spent by looking at the papers that people in the class wrote and then gradually leading into a class discussion about something.  There's a strong focus on the mechanics of writing.  Don't use the word \"however\" in your papers...ever.  Professor McCaughey lets his students get creative with writing; it's acceptable to write a paper in poem form as long as you don't do it all the time.  Overall, I would recommend this class. \nWorkload:\n6 papers (3-4 pages), 6 peer critiques (1 page), 1 self-critique (1 page).  NO FINAL!!! :)\n"

He posted all of his lecture notes online so if you missed class you could get them. The syllabus had no deadlines for the massive amount of reading; it just stipulated that a certain amount should be completed by each test. The tests were difficult with identifications, that the McCaughey himself said were intended to \"trick the student\", a section where a quote was given from a primary document and you were asked to identify who wrote, its title, and its date, as well as essays. The required discussion sections with TA's were somewhat trivial and didn't further my knowledge in the class. My TA made you post questions and responses each week we had section for the various supplemental novels we were required to read. If you want the workload of an upper level history course then take McCaughey. Overall his likeable and interesting personality doesn\u00c2\u2019t outweigh the demand of the class.\nWorkload:\nToo much for an introductory class. The class is split into three sections and the required books and documents for EACH section are as follows: one main text book used throughout the entire course, 2-3 biographies/historical books on the particular period, an average of 10 primary documents found online for each section (i.e. Declaration of Independence, The U.S. Constitution, excerpts from Uncle Tom\u00c2\u2019s Cabin, etc). You can get by without reading the entire main book, but reading the lecture notes, supplemental books, and primary documents are recommended. \n"

People rarely ask questions in his lectures, but when they do he's willing to answer and thoroughly knowledgeable. Discussion sections are run by TAs, but he leads one as well, so if you get a chance sign up for his because he leads fabulous sections as well. \nWorkload:\n2 Midterms, 1 paper (length depends on your TA), and a final (the final isn't cumulative). The reading is the expected workload for a history course, but you can avoid the \"supplementary readings\" (which are actually 6 novels) by skimming or using jstor.org\n"

His lectures sometimes wandered a bit, but not so much as to be an annoyance.  His tests do sometimes ask for minor details, but if you read the books and the online documents he posts the tests should be no problem.  I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in taking an introductory history course.\nWorkload:\nNot bad--a fair amount of reading, 2 midterms, a paper and a final.  One word of warning: this class also has a 1-hour bi-weekly discussion section in which you talk about one of the six books in the assigned reading.  This discussion section does not show up on any of the course descriptions so be prepared to reserve an hour outside of the normal lecture time if you want to take this class.\n"

His tests (2 tests and a cummulative final) consist of ID's, document IDs and a long essay.  He gives a choice for the essays but does not grade them the same.  IF you answer the \"easier\" of the two, he will assume you're taking the easy way out.  He is a picky grader and expects lots of time to be spent on preparing for his class.  He assigns two books per \"period\" (3 periods in a semester which line up with the 3 tests) but not all books are relevent.  Some will appear on the tests, others you will just read because he presents them as \"very important.\"  Loves to pick small, trifling events/people for test ID's.  \nWorkload:\n2 tests, 1 paper, final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. McCaughey has a very loose lecture style, which can be disconcerting for people who like a systematic approach to the material.  Class time in this seminar consists largely of presentations by individuals, watches (to get in the maritime spirit, the class is divided into three watches, groups that work together on projects for the duration of the semester), or guests.  Each watch makes three presentations and each person in the class makes an individual presentation.  Prof. McCaughey likes to make use of technology, so it's strongly recommended that the presentations be in website format.  This can be daunting, but it doesn't require anything you can't do with Microsoft FrontPage.  Typically, a watch or individual makes a presentation at the beginning of class, and we spend most of the rest of the class critiquing it.\nProf. McCaughey occassionally prepared talks on various aspects of maritime history and terminology.  The class wasn't very strong on the \"history\" part of its title.  A general grasp of American history helps but isn't a prerequisite.  \nParticipation is critical if you want a good grade in the class.  That means raising your hand frequently, and Prof. McCaughey will call on you if you don't.  Say something maybe once every ten minutes.  Take initiative in your watch as well, because the watch leaders (first mates) will report back to Prof. McCaughey on who is being helpful.  Go early in the individual presentations, and make all of your presentations strong.  Prof. McCaughey likes presentations to have \"an argument.\" They don't have to be absolutely groundbreaking, but give them a lot of depth and don't make a book report.  If you participate well, do well in your watch, and make good presentations, you'll get a good grade.  Make sure to do the quizzes that Prof. \nMcCaughey posts on CourseWorks right when he puts them up.  They don't affect your grade, but he doesn't like it when you don't do them.  Also, post your book/\nmovie reviews in a timely fashion, and put a modicum of thought into them.\nOne last point: the only grade you get in this class is the one that shows up on your transcript.  It can be worrisome when, as of the last day of class, you have no idea what your grade is going to be.  Prof. McCaughey is fairly generous though, so if you do what I've told you, you'll likely get an A.\nWorkload:\nFour presentations, very preferably in website format.  Three are done with your watch and one is by yourself.  Topics are things like the navy's next generation of ships or the history and development of container ships.  You must also post two written reviews of maritime books and/or movies.  There is occassional reading for class and just-for-fun quizzes on CourseWorks.  Not bad at all, especially for a four-\npoint seminar.\n"

While the info can at times be a little dry - which in my opinion it was with Columbia's early history, by the end of the semester, you don't want to put down McCaughey's book, Stand Columbia. This is a class for people just a little curious about the place they're going to be spending 4 years, people wanting to fulfil a history requirement as painlessly as possible, as well as hardcore history majors (and there were quite a few in the class). Just a warning, there wasn't quite enough about Barnard to satisfy me - although that is my opinion as a Barnard student who wanted to hear more about the school she goes to. But at the same time, Barnard did get more attention than other affilite institutions, so i suppose I'll just have to take what I can get.  :)\nWorkload:\nnot at all heavy. you don't have to do the readings if you go to class and take good notes. Yea, the short answer portion of the test require you to list precise facts, but you know before hand. thats said, i completely bombed the short answers on the first two, and i pulled off Bs.

The class is broken up into two watches, and each student is given a rank--depending on his or her maritime knowledge and experience. Prof. McCaughey becomes the Captain. Unlike the authoritarian captains of our past Bob is extremely friendly offering a great sense of humor, his extensive knowledge, and the best Socratic management style(more listening than talking) I've seen at this school.  Early on work is done within watches. As the class deals with learning unfamiliar material--such as sailing equipment, methods and how to navigate before GPS, the team structure is very helpful. After watch projects everyone begins to make websites on topics that touch on what is learned in class. This process is pretty easy, I never had made a website before(I'm not very good with computers at all) but I managed to learn how to quickly, and am coming out of a history course with a powerful new skill. After the first site everyone is given the option of working solo, in pairs or teams to make the next two. Overall this class was great, I learned a lot of new material, in a refreshing new way. Classes are fun, and much more casual than any other course I've taken. Work is not very bad, you really have the option of putting as much time as you want into the course. I highly recommend taking this course\nWorkload:\nThree websites, read two books: Two Years Before the Mast, and Moby Dick\n"

Obviously well versed in this topic (his book on CU's history will be coming out in Fall 2004), he inserts anecdotes and witty coments throughout his lectures.  I've only taken one exam, but it was pretty killer and pretty unfair because of the specificity of the questions.  How much does one really learn by memorizing lists upon lists of dates?  His readings are pretty much recaps of his lectures and his near obsession with using the internet as an educational resource translates into a requirement of two website projects.  You are free to do it on any topic that you like within a certain time period and they are actually pretty interesting and more fun to do than writing a paper.  He also puts up lecture notes online, which I've heard are useful, but I've never looked them over myself.  Overall a pretty good class, besides the exams but that's where P/D/F-ing comes in.     \nWorkload:\nReadings that are fairly interesting and easy reads, two web projects, and two exams.

Some of the material is quite interesting, but it's still a history course, complete with tons of reading (much of it written in flowery, archaic English) and timelines. Fortunately, Professor McCaughey is an enthusiastic, eloquent, and entertaining lecturer who makes some of the dull material more engaging. He also gives you the freedom to explore the Columbia-related topics that interest you most, which was what made the course worthwhile for me. All in all, this is a good class -- just don't expect to hear about the most fascinating aspects of our school's history (the revolts of '68, etc.) all the time. \nWorkload:\nUmmm ... weird. The tests are extremely difficult and essentially unfair -- they ask for tiny specific details that you might have read about once in the five billion pages assigned to you. Fortunately, there is an enormous curve, (my 77 was a B+) but why not just make the questions more general, so our original scores don't suck? You also have to complete a couple of web projects on topics of your choice, which are a lot of fun, and it's interesting to read everybody else's work as well.\n"
