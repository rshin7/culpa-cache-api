            "review_content": "\nThis class was extremely STRESSFUL and expectations are VERY VERY high. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS AS YOUR FIRST COLLOQUIUM. I took the class because I heard amazing things about Professor Autesserre and read great reviews about her on CULPA. However, the class was by no means EASY and Professor Autesserre is by far the most intense professor I have had at Barnard/Columbia. Personally, I did not think the class was enjoyable..I was miserable and dreaded going to class every week but that was because it was my first colloquium and I didn't know/care a lot about peace building. I would not recommend taking the class unless you are a) knowledgable on the subject b) took her Civil Wars class before or c) very passionate about peacebuilding in the Congo, Rwanda or former Yugoslavia. For me, it wasn't worth stress especially over a topic that I did not feel strongly about (everyone in your 16 person class will have a lot to say on peacebuilding in Africa). However, if you are seriously considering a career at the UN or in peacebuilding/peacekeeping, Professor Autesserre is knowledgable and passionate about the subject and is extremely well-regarded and well connected in the field. \nPOSITIVES:\n- The class is very organized, structured and planned which ensures that writing the research paper will not be last-minute\n- Professor Autesserre is impressive in her field and has great firsthand experience..she also brings in a lot of interesting speakers because she has impressive colleagues \n- You learn a lot about peacebuilding and the UN \nNEGATIVES: \n- The workload sucks and this class will definitely have to be your top priority \n- Professor Autesserre has very high expectations for quality of work, participation & preparation and is condescending if you don't meet those expectations \n- On average, you do much more work than most other colloquiums because there are the presentations, the mock negotiation/role play, etc. \nCONCLUSION: It is definitely doable but make sure that you are willing to invest a lot of time and energy into this class! \n\nWorkload:\nHEAVY and TIME CONSUMING: 1-2 books a week, 25-30 page research paper, presentation of research, presentation for role play, memo for the role play,  2 reading reviews (essays). You absolutely HAVE to do the reading...if you don't it's very obvious as the class is entirely discussion based and she keeps track of the amount of times you speak in class or she will you call you out on it. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI LOVE THIS PROFESSOR! I mean, not only is she one of the absolute nicest people ever, but she's also an incredible lecturer; she is so energetic and encouraging of all her students to speak up.You can really just tell she loves the subject. She also happens to be my advisor and she really just goes above and beyond, she always makes herself available if you need any help or to meet with her last minute. As for the class, it's just incredible. The way she teaches it gives you a whole new way of looking not just at African theory but also at political science theory in general, giving you the pros and limitations of every single argument or theory she presents (even the ones she favors). Even if you aren't super interested in sub-saharan African conflict and violence, take this class just to have her as a professor. And by the end of the second day, you probably will be interested anyway because it's a fascinating subject.\nWorkload:\nDecent amount of reading but absolutely nothing unmanageable. Really fair amount of work. One four page paper, a midterm 8 page paper, and an 8 page final paper.\n On weeks where papers are due she doesn't assign reading, which just shows she's not intent on drowning you in reading and ruining your life like other professors. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis is the single best class I've taken thus far in my college career! The first day of the course, Professor Autesserre will tell everyone that the class is very challenging, so those who are not ready should drop the course immediately so other students can sign up. She has the very best interests of her students in mind, but I don't think the course is too challenging at all. In fact, the amount of reading was manageable, the take-home exams do-able, and overall the material was easily understood and INTERESTING! That doesn't mean the material wasn't challenging to a certain extent, but it made the class all the more engaging. \nProfessor Autesserre is also a fantastic lecturer! Each class is jam-packed with information and super engaging - I only missed one lecture during the entire semester (for an interview). Note that they do take attendance every class though, and in every discussion section.\nDuring the first half of the semester, Professor Autesserre presents different theoretical models for understanding civil war - colonialism, economic opportunity, etc... Then, during the second half of the semester, she covers humanitarian aid, peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding. Each lecture, she also describes cases of civil wars in a few countries that exemplify these models. At the end of class, she asks students to share the strengths and weaknesses of each model, and then she shares her own perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses. \nThis structure is fantastic because it's EXACTLY what you're expected to do on the take-home exams. At the beginning of the semester, I didn't really understand what constituted a strength/weakness, but by the end of the semester I knew exactly how to perform this type of critique. The take-home exams do require a bit of outside research, but she provides an entire list of sources and you don't need anything more than that. Essentially class lectures and readings help frame your argument, and research just provides case details of civil wars in the country you're analyzing. \nDiscussion section was also great! Professor Autesserre expects the TAs to help students understand the readings during section, and then we would have a discussion about a larger question like how much aid countries like the U.S. are morally obligated to send to countries experiencing civil war. \nYou will not regret taking this class!\nWorkload:\n3 take-home exams (4 pages, 8 pages, 8 pages) - between 1 week and 2 weeks to complete them.\nAttendance/participation\n"

She's brilliant, caring, and compassionate, and worth taking just to hear her speak about her work on the ground and theories about the world.\nThe readings are totally worth it. There are a lot of them, but they are all very different, and will open you up to many perspectives about how the world/violence works. Professor Autesserre is, in addition, very good at presenting the different readings, and presents them all as if they are correct, even though she disagrees with most of them.\nThe papers are standard papers, and the TA's will help you with anything you have questions on. Would definitely recommend this class.\nWorkload:\nWeekly readings (standard), one short essay, one midterm essay, and one final essay. Pretty standard workload. \n"

S\u00c3\u00a9verine is an exceptional professor\u00e2\u20ac\u201dintelligent, challenging, prepared, knowledgeable, engaging... not to mention that she spent years in the humanitarian and development aid world prior to becoming an academic. She has done extensive research on conflict in the DRC, and was referred to by a colleague as the expert on the DRC (her colleague who she invited to come speak to our class was the representative of M\u00c3\u00a9decins Sans Frontieres to the UN for 12 years). In short, S\u00c3\u00a9verine is exceptionally knowledgeable about the humanitarian and development aid community, in theory and practice. \nIn terms of the class, you will learn about the history of humanitarian and development aid, the challenges between theory and practice, contemporary aid work and interventions, etc. Not only does the class give you a broad understanding of the field, but in-depth study on various conflicts, aid strategies, international actors, etc. This class is taught from a critical perspective, so expect to spend the majority of the time critiquing how aid is flawed and inherently problematic. Throughout the semester, S\u00c3\u00a9verine invites multiple guests to come speak to the class\u00e2\u20ac\u201dranging from an economic analyst for the UN to the MSF rep to the UN. The speakers are usually very interesting and engaging. \nAs other reviews have mentioned, yes, there is a lot of reading. But, it is not overwhelming and S\u00c3\u00a9verine does an excellent job of only assigning the sections of books which are relevant to class, pairing different texts together, pulling from a wide variety of sources, including essential readings for the field of study, and balancing challenging and easier readings. The reading reviews are not challenging and are good preparation for class discussion. \nS\u00c3\u00a9verine also does an excellent job of being available and responsive to all of her students. She is very approachable and is genuinely interested in what you have to say and in helping you understand class material or anything else you want to talk to her about. She offers individual guidance throughout the research paper process and her advice is constructive and helpful\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe seems to know about nearly every facet of humanitarian/development aid, and if she doesn't she'll help you find out. Make sure you go to her office hours for any help, she definitely wants to see you and help you in her class. \nWorkload:\n100-150 pages of readings per week\n3 reading responses: each 2 pages, single-spaced\n1 role play exercise on an intervention case study: 1-2 min. presentation and materials for in-class role play exercise\n25 page final research paper: on any topic relevant to the class\nGrading: 20% class participation, 40% three reading reviews, 40% research paper (15%=bibliography, abstract, outline; 25% final draft)\nS\u00c3\u00aaverine is a fair grader, if a bit on the easy side.\n"

Autesserre puts thought into her readings, but doesn't seem to realize that this is not the only  class her students are taking. The reading is unbearably long and dry, and once you turn in your first paper you will probably be no longer motivated to do it. Autessere has gotten the absurd idea that everything you learn in lecture and from the readings can somehow be incorporated,with your own research, into tiny 4 and 8 page papers that attempt to answer vague and difficult questions. The subject matter is interesting and it does count as Global core but the course is so poorly designed that you would  be better off staying far, far away. To top it off, Autesserre is pretty conceited and unreasonable a a grader.\nWorkload:\nRidiculous amounts of weekly reading, infuriating take-home essay exams. Kiss your social life goodbye.\n"

Severine is a knowledgeable  and dedicated professor, who is genuinely interested in challenging her students and making sure that they learn. She encouraged engaging discussions and brought in guest lecturers, without losing the focus of the topic we were discussing. I've probably learned more from this class (both about the specific topic and about poli sci as a discipline) than all the other poli sci classes I've taken, combined, and the syllabus is full of fascinating texts. You will definitely work in this class, but it's worth it!\nWorkload:\nAbout a book every week, though you can usually skim the readings. A normal colloquium paper (30p) at the end. \n"

            "review_content": "\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS. Although the material is interesting, Autesserre does not understand how to teach beyond lecturing. The mandatory weekly discussion sections were useless: the TAs had barely completed the readings themselves, let alone knew how to talk about them or about our assignments. Almost the entirety of your grade is made up of three papers, really cruel exercises in frustration: rather than giving real exams that might help you to learn the material, Autesserre opts to give one 4-page and two 8-page papers, the latter two in place of midterm and final exams. She asks such ambiguous, broad and complex questions as explaining civil war violence in Somalia or Darfur and then expects everyone to adhere to the very strict page limit or be penalized. She is unclear about what she expects from these papers, and then you are penalized for every last detail or theory you did not include because of space constraints. Beyond this, she is a completely unreasonable piece of work as a person: from the time that you find her insane \"classroom etiquette\" on courseworks (an example: if you want to use a laptop, you must sit in the last three rows of the classroom and turn in a signed contract stating that you will NEVER use your laptop in class for anything but taking notes; she makes one of the TAs sit at the top of the auditorium to spy on everyone and if you are caught, say, checking your email you are kicked out of class then and there and given an F for the 10% of your grade that is participation) to the time that you find your final work graded in violation of her own stated grading standards in the syllabus, you will be frustrated by this woman and this class. Although she feigns sympathy with her students, she takes herself far too seriously. In sum: do not take this class unless you want to spend an entire semester completely frustrated and confused!!!\nWorkload:\nHuge amounts of dry reading, one 4-page paper, 2 eight-page papers\n"

You have to apply concepts from readings and lecture material, along with independent research on a case study and present one central arguement using a thoery to critique a case, and then use the  case study to critique a theory.. it's a nice idea in practice but it doesn't really work, and does not allow for any freedom in papers or exams. Autesserre wants the exam the way she wants the exam and that's that!\nBut at the same time the class is really interesting. the professor has worked extensively in the field and tells interesting stories about her experiences on the ground. \nWorkload:\n3 take home exams- 4 pages, 8 pages and 8 pages.

Her already too-lengthy required weekly readings were supplemented by a recommended readings list. In the end, I did none of the readings and ended up with a B+ in the class. I would have done better but my final paper was a bit shoddy. The midterm and final are not that difficult; the TAs put together a review and hit upon the major points. However, during the actual lectures it is sometimes hard to follow what the main point is. You definitely have to take notes because the slides are skeletal at best and the readings are not relevant to the material on the exam, really. This class was popular with the GS students with varying backgrounds and a lot to say, so oftentimes the discussion tended to wander as they took the reigns and made references to obscure moments in African history or argued fine points of the frameworks until the whole class was rolling their eyes. That being said, a background in African history would be nice, but not mandatory. It will just mean you catch way more of the references in class, because there is no time for explanations during lecture. \nWorkload:\nLots and lots of unnecessary readings, midterm, 15-page paper, final\n"

The reading list is fabulous - Professor Autesserre hand-picked engaging texts that allow you to really understand the aid enterprise and its effects (shockingly negative). It focuses on Africa, but she assigns readings that have to do with other humanitarian crises around the world (former Yugoslavia, India, etc). The work is pretty standard for a colloquium and there is a 25 pg paper on humanitarian aid/development due at the end of the semester. What is great about the paper is that you can write about any aspect of aid/development you want on any place on earth, not only Africa. Make sure to do all the readings because the discussion is entirely class based, she neatly summarizes the readings/main points of the discussion at the end of the class. Professer Autesserre also brings a lot of great guest speakers to class - for example she got a UN development worker, an Action Against Hunger officer, and a Doctors Without Borders representative to speak to us throughout the semester. Overall, it was a very enjoyable class that completely changed my outlook on the humanitarian field.\nWorkload:\nstandard colloquium readings (moderate-heavy), 25-30pg paper, 3 reading summaries that you can submit for whichever weekly readings you choose\n"
