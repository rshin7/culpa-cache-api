The texts we read are really interesting and he can make any stupid comment you make in class sound accidentally brilliant. \nWorkload is fair, readings might lean toward the heavy side/be difficult at times, but he always asks you in class the next day if the reading was too hard, and is very accommodating. Grading is also very fair. If you are lucky enough to find an available spot in his class, TAKE HIS CLASS. \nWorkload:\nAgain, very fair, sometimes the work/reading is a bit heavy but he's really accommodating about it. Sometimes the homework is just to watch a really interesting movie in Spanish and write a small composition about it. The work is always very manageable. \n"

            "review_content": "\nIt hurts me that Profesor Colmenares hasn't had a review yet. He's the sweetest person you'll ever meet. You kind of just want to hug him every time you see him. He's incredibly approachable and friendly, a very, very fair grader, and is really helpful when you approach him outside of class. I was in his seminar class and there were only around 10 people in it, so it was a very nice, open dynamic. You feel like you're just having a conversation with him in class. There were Spanish speakers of every level in the class, and Profesor Colmenares really made the effort to accommodate everybody and make everyone feel comfortable. He's just phenomenal. \n\nWorkload:\nFair. Usually it's a semi-long academic article in Spanish, but usually the language isn't especially difficult. The length can be a pain, and usually you either have to answer his gu\u00c3\u00adas de lecture or write a composition about it, but it's always doable. I usually did mine the night before. \n"
