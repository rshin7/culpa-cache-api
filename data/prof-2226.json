As a native French speaker, he is sometimes kind of unintelligable in English, but English is rarely spoken in class so that's not much of a problem.\nWorkload:\ndaily assignments (which you don't really have to do), small weekly grammar quizzes, larger bi-weekly grammar/vocab tests, 5 small papers, and final.  totally manageable.\n"

You listen to music, watch movie trailers, and talk about different subjects in french all class.  You definitely speak french alot.  Also, you end up learning a lot of tongue twisters.  And if you are even slightly good at french, you can pretty much guarantee that you'll get a B with little to no effort.\ni'd definitely recommend taking this class.\nWorkload:\nweekly quizzes on vocab (easy), a test every two chapters (fairly easy), and you have to go to the french house to watch a movie that your class agrees upon one a month; in terms of homework, just memorizing vocabulary and some busywork that you don't really have to do (you can just bs it in class)\n"
