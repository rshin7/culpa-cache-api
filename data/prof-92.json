(okay, i'm a little ashamed. i'm only 21.)\ni was in Foner's course on American radical movements last semester and it blew my mind. it was the only course where i genuinely enjoyed every lecture, because Foner is brilliant and his lectures were both accessible and entertaining. i also got a kick out of the fact that unlike many other professors (including ones at Barnard, who teach much smaller but still large introductory courses), he actually made a point of meeting with all of the students in that ENORMOUS lecture class who were registered with Disability Services and needed test accommodations forms signed. he was really congenial and very nice about it (considering he didn't really have interactions with most students in that course), so it was unexpected but very cool. but i digress.\ni somehow managed to convince him i was worthy of being in his seminar on Slavery and Emancipation; needless to say i was thrilled that i would get to bask in his glory, at such close range no less! if you have heard anything about Foner, you know that the Civil War and Abe Lincoln are his shit, so to be in a lecture devoted to these topics is such a treat (for lack of a better, less-hokey word). you can tell how much he loves this stuff and how he genuinely still gets something out of discussion with his students. the class is challenging, but everything is explained and dealt with in-depth. Foner drops multiple knowledge bombs on you each class, and it is awesome.\nFoner is also a true g. he regularly brings in contemporary issues and provides delightful personal anecdotes on conservative politics (which can be summed up as \"oy vey\" due to his profound disapproval), the Columbia scholars (and otherwise) of yore, and current events. he is also bringing our class to go see the Steven Spielberg \"Lincoln\" movie and feeding us pizza afterwards! date night with a Pulitzer-Prize winner! u jelly?\nby the way - DO go see him during his office hours. aside from the fact that his eyes sort of light up when someone comes to see him during that time (you would think more people would come, but they are probably just intimidated by his badassery), and that he has the most epic office in existence (SWORDS!!), he takes the time to talk to and get to know you. he's really great. (i may be biased though)\nthe man is, as we say, a true mensch.\nWorkload:\na book a week, many of which are hella long. each class one person writes three pages and presents on the week's reading. this is a seminar with the God of American history - one does not simply SKIP the reading for his seminar.\n15 page final paper comparing 4 books. a huge pain in the butt to deal with, but oddly fulfilling nonetheless.\n"

He's certainly the best I've had, and this comes from a history major who makes a point of filling her electives with 3000+ level history classes. \nPeople can say whatever they want about Foner's political predilections - and he's certainly far to the left of \"mainstream America\" (whatever that means), myself included.

Professor Foner is an absolute leader in this field, and it is a privilege to take a class with him. Each lecture focuses on one pretty narrow topic, such as the Southern antebellum economy or Northern patriotism in 1863, and the class is impeccably organized. Every class, Professor Foner stands just next to the podium, and talks to the class very conversationally, glancing at his notes once or twice the whole class. He talks so easily, at the end of each class, it's hard to believe it's been 75 minutes. The class is wonderful, and Columbia is very lucky to have Professor Foner on faculty. \nWorkload:\nThere is a lot of reading, but it is very interesting and it is chosen very judiciously. That is to say, Professor Foner doesn't assign reading just to assign it- it is all very relevant to class and goes very nicely with the lectures. Although students can get away with skipping some of the reading, doing the reading is a huge advantage in class and in the discussion sections. The midterm is one essay, very straightforward and concerning something we had talked about a lot in class and discussion. The final was a little harder, and it required studying, but there were no real surprises on it. Also, one 10-12 page paper that required us to read books not on the syllabus. It was kind of pain to read the extra books, but we could pick the books and the topic of the paper. Discussion section also requires weekly posts over the readings, but these are not a big deal at all. \n"

            "review_content": "\nEric Foner has a cult following at Columbia, and although his lectures are interesting and he synthesizes well, this class was definitely not one of my favorite of all time and pales in comparison to the style of Alan Brinkley (with whom I took America Since 1945).  A lot of this comes down to the assignments and the TA whom I had.  My main complaint with this course was its often oppressive focus on historiography rather than the actual tracing and significance of historical events.  So much time was spent talking about how authors perceived things and how authors\u00c2\u2019 points of views compared to each other\u00c2\u2019s that a lot of the importance of the material was lost.  Granted, historiography and an awareness of the author\u00c2\u2019s perspective are useful skills to history students, but the concentration of time spent on such things in this class was far too much.  For the paper, we had to read two works on the same subject and compare the authors\u00c2\u2019 analyses.  Besides the fact that this was a god-awful amount of work that prevented me from doing well in my other classes, I found myself reading two books on a subject about which I was interested by just skimming for differences instead of indulging my curiosity on the topic.  Thus, the paper became less interesting and more difficult to complete.  The same was true about the books we read for the course\u00c2\u2014the section was spent talking about the author\u00c2\u2019s opinion more than the historical period.  I learned a lot about picking an argument out of a text, but retained very little about the U.S. in the era of slavery and Jacksonian democracy.\nMy other complaint with this class was my TA's grading standards.  I am a history major who has taken many other classes in this style, and always get A\u00c2\u2019s/A-\u00c2\u2019s depending on the level of work I do.  In this class, I worked harder than I ever had before in a history lecture, participated the most in my section, and spent two solid weeks working on my paper (thereby causing my grade in another class to drop by a full letter)\u00c2\u2026 and still received a B+.  I am certain that if I had been graded by anyone else\u00c2\u2019s standards I would have gotten an A/A-.  This may have been specific to my TA, however.\nWorkload:\nExtremely time-consuming historiography paper that caused me to neglect my other courses.  Midterm and final, standard for large history lectures.  Huge focus on who said what, so you'll need to memorize what the authors stay (1 whole book or parts of a book each week).\n"

His erudition is quite impressive and I did not find him to be egoistic or prone to \"self-aggrandizement\" In fact, Foner was actually quite humble and spoke of many other great history scholars. His viewpoints are interesting, creative and unique. He will get you thinking in new ways. My only complaint is that the TA's grade everything and are quite unfair and unreasonable. My entire section and other sections shared this sentiment as well as other friends of mine who took his courses in the past. Given the large number of students he can't grade himself. Talking to the TA's about the grades is useless because they will never change them instead you are told that the average class grade was a B- so anything above consider yourself lucky. Grading for papers was even worse. Foner is a great prof but if you want anything close to an A prepare to be disappointed----even with breaking your A-S all semester \nWorkload:\nModerate.

He spends the beginning of class connecting history with the current news and then goes through with his lectures often citing historiography and providing interesting tangential tidbits while giving rather broad overviews of topics. At first I thought there wasn't much you could get out of his lectures that wasn't in textbooks or hadn't been said before but then I realized the way he treats historiography, addresses topics and presents his own views and arguments subtlely is actually quite impressive. It also must be noted that he perhaps influenced much of the knowledge we have on some of these topics himself to begin with. I have to give him credit that I never really once was bored in his class despite a few what would seem to be dry and what should have become repetitive topics. He truly is a great professor and historian who is not overwhelmed by his own ego (as many highly-rated professors are) and can be understood by a student with a casual interest in history or a history major already familiar with much about the time period. If you think this period is boring, you should still consider this class because I expected to be a dull period and it has now actually become one of my favorites. He does a great job of choosing books and lecture topics.\nWorkload:\nAbout 150 pages of reading per week but it all seems to be quite useful and interesting material if you are into history. A 10-12 page historiography paper which requires you to read two extra books but is relatively straight forward. A midterm with a choice of some pretty general essay topics and final with some primary source quote IDs and separate choices for two essays which you will not have seen beforehand. Guess grading depends on the TA but the material wasn't particularly hard and the TAs seemed to grade quite fairly. \n"

The discussion section for this class was the only productive section i've had in my three years here; Courtney was really good at focusing the discussing and leading us to draw connections between the movements.\nWorkload:\nHeavy reading (though you can skim the stuff that doesn't really interest you and draw on lecture notes for exams), one paper, midterm & final, fairly graded; a short presentation in discussion section on a movement of your choice. \n"

Foner, a great writer and important scholar, caters to the absolutely lowest common denominator in his lectures, which means you can skip them if you either know something about the time period or plan on doing the reading, which is substantial. The advantage to taking this class from a history major's perspective is being able to read the books on the list (some of which are skippable) and being able to go to his office hours. The great disappointment is that all of his lectures on Reconstruction, his specialty, come straight out of his book, which you can read on your own instead of listening to him read to you. The other students in the class are mostly non-history majors who don't do the reading and think he's an amazing lecturer because he's got a little personality and tells them things they should already know. If you want your money's worth, do the reading and pick his brain during office hours so that you can do more interesting things during class time. \nWorkload:\nA bunch of worthwhile reading (150-200 pages a week), a midterm which doesn't really count, a 10-12 page paper which requires you to read two books outside of the curriculum (very time-consuming), and a final which counts for a big part of your grade.
