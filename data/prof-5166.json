That aside, he is a great, energetic, charismatic professor who gets students engaged in the subject matter and goes at a reasonable pace. It is a workload but it is tolerable. Only complaint was accessibility outside the classroom. He seems to just wanna teach the class and go home and not make his office hours too plentiful. But if you pay attention and take notes, you won't really need the office hours.\nWorkload:\nSubstantial but fair and reasonable.\n"
