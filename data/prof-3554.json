Consider yourself blessed by an angel if you get him, because judging from the comments other people make about their UW teachers, Bryan Lowrance is a godsend. And this is no joke. Not only will he help you every step of the writing process, but he'll give you feedback that is specifically catered to your weaknesses as a writer. He also has a BRILLIANT command of language and he's insanely hilarious. But don't take him for granted. He knows his stuff and that's what really makes the class.\nWorkload:\n3-4 essays, weekly exercises for HW. \n"

He grades fairly, he is insightful and gives you a lot of feedback with your work. He knows exactly what you're trying to say in essays, even if you're entirely incoherent and he knows how to fix it. I would highly recommend Bryan to anyone who wants a university writing class that won't make your mind explode. He's also hilarious, just to make a 9:00am class worth coming to. But don't take him for granted**He knows his stuff and that's why you got to love him. \nWorkload:\nVery Very fair. 3-4 essays, fair amount of reading, interesting topics. Perhaps one quiz, but reasonable if you read the work.\n"
