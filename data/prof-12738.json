When I first met Chris in class I thought he was a literature nerd being that he is currently working on his doctoral dissertation in Classic Literature and that would transpire to him being a writing Nazi or at minimum, a snob. This worried me because I come from a background in the military where we hardly ever wrote anything, so my writing was massively lacking in every way. Chris was turned out to be friendly and extremely personable and approachable. I met with Chris several times and every question I had he was extremely helpful in answering. He had great insight into writing and what I needed to do to improve. His comments and suggestions made sense and I was able to understand what he meant and then apply it. I feel my writing has improved tremendously thanks to him. I am very thankful I was lucky enough to have him as a professor. I have already recommended him to my friends.Despite his demanding schedule working on his own writing, he was very timely in responding to emails and always willing to meet, even outside of office hours. His obvious flexibility was perfect for the GS/non-traditional students he taught. We all respected him greatly (even though he is younger than a few of us, myself included).\nTAKE HIS COURSE.\nWorkload:\nOften a short reading for most classes to be discussed and briefly written about in class, but no homework assigned writing. \nFour progressions of writings: 1) 1500-1800 words 2) 1800-2400 words 3) 2500-3000 words 4) Op-Ed piece therefore it depended.\nAt the end of the course you are allowed to revise and re-submit one of your first two essays for a new grade.\n"
