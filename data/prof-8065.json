            "review_content": "\nHow to even begin? I guess I should start by saying I'm an Art History Major. I know I know, why the f*%& am I taking this class? There's a very simple answer to that: WEI. ZHANG. I know it sounds cliche but this guy is the single best professor I've ever had. After his class, I etched his name on the mini Butler Library I have at home -- screw Demosthenes, Zhang has taken his place in the pantheon of legends. Zhang opened my eyes to the language of numbers, the intricate beauty of angles and the biting logic of his spectacular proofs. His poets were Euler and Lagrange. The numbers were flying off the board and fluttering all around me in a resplendent symphony. After his class, I was thinking in numbers. Math had entered my life. \nHave you ever walked out of class thinking, \"What the hell did that guy just say?\" Well with Wei, you can put those days behind you. The clarity with which Zhang presents the material -- it's like Sparknotes for Calc. And the preparation, my god. He takes difficult-to-grasp concepts and makes them accessible to the mathematically challenged among us. His homework is short but teaches you everything to know. That's a godsend when the other professors are giving twice or three times the number of problems. He gives a Webassign every week but gives you six tries for each problem (for multiple choice, you literally can't get it wrong) so you're guaranteed 100's. There's also a written homework every week but he's a generous grader.  \nNow we all know that effectiveness is only one half of the battle -- we want personality. And Zhang has it in spades. The guy is never without a smile or a kind word, and is more than happy to take questions from the crowd. The banter that goes on really made this class not only one where I learned a tremendous amount but also actually enjoyed going to. His personal anecdotes are flat-out hilarious, and his Math puns are out of control.\nIf you are on the fence about taking Calculus III, hop off. Don't settle for any of the other professors -- ZHANG IS WORTH THE WAIT. And don't feel down if you're high on the waitlist, I was 38 and somehow got in (out of a total waitlist of 108 - for perspective, the other guy teaching in this time slot had 42 in his whole class, never mind a waitlist). Wei Zhang is not a mere man in my mind. His expertise, kindness, and all-around awesomeness propel him to the realm of the teaching gods. I think it was Rousseau who said, \"A great teacher can kindle flames that never die, open a well that will never dry, and move your dreams from earth to the sky.\" Well Zhang is just that teacher. Prepare to Hang out with Your Zhang out.\nWorkload:\nWritten HW: 10%\nWebAssign: 10% (6 freaking tries per question, with an option for \"Sample Solutions\" -- you know the drill)\n2 Midterms: 20%x2 (and he has this saving algorithm that has literally rescued lost souls from the depths of math hell)\nFinal: 40%\n"

            "review_content": "\nMuch of what I have to say about Wei has been written in someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review. Thank you for having such a good review of Wei Zhang! People like Wei are really an asset to Columbia University and to the math world. I am writing this review to let more people know Wei, who is without a doubt the best professor I have ever encountered in my years in Columbia and is indisputably one of the academic superstars in the 21st century, at least in the realm of math. He is like the Judith Butler or Geoffrey Sachs in math or something. \nI originally took this class rather unwillingly to fulfill my ECON credit, but it turns out to be the best class of my life! Wei is so inspirational! When he talks, you feel like you are transported to the world of mathematics. His class is fun even for people who are not interested in math or science, like me. During his class, you suspend all your disbelief about math. You just buckle your seat belts and get ready for the wondrous journey that Wei takes you! I probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pursue math major in the end because Wei Zhang only teaches Cal 3. If he teaches more math classes, I will seriously consider majoring in math!!\nDef take his class even if you are a history or English major. This class totally changes my perception of math and science. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a treasure for all!\n\nWorkload:\nVery light. Who cares about the workload when Wei is so brilliant?\n"

            "review_content": "\nNot being a math major, I do not share the same passion as the review below but I'll give my two cents.  Im an econ major so Calc 3 was required.  Honestly take Zhang.  He doesn't do Webassign because he sees no point in it.  He goes at a slower pace which is fine.  He gives out practice problems before the midterms which are very similar to the midterms.  I have only heard horror stories about the other Calculus teachers.  He is very approachable and will make time for you if you email in advanced.  He is nothing extraordinary but is probably the best section to take.  \nWorkload:\nWeekly HW (20%) about 10 questions that are pretty easy.\n2 Midterms (20% each)\nFinal (40%)\n"

            "review_content": "\nTake his class, take his class, take his class. One of the most rewarding/intellectually stimulating classes offered here at Columbia.\nWei Zhang is one of the most incredible mathematicians alive. He is a bona fide Ivy League professor who has unlimited knowledge of everything in math. He exudes such gravitas that we would automatically fall silent and clung to his every word the moment he walked into class, because he is amazing. Not only does he explain concepts in the clearest possible way, but he also does it in the most awe-inspiring way. Because of him, I'm now a math major.\nThroughout the semester, Prof. Zhang is very approachable and understanding. He always comes to class with a big smile on his face and is always willing to take questions. Not condescending as some other profs are, which is always a plus! Also, definitely make time for his office hours. It may sound intimidating given that he is such a busy and legendary mathematician, but once you walk in to introduce yourself, the legend becomes a normal human being who cares about you and your intellectual development.\nProf. Zhang does such a great job explaining everything that you don't have to panic at all when it comes to exams. Just do the homework and study for a couple hours and you'll be fine. \nThe fact that he does not yet have stellar reviews is the most atrocious thing I've encountered as a student. I'm sure Wei Zhang will get his deserved gold nugget in no time!\nWorkload:\nLight, but I got a lot out of it.\n"

Wei Zhang is smart, energetic, and you can really tell, he cares about his students. Some people say they can't understand his English, but his English is actually very clear, and even adorable.\nHis class is totally manageable. If you still haven't understood everything from his marvelous class, which is really impossible, do his homework, which is light but effective. You are allowed to drop 2 homework for his class.\nExam for this class is easy and his grading is extremely fair. \nIn a word, he is perfect! Definitely take his class!\nWorkload:\nManageable. Weekly homework. 2 midterms 1 final. \n"
