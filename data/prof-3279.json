            "review_content": "\nMr. Rooks was visiting from Harvard last semester when I took her class, but I enjoyed having her as a professor.  There are no objecite tests, only writings and a short discussion on the book of your choice. The class leaves you room to go without reading some material that maybe you are not interested in.  You mostly need to know the main concepts and how to analize your thoughts into an essay. As long as you can handle learning basic concepts, develop your thoughts, and write a decent essay, you will do well in the class. \nWorkload:\nFifteen minute presentation of ideas on the book of your choice to start discussion, nothing major.  Two 5-7 page papers and a 12-15 page final on the topic of your choice and using the books of your choice.  Her flexibility makes the class enjoyable and less stressful. She encourages you to think for yourself and enjoy your work. I highly recommmend her. \n"
