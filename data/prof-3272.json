            "review_content": "\nIf you find yourself placed into Patrick's lit hum section, you're in luck. \nI agree with all the past reviewers who emphasized Patrick's cheerful disposition and a willingness to engage his students. But in the end, your experience in lit hum all depends on what YOU want to get out of the class (and Patrick).\nContrary to the previous reviewer, I was in his 9:00 to 10:50 am section, so people were either half asleep or didn't bother to show up. No matter - I really don't think Patrick gave a rat's fart either. Discussion for the first two books are going to be amazing, because people actually have time to do the readings (or have already read the Aeneid in high school). Except by the time April rolls around, you're basically assigned to read 100+ pages a night, which no one does, and subsequently, discussion becomes....what, did I say discussion? What I really meant was Patrick posing a thoughtful question to a class full of students staring blankly, pausing for a couple of seconds, and then broke the awkwardness with a smile and an answer to his own question. It's in situations like these that makes me feel guilty for not doing the required reading.\nOh, and Patrick takes a HELLISH long time to return any assignments. We didn't get our midterm grades until mid-April, and by the time he finished grading our final papers, everyone already moved out of their dorms.\nOther than that, Patrick's a pretty easygoing instructor. His grading is just as liberal as his personality; most of my friends got As on the midterm on the papers. I ended up getting an A in the class, and chances are, you probably will too.\n\nWorkload:\n1st paper: 4-5 pages\nMidterm (basically a shorter version of the final.)\n2nd paper: 7-8 pages\nFinal\n*The dude's not a hard grader, and he actually gives very good feedback on essays. Put some thought into them...and you'll be fine. \n"

            "review_content": "\nPatrick is this hilariously weird, kind of troll-ish classics dude with seriously impressive knowledge about literature. He's really casual and friendly, although this came back to bite him in the ass in some ways. My class was particularly apathetic, perhaps as a result of our 6:10-8:00 time slot, and Patrick does not prohibit laptops in his class, nor does he care about attendance. I would say 12/20 people brought their laptops every day and never said a word. Class would frequently be interrupted by the Facebook chat sound or the Skype sound followed by the frantic Macbook volume-down sound, as if Patrick had no idea what they were doing for 2 hours instead of participating. \nOf course, this is mostly the students' fault for not taking advantage of such a bright professor as Patrick. That being said, his discussion-leading style was a bit off putting at times. He would sometimes bring up really deep, difficult questions about large themes and wait for someone to respond\u00e2\u20ac\u201cobviously no one wants to expound extemporaneously about the nature of identity in Don Quixote or whatever, so often silence would follow. Other times he would ask something really obvious that could only be answered with a yes or no question. A bit puzzling. Occasionally I would fall in love with a book we were reading (Ovid, Woolf) and those discussions were fantastic and enjoyable. Mostly though, they were just meh\u00e2\u20ac\u201cwhich is partly my classmates' fault and partly Patrick's. \nHe assigns two essays per semester, both of which are graded insanely easily, as are his exams. The topics for the essays are stimulating, but he invites you to make your own, with his approval (which was quite fun actually). As far as I know, I did not receive any grade lower than an A on any assignment. I got an A both semesters.\nAlso, he likes to add in another text 2nd semester. We had the option of reading Paradise Lost, Paradiso, or various others. We voted to read Nabokov's Lolita, which was great fun.\nOverall, Patrick is a really good professor, super willing to talk even outside of office hours and capable of generating real intellectual excitement at times. Just pray that your class is self-directed enough not to slack off.\nWorkload:\nTwo essays (one ~6 pages, one ~8 pages), graded extremely liberally. Midterm and final, likewise.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis review is overdue from Spring '12 - Elementary Latin II.  I liked Patrick a lot; he was funny, easy going, not fussy.  He knows his stuff and wants us to learn Latin sufficiently well so that we can appreciate the value of translating the works of great authors.  He's a stickler for having things written out perfectly on a quiz/test so memorize, memorize, memorize.  The class is relaxed, and he won't call you out when you're translating in class.  I definitely learned a lot in a stress-free class. If you're like me and feel particularly challenged when learning a language, stick with Latin.  There is no speaking or listening...just reading.\nWorkload:\nTons of daily memorization\nWeekly grammar and translation quiz\nTests at the end of each chapter\nMidterm at the end of several chapters\nIt's a language so the workload will always be cumulative.\n"

Apart from the 10-12 page final paper he sprung on us at the end of the semester, I really have no complaints (even for that he was very generous in terms of providing a number of different paper topics and ideas).  If you like Latin, you'll like Professor Glauthier.\nWorkload:\nAbout a chapter and a half of translation every class, plus secondary source articles (which most people didn't read except whoever happened to be presenting that day).  One article presentation, reasonable midterm and final (not cumulative), and one 10-12 page final paper.\n"

He knows Greek, loves all the classics, teaches with energy and humor, finds original ways to connect the texts across themes and language, proposes thought-provoking essay topics, and gives just two essays per semester with only one short writing assignment.  His passion for the literature breathes life into a class which many of my peers found reported to be stale and tedious.  Always responds well to student interpretation, feeds off our comments and helps people to understand the underlying questions at the core of writing, from Homer to Dostoevsky.  He is an exceptional teacher, young and bright.  Consider yourself extremely fortunate to be a part of his class.\nWorkload:\nlit hum reading, two six page, two 9 page essays total in both semesters, oral presentation, and THAT'S IT.  he is all about teaching with SPIRIT AND VIGOR, SON. \n"

            "review_content": "\nPatrick is awesome. His quirky sense of humor and adorable teaching style make class fairly enjoyable. We were forced to rush through many of the books (especially second semester) due to the tight scheduling of lit hum, but Patrick was able to extract the main issues in the novels and present them to the class. \nSome people had a problem with Patrick's style of teaching. Most of our classes consisted of class discussion in which only a few people participated, with Patrick facilitating the discussion. However, this seems like an issue with the students in the class more than the teacher, and I personally did not usually find class time boring. If you participate, class is more interesting and goes by much more quickly.\nHe's always available in office hours and is totally willing to help with any issues students may have, whether they are lit hum-related or not. If you're his class, you're lucky! Definitely stick with him.\nWorkload:\nstandard lit hum reading, plus one extra text per semester (for us he added clouds first semester and lolita second)\nmidterm and lit hum-wide final\n"

            "review_content": "\nAfter having had experience with a few Classics grad students, I can enthusiastically recommend taking Intensive Latin with Patrick.  The issues that the earlier review suggests he might have had as a result of inexperience seem to have disappeared (or perhaps he is more comfortable in Latin than in Greek?).  He thoroughly knows the material he is teaching, his quizzes and exams are fair, and, most importantly, one learns the material exceptionally well, which, after all, is the most important question to be asked about an introductory language course.  \nAs evidence: Several of us in Patrick's section of Intensive Latin went the next semester into Latin 1201. Based on my observations, we were much better prepared than both the students who had taken the year-long sequence (with a professor) and the students who had taken four years of Latin in high school.\nWorkload:\nSurprisingly, not as heavy as I expected.  \nThe pace takes a couple weeks to get used to. Largely the workload depends on how fast one memorizes things.  \nEvery other class we had a quiz that consisted of three components:\n(1) For each quiz we were asked to learn 50 vocabulary items.  5 Latin words would be given on the quiz and we would have to produce an English translation.\n(2) 5 verbs or nouns to put into a specific tense or case. \n(3) 1-2 sentences in Latin involving vocabulary and grammar from that unit to translate into English.\nEach class, we were assigned exercises from the book (Moreland/Fleischer, Latin: An Intensive Course) to practice with, but whether those were actually done or not was up to the individual student's discretion (though we went over each of them the next class). In terms of actual homework that HAD to be done and turned in, there was pretty much nothing--\njust one or two ungraded English to Latin sentences every other class.\nThere were 2 midterms and a final, all the same format as the quizzes, though obviously on a much larger scale, and there were substantial extra-credit opportunities for students willing to do the work.\n"

            "review_content": "\nPatrick, a new teacher, is still getting the hang of teaching to some degree.  Class consisted of him copying a chapter of the book directly onto the board.  Combined with weekly quizes that can range from the easy to the absurd, you will have to practice on your own to learn the language.  All this said, while you do not really learn the language as well as with more experienced classes, the class is fun.  You can lead the conversation in any direction you really want to, even if it isn't about Greek.  Combined with Patrick's energetic and enthusiastic teaching style, his class stands in sharp contrast to the stuffy teaching methods of some Classicists. \nWorkload:\nThe Workload is medium.  A hard midterm and Final, but you can cushion your grade with easy weekly quizes and homework that is gone over in class before being handed in\n"
