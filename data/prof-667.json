But the readings shouldn't even matter on your decision because it is MARGARET VANDENBURG. She is the most kind, funny, INTELLIGENT and engaging professor ever. She will make you feel more intelligent than you think you are by always encouraging you to speak. She will destroy every concept you think you have (like \"do you believe in nature?\" \"like, trees?\" \"yes, do you believe in it?\" I USED TO NOW I DON'T KNOW QUEEN  ???) and you will leave the class a lot smarter I promise. I can't even put into words how amazing she is. Fair grader and her comments are actually helpful. The class was so much fun and I wish I could take it again. She even took us on a class field trip on reading week just because. My writing improved and you are pretty free to explore something you are interested in in this class. Take the class, you won't regret it!\nWorkload:\nI got an A on the class. 2 essays about the texts and books we read in the period before the due date, 1 essay identifying a tipping point and 1 essay \"solving\" that tipping point. All the deadlines are spaced out somewhat evenly. The first two have a first draft that you have to hand in and she'll correct it but not grade it. She drops the lowest grade out of the 4. About 5 books to read and a bunch of like 5 page texts. Not a lot of reading but enough to be necessary to set a time to do it. Do the reading! \n"

I believe that Professor Vandenburg is very good at explaining concepts in a way that makes them easy to understand, but there are certain times where she mentions points that are not necessarily covered in class and are sometimes hard to understand if you don't have the basis down already. That being said, she is very open to meeting and discussing papers and concepts during her office hours. \nI would recommend this class if you're looking for something to fulfill your literature requirement, and you enjoy modernist pieces. The concepts can sometimes be difficult, but overall the workload is manageable (midterm paper, final paper, 2 page take-home final). \nWorkload:\n1 4-5 page midterm \n1 7-8 page research paper\n1 2 page take home final\n"

First I'll support the many, many previous reviews that attest to how incredible Vandenburg is as a professor, a teacher, and person. Her content is interesting and challenging without being impossible, and in addition, she is ALWAYS there for students outside of office hours. \nThe important additional claim that I want to make, however, is about how \"phallic\" or whatever her course is. As past reviewers have pointed out, Vandenburg likes Freud and Lacan, argues that Virginia Woolf embeds androgyny in To The Lighthouse, etc. The thing that people seem to forget is that while it's clearly true that \"androgyny\" is Vandenburg's main theoretical interest, she is not teaching Modernism because she loves imposing weird Freudian imagery onto literature. She is teaching Modernism because the Modernists ACTUALLY WERE a group of people who literally read and wrote about Freud ALL THE TIME, and WERE unhealthily obsessed with the phallus and escaping femininity (or, for the few women, with escaping the phallus). This can be attested to, if you don't \"see it\" in their books, by the actual books that the Modernists read, by their letters, etc. In other words, it might be that Freud isn't your cup of tea -- Cool. You don't have to be a Modernist. You should still probably read their works through, because they're fucking great.\nTL;DR: #sorrynotsorry if you thought that Virginia Woolf was someone you could comfortably read out loud in your book club over tea. Yes, that scene really is about ejaculation. \nWorkload:\nIf you sit in the back, you don't have to do the reading. She will suspect, however, that you might not be doing the reading.\n"

            "review_content": "\nMargaret Vandenburg changed the way I think. Vandenburg's lectures and guidance on essays led me to understand and appreciate the potential for the transcendence of the violent and limiting system of binary opposition. Although her angle on the texts that we read focuses on gender and preaches a move towards androgyny, this notion of fusing opposites the create completeness can be applied to almost anything (i.e. race, time).\nMoreover, I disagree with reviews that say she is not open to different interpretations of the texts. People brought in many different ideas in lecture which she readily accepted and sought to expand upon. \nAs a grader, she is fair. For every essay you write EMBRACE AMBIVALENCE RATHER THAN FIXITY. Seriously. When in doubt, remember the underlying philosophy of the class is that the slipperiness of meaning and theory should be embraced rather than feared. She appreciates effort and deep thinking. Go talk out ideas in her office. She may seem intimidating on the first day but she is incredibly warm, understanding and interesting. \nDon't worry about the final. I studied for maybe 20 minutes and got an A. Just go over passages discussed in class. Doing well requires that you get your money's worth and GO TO CLASS! Also DO THE READINGS! \n\nWorkload:\nAbout a book per week. You don't need to read every one in crazy depth, just the ones you write about about. \n2 essays graded fairly. Plan ahead so you have time to discuss your ideas in her office hours. This was very helpful. The research essay is kind of confusing because she wants you to bring in two disciplines apart from literature, but she is more lenient about this than you would think. \nFinal is really straight foward and easy. IDs and an essay with the question given out weeks in advance. Just keep up with the reading as you go along and maybe make up some of it finals week if necessary. \nNot bad at all. \n"

Yes, she has a very specific niche take on literature and on Modernist literature especially, but it's one that's worth hearing in her words. This course was one of my all-time favorites and (after spending about fifteen minutes at the beginning of each class working my brain into a mode that fully grasped everything she said) I left most of the lectures with a new perspective not only on the books we were reading but on the political and cultural climate of the first half of the nineteenth century and on the authors and their legacies. To be completely honest, I left most of the lectures feeling like my mind had been blown in a number of ways. It's hard to go straight to another class right after Vandenburg's finishes. It's a very specific, strange and amazing experience if you do the reading, listen hard and love the works.\nThe one frustrating part of this course is the participation credit. Vandenburg likes comments and class discussion but the class is not small (about 70-80 students) and the discussion is generally overpowered by two or three students. A vast majority of students never speak during class, but Vandenburg seems to expect everyone to engage in the discussion.\nThe assignments are wide open and therefore a little intimidating, but Vandenburg is incredibly approachable and interested in her students and their ideas. Her office hours are mobbed but certainly worth attending.\nWorkload:\n2 papers, fairly graded, and a low-key final with short answers and an essay.\n"

On the other hand, when talking about the texts herself it seems that everything is either phallic or androgynous. When the class seemed confused she would attempt to draw a diagram on the board, which tended to make the class even more confused. It often consisted of drawing a circle, and then coloring it in or writing two words on the board and connecting them with a line. One might call that line a phallus, but only if one were Professor Vandenburg. \nThat being said, the texts we talk about in this class are nothing short of brilliant, and if you have an interest in complex literature this is the class for you. \nWorkload:\nAbout a book a week, one 4-6 pg midterm paper, one 8-10 pg final paper, and one final exam. \n"

I once left her Post 1945 lit class, only to hear a girl in front of me go on and on about how she felt class was like a \"Vandenburg Time Warp,\" and that she \"felt bad for Margaret..\" something about how she must be so intellectually plagued, swimming in philosophical appendices. Margaret is brilliant, not so much because she is, actually a brilliant mind, but because she is a brilliant person. Her personality radiates. Yes, lectures invoke literary/critical/philosophical theory; and yes her delivery of the material may be interpreted as presumptuous (i.e, kant, lacan, barthes, freud, etc are constantly lingering behind discussion). If I wasn't a Philosophy major, particularly inclined to \"connections,\" applicable theory, further understanding, I don't know if I would have enjoyed the class nearly as much. \nAlso, Prof Vandenburg has a clear view point, a particular, consistent edge. You know..the whole feminist liberal thing. If you aren't sympathetic to/tolerant of to these ideas, class may be frustrating to you.\nBut back to the important part: there is not one iota of Professor Vandenburg's presence and disposition that is condescending or pretentious. The fact that the majority of her students, ... and there is a cult...., are just as intellectually and theoretically stimulated as Margaret, is tantamount to her class engagement). It is often students who provoke discussion. It is amazing how much lecture time is spent in class discussion (a class of 60+). Professor Vandenburg is incredibly interested in and committed to understanding students remarks and responses. She comes to class to learn. You always see her writing down students comments.\nMargaret is also the most welcoming, devoted, and responsible professor I have ever had. If you go into her office hours, you will both leave knowing something about the other as individuals - not so much as teacher, as student. \nShe is just an incredibly positive force. \nWorkload:\n2 5-7 page papers, a benign final exam\n"

While I learned a lot about literary theory and the reading list is extraordinary, Professor Vandenburg is too set on a specific way of analyzing texts, to the extent that her analysis can become repetitive and--to some members of the class--slightly ridiculous. For instance, I heard a number of people outside of class criticize how she looks at everything from a Lacanian, poststructuralist or Freudian perspective. Don't get me wrong, Professor Vandenburg is clearly brilliant and knows what she's talking about, but sometimes it felt like every single text on the syllabus was exactly the same.\nOne of my biggest qualms with the class was that Professor Vandenburg doesn't lecture a lot and instead relies on people's comments to conduct the class. This often led to a very dynamic class. However, sometimes, members of the class would feel the need to discuss the texts using Vandenburg's terms and ideas, and most of the time, they would have no idea of what they were talking about. \nSo, in conclusion, yes, you should take this class, as Professor Vandenburg is extremely smart, the texts are fantastic and the lectures/discussions are often engaging and interesting. However, realize that Professor Vandenburg's perspective is not the be all and end all of literary criticism.\nIt is perfectly possible to do well in this class. I took it as a First Year and got an A, even though the only college Literature class I had took before it was LitHum.\nWorkload:\nApproximately a novel a week. 2 6-8pp papers. 1 final (easy ID's with lots of analysis and one essay question she hands out beforehand)\n"

            "review_content": "\nModernism as taught by Margaret Vandenburg has changed the way I think. For all of you who just judged my saying that, don't worry. I would judge me too, because it sounds almost absurd. I shit you not, though. This woman has a cult following for a reason. \nAlthough her perspective is specific (feminist slant, philosophically sexualized views), she by no means discourages unique interpretations of particular works. I remember many instances during the semester when students made outlandish comments only to be rejoined with an affirmative response from Margaret. Less judgmental than many of the stuffy English majors who sat around to quietly scoff at those making wet-behind-the-ears comments (I was one of the scoffers), Margaret gracefully leads the class to its sweet and rapturous end: the discovery that the genesis of opposites (the necessity for things to be either black or white) has transformed this universe into a seething vortex of annihilation. Margaret's interpretation of Modernism is more than simply a line of thinking, it's a way of reading and breathing the Modernist plight. My most private and existential thoughts have closely aligned with what I internalized from this class. I have taken three courses on Modern texts, and this one was by far the best. I think the syllabus and course discussions shed brilliant light on this era. Many folks just don't understand why she thinks the way she does, but if you understand...you'll know it; something just clicks. It's worth trying out the class to see if it \"clicks\" for you. If it does, as it did for me, you will find yourself eagerly anticipating the next class, swallowing the readings whole, and churning out some of your most productive writing ever.\nWorkload:\nTwo papers and a final.

Also, she went on at length about outside literary/psychological texts and expected everyone to have read them--I don't understand why she didn't just assign the texts if she wanted to discuss them.  I was really disappointed, especially since I loved what we were reading and her approach prevented me from enjoying it.

It's also probably not for complete Modernism novices and English majors/GS students etc. who really jst need some 20th C. lit and don't like dicking around with crazy impenetrable stuff, nor for people who only like Woolf and just want an excuse to concentrate on her, nor for people with very rigid, fixed ideas about the interpretation of the readings, because all of the latter will be disappointed. Modernism is probably the most fun, thought-provoking, and amusing-anecdote-generating class I've taken, though, and its success or failure as an enjoyable experience lies as much with the professor as with the material. Margaret Vandenburg is, basically, about as colourful as a professor can get without veering into actual eccentricity. Her Well-of-Loneliness-informed novel tells a story of lesbian sexual awakening in '20s Paris expat society, and, at least if you've any familiarity with '80s feminist culture, that won't surprise you once you see her: she tends towards loose suit jackets or button-down short-sleeved shirts, and she has this pair of neat black Docs she wears often. She's extremely demonstrative in this very dry way, and tends to spend class leaning or curled around her pulpit-like podium-\ndesk.  The class seems to generally run to a few dozen in the single hottest room on either campus; the size is prohibitive to seminar-style discussion if you're one of those people who doesn't feel the need to raise their hand every time they get an epiphany or have a question, (and if those people irritate and offend your sensibilities in general, feel free to take this review with a grain of salt, or several); it's mostly La Vandenburg ranting, with interjections/digressions from students at random intervals, which is both oddly personal and yet as pulpit-y as a lecture class- a setup actually ideal for Vandenburg's purpose: to get into your head and implant her ideas about androgyny, style, and the Transcendental Signifier into your head (and if that last one isn't obvious, either rush to your academic advisor now or don't even bother looking at this class, I don't know which).\nActually, in all seriousness, for someone with such pronounced ideas about their subject matter, Vandenburg is surprisingly willing to allow one their own opinion; while she can be dismissive about questions, she often defers to a questioner's subjective interpretation; whether this has always been the case, I don't know. She even asks for feedback sometimes, and likes hearing what the class thinks of the reading, unless it's the often-true 'I don't get it'. Her Freud/Kristeva/Saussure-related babble isn't as unfounded as it seems on second glance- she cites, even- and, no matter what one thinks of its validity, it's incredibly amusing- she knows how ridiculous she sounds sometimes, but once one has gotten used to her interpretation, the reading will start to seem ridiculously obvious, too, and if you can get past the transgressive kicks of talking about penis to the really subversive fun of anticipating what she would say before she says it, you'll be made, both in enjoyment of the class and ability to use her strategies.\nI'll admit that there are a lot of things about this class that would irk me, were I of such a mindset, and that many of the reviewers aren't too far off in their negative assessments. I still wouldn't trade this one for any other for the sheer amount of really interesting ideas that've collected around some familiar texts since I've been in the class, and the sheer comedic value of it has been enough to make far more fallacy and impenetrability worthwhile for me. So, in other words, weigh this one carefully. \nWorkload:\nMostly very, very light for fast readers/those very into the subject matter, hard for slow readers, easy to skip readings (though skipping too many is inadvisable- class makes even less sense then). Intermittent bursts of frenzied, painful work that will, despite much advance warning, spring on you out of nowhere; you'll be glad of her willingness to give extensions and counsel. Two papers: one seemingly easy persuasive essay that will be graded harshly, and one enormous research essay that will instill panic in the hearts of all but history majors and senior English majors. Final exam in the form of an essay.\n"

I feel like many people who condemn Vandenburg never took the opportunity to voice their own points of view. She welcomes them, and she will not belittle anyone no matter how ridiculous their interpretation/insight happens to be. \nIf you strictly adhere to purely literal readings, you might not like her method. She tends to find an entirely new layer to the novel that most people do not see reading it once. But, that is why I loved her class. Who isn\u00c2\u2019t sick of listening to students regurgitating obvious conclusions they\u00c2\u2019ve come to after reading a novel once through while the professor nods approvingly? If you actually do the readings and go to class, I promise you will come out of most of the classes feeling like you know so much more about the novel than you did immediately after reading it.\nIf you are skeptical that there is anything worthwhile in the American literary canon, take this class. Granted, some of the early texts were tedious, i.e. Theodore Dreiser\u00c2\u2019s Sister Carrie and, at times, Edith Wharton\u00c2\u2019s House of Mirth. But, there are many more great reads than there are mediocre ones.

The second paper is an 8-10 research paper. Grading is very fair. Vandenburg cares that you are competent on the papers, but she is much more concerned that you seem engaged and interested.

That said, the class is very rewarding and she is always ALWAYS willing to meet with students outside of class (and I would recommend it to boost your class participation grade--it's always better if she knows your name--and she does try to learn everyone's name). As a survey course, I would very much recommend this class.\nWorkload:\nLots to read but only three actual grades: midterm paper (4-6 pages), term paper (10-12 pages), final (ids and an essay: What is Modernism?). And class participation is 10%.\n"

Yes, she conducts discussions along the lines of her reading of the material, but to accuse her of tyrranical teaching is beyond absurd, like I said before--hilarious. I think if there is one Professor I've had at Barnard or Columbia who had zero ego and every right to have a huge one, it is Vandenburg. That said: She will not give you an easy A.  She will treat you like a person.  She will make you want to impress her by virtue of her knowledge of and passion for English. She will not treat you differently as a human if she doesn't like your work.  A note on the class itself--these texts are heavy stuff, so really only take the class if you want to dig dig dig. And go to office hours--you won't want to leave, Vandenburg is so personable and humurous.       \nWorkload:\nOne paper and one research paper. And a final. Do the readings. \n"

I'm gonna fail!- but it was fine. Sure, there are the VERY vocal few who spout out thier extensive knowledge of other modernist works and basically anything else ever written ( Vandenburg herself cites many other books in lectures- but you don't need to have read them), but, as in any other class, just ignore these people, and you'll be fine. The material ranges from great to awful (for the non-English major. Those talkative few LOVE everything). Likewise, the class is either awfully boring if you didn't like the reading, or SO amazing if you did. I'd say all in all, this class is great. You may be subject to fits of passion/rage, but any class that is as good as the good parts of this one is well worth it.\nWorkload:\nNot bad at all.

The people who complain on and on about her \"narrow\" or \"incorrect\" beliefs regarding the modern authors and their works are a bit to sure of themselves, and their remarks don't make sense to me considering the way Vandenburg approaches teaching. Vandenburg loves it when you disagree with her, and say something intelligent to back up your own theory. She'll say, \"I think you're right...that's interesting because if you look at it that way then...\" In fact, I remember numerous occasions on which she scribbled something down as a student said it because of how interesting she thought it was. So, I don't really see how people can complain about not agreeing with her ideas...that's perfectly welcome in her class...in fact, I'd say it's rewarded. More often than not, I found myself agreeing with her, and one of her main criticisms of my work was that I was ready to move on to even more unique readings...and trust me, hers are tough enough to wrap your head around. Coming up with something completely original and completely ground-breaking to say about these authors was a bit out of my scope...though I found Vandenburg's insights fantastic. So, as for the reviewers who think they know it all, and who feel the need to tell you all that they got an \"A,\" the fact that they are grade-dropping on culpa should tell you enough about whether you want to trust their opinion of this class. \nYes, she could come down harder on certain people who continuously express their not-so-interesting ideas. I will say that. There was one person in particular in my class who spoke at least 2-3 times per class for a 4-5 minute rant that no one really wanted to hear about. But, in the end, it gives you time to reflect and think about what has already been said in discussion and what you are wondering about. \nYou'll come out of this class a better reader. Trust me. I'd never read like that before. She's incredible, truly. Yes, like any class, there are the frustrating moments. But, I measure a classes worth based on what I got out of it. And, I can't even begin to tell you HOW MUCH I got out of this class. It has been BY FAR, my most positive class experience at Columbia so far. It is what all classes should be like. \nWorkload:\nLots of reading. 1 5-6 pg. midterm that asks you to use style as a path by which to reveal something about the novel, 1 8-10 pg research paper that requires you to create a thesis about one of the novels and incorporate 2 other disciplines (i.e. history, philosophy, psych, etc.) 1 final that consists of easy passage ID's. The idea is that you use the ID as a microcosm of the novel. Therefore, there are no surprises or tricks. The class is awesome. Take it. \n"

And then I grew up, and realized, hey, we're just misreading a whole lot of critical theory and hearing Vandenburg fondly expound ad nauseum on HER very narrow view of the Moderns--\nand if you have different opinions?  Well, you're in Camp Vandenburg, so, as said in a prior review, leave original thought at the door and be prepared to listen to lots of sophomores who raise their hands REALLY high parrot back the gospel according to Professor V--not just in this class, but in ALLLLLL English classes at Barnard--\"oh, I haven't read Freud, but Vandenburg says . . .\" was actually a comment I once heard in an upper-class English SEMINAR.\nBut, digression aside, Vandenburg is dangerous because she teaches baby-\ncollege thinking, while making people think that a) they're thinking really hard and are so, so smart or b) because they have original thoughts, are thinking differently or are engaging intertextually, that they don't understand, that they don't get it.  Vandenburg subtly runs the class with an iron fist, and this shoddy thinking seems to permeate the English department at Barnard.  The class discussions are RIDICULOUS (and so regenerative--the same ubiquitous four to five people waving their hands wildly), the novels fabulous.  But, remember that the idyllic meadow of novels is filled with some poisonous snakes who will at the very least make you feel nauseous.\nBitter?  A bit.

I'd recommend taking this course as an upperclassman -- not because it is so difficult (although it is challenging) -- but because the more knowledge one has going in to her class, the more one has the potential to appreciate her ideas (or not). Her readings stray from canonical norms, so if you are not already well-versed in \"the moderns,\" you may not understand why what she's saying does in fact deviate from more traditional readings. As for these theories, she applies the same ones to everything we read, over and over. Although she says you're welcome to disagree with her on the way she sees things, good luck trying -- especially if this is your first in-depth examination of modern era lit. it seems that she wants to hear only what she thinks and not much more. \nBottom Line: Vandenburg is cool, and it's easy to see why the Barnard masses are so enamored with her. But before you sign up for her class, just know that you'll be spending a lot of your time trying to fit your thinking into her worldview, instead of expanding your own. That said, she wants to show you how these novels can change you -- and they can.

I was rarely impressed with what anybody said, and found myself wishing the whole time that Vandenburg would speak more. I always left class feeling like there was so much more to these texts than was discussed in class, where it seems like, with all the time devoted to student comments, we could only skim the surface. And the professor will often cite sources, after which she'll say \"you guys know it right?\" and honestly, I'm not sure I knew any. This makes it pretty difficult to follow, especially when you're discussing the really abstract, complex theories of Jung, among others.

Sure, she has a good sense of facilitating discussion--but too often, she lets students rattle off countless inane questions and comments.\nAn important thing to note about Vandenburg's Modernism class is that at first it sounds damn promising: she's a lively but approachable lecturer, she asks and answers questions, and she tries to bridge disciplines.  But after attending more than a few classes, you'll realize how damn reductive her whole process is.  For the most part, the class is an extensive list of buzz words bandied about in a dangerously general fashion.  The same names, sooner or later, will crop up in just about every class, as will general mention of gender, tradition, and duality.\nThat's all well and good, yes, but after a point, Vandenburg doesn't really go anywhere with them.  She makes general, digestible, and really very obvious assertions by way of grossly reductive drawings on the blackboard:  \"light\" and \"good\" go under \"presence,\" \"dark\" and \"bad\" under \"absence,\" etc.  It's sheer high school-level simplification that might prove useful were Vandenburg to use it to prove some larger point---but unfortunately, those larger points rarely come along.  Instead, you're left with a series of general ideas about the major players of High Modernism that in no way do their respective works justice and that leave you with juvenile assignments.  (For instance, paper assignments that are far too far-reaching to fit into the short page-lengths allotted to them.  Oh, and the topic for the essay on the final:  \"What is Modernism?\"  Ha.)  Not only that, but I got the distinct impression that Vandenburg -wanted- things that way.  When I went in to her office hours to discuss a possible topic I'd come up with for my research paper, she immediately discouraged me, telling me it would be too difficult and suggesting I try a safer topic.  Uh, since when are professors supposed to encourage students NOT to take intellectual risks?\nIf you want to go in-depth in Modernist novels at all and not spend an entire class period leaping from generalizing statements about a work/author (i.e., \"Woolf's writing is cubistic!  Joyce likes epiphany!\") to ineffectual nitpicking (\"look, it's another example of Eliot's obsession with tradition!\"), then Vandenburg's Modernism is not the class to take.  If you're totally new to Modernism, though, and just want a general overview, the class could be beneficial.\nWorkload:\nShort midterm paper (4-6pp), open topic.  Slightly longer (but still kinda short, 8-10pp) research paper focusing on one book and spanning three \"disciplines\" (for instance, relating some aspect of 'Dubliners' to both psychology and music).

Something I particularly liked about her is the way in which she is always supportive of a student's contribution to the discussion.  Not once throughout the semester did I see her make anyone feel at all uncomfortable or unintelligent.  Even if a student said something blatantly incorrect, she managed to manipulate it in a supportive manner to correct the statement without acknowledging the fact that they had made a mistake.

I didn't get the impression that Prof. Vandenburg expects you to know that stuff when she references it, rather she admits that it's impossible to cover all of modern literature in one class and frequently references other authors not on the syllabus as avenues for further research or reading.  Also, if you think you are an expert on modernism and modern thought, think again.  Vandenburg takes no bullshit, so if you name drop in class, make sure you know what you're talking about.  That said, she is incredibly approachable and encourages contributions from all of the class, not just the typical brown-nosers or over-enthusiasts.  (a small confession:  I am one of these people.  Among other things, Vandenburg taught me to enter into dialogue with other students in class, listen critically, and be critical of my own contributions).  Because of her frequent integration of writings from other disciplines in her lectures, both scholarly and pop cultural, I had not only an example of how to write a solid research paper, but also the beginnings of a bibliography.  \nBe prepared for some unorthodox views about literature, the classroom, and modernism, including critiques of over-simplified feminist readings of works by Hemingway and D.H. Lawrence.  Professor Vandenburg  loves the authors on the syllabus, and after her inspiring class, you will too.\nWorkload:\n1 five page close reading of a text, graded by the reader (who is a tougher grader than Vandenburg).  1 ten page research paper, graded by the Prof.  Reading comparable to other English classes\n"

            "review_content": "\nVandenburg is an incredible professor.  She is stunningly knowledgable about her subject and therefore has very definite ideas about it but she is very interested in listening to your ideas as well so it makes for a nice mix.  She is into class discussion, even in a large class like Modern Novel, and she manages it well.  There's not too much off-topic wandering in this class.  One of her favorite techniques is to answer a question with another question or say, \"Well, what do you think?\"  This means you better keep up with the reading but also ensures that classes are never dull.  Vandenburg is very theorhetical, which goes nicely with a class on modernism, but can be intimidating if you are new to the study of literature (or history).  Don't take this as a freshman or first semester sophmore unless you are a bit precocious.  \nWorkload:\nHeavy but very managable if you make the class a priority and keep up with the reading.  One 5-7 pager, an 8-10 page interdisciplinary research, and a final that looks for you to know the BIG ideas.  \n"

She completely cares, and while at first you find her insights to be overdetermined, over the course of the semester, you see that what she says about modernism is correct, interesting and true. She provides you with a lens and a languagge with which to talk about modernism in literature and in the world, and also a way to be critical of it. I love her and she has really moved me. \n"

She synthesizes psychological, historical, philosophical, and more elements with the literature at hand (EXCELLENT syllabus).  She knows how to run a class and is always willing to joke around.  Perhaps a bit too feminist for the Barnard fearful, the class is usually 90% female, but that actually makes her love the few male students more.  She will change the way you think about literature and the world.  I promise.  TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!!!!!!\nWorkload:\n2 papers (one 5-7, one 7-10), final - her reader is a bit of a hard grader\n"

From day one, Vandenburg makes sweeping statements about authors and references novels that are not on the syllabus as comparisons instead of actually explaining her ideas.  She uses the board only to scribble abstract pictures that allow her to avoid explaining herself even longer.  Don't get me wrong, students who were familiar with most of Vandenburg's references seemed to enjoy the class, but there is no room for anyone who hasn't been preparing for the class for years.\nWorkload:\nTwo papers: a short paper on style and a longer research paper, both graded by a reader who doesn't even come to lectures and a final exam.\n"

We had reading assignments due every class which I found manageable, but I found out many of my classes didn't even do them and then talked about the books like they did. Vandenburg has a dry sense of humor and takes the class seriously. I found her to be semi-intimidating because of this, but she honestly really cared about her students and scheduled many out-of-class conferences with us, and contacted me by phone several times to discuss a topic I was unclear on. She's not an easy grader by any stretch of the imagination, but I feel that my ability to read deeply into works and write strong papers greatly improved over the course of the class.\nWorkload:\nReading assignments due every class (manageable), 2 4-6 page papers and one 8-10 page one as a final.\n"
