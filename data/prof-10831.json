            "review_content": "\nThis class was frustrating in the beginning. The one-page weekly analysis papers were tedious and the topics covered in the first few weeks of the semester were kind of dry, but as the semester went on the course material got better and better. Overall, the course was interesting and worthwhile, especially because Professor Kenny is such a great professor. She is an amazing lecturer (and often very funny). Also, she almost always reviewed and outlined/diagramed the readings during class, and we usually discussed them extensively. She and the TAs were incredibly helpful at office hours too.\nI definitely recommend this class! \nWorkload:\nOne page analysis paper due every week.\nTwo 3-4 page papers (no analysis paper due those two weeks)\nMidterm, 5-7 page paper, and a final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Kenny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Defining Marriage\u00e2\u20ac\u009d seminar was one of my all-time favorite Barnard classes! The course focuses on how marriage functioned throughout U.S. history (with a lot of attention to religious history), and the readings give a fantastic overview of both. Prof Kenny is extremely nice and great at encouraging dynamic class discussions. She is also that rare balance of someone well-organized and tightly structured in terms of syllabus, assignments, leading class discussions, grading, etc. (which means you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ACTUALLY learning the material you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re supposed to be learning), who also manages to be a down-to-earth and reasonable teacher. As a bonus, I at least felt that the research paper I wrote for her class (she leads you through the process) totally taught me how to write research papers for the rest of my academic career. If you are at ALL interested in gender studies, marriage, American history, or religious history, I recommend this class and Prof Kenny as a fantastic teacher 100%!\nWorkload:\nWorkload: YES, you absolutely have to do the readings. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real class discussion and she WILL know if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, but they're worth it! There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some sort of analyses of course readings do every week, usually two pages; and a blog post due each week. There are also 2 five page papers and a 15 page research paper. The workload was more intense than any of my other courses that year, but it was a 4 point class and everything was graded fairly, so your grade will actually reflect the work you put in. (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also pretty sure that my writing in general improved through taking this class!)\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Kenny was the best seminar professor I could have asked for! She was always prepared for class, either with a brief introductory lecture to add to our discussion of the reading or with a list of questions to guide the discussion. She encouraged participation, but only directly asked you to comment if you hadn't spoken even once all class. The blogs were easy and ungraded except for participation points so don't let that discourage you from taking this class. Some of the readings were tedious (and skipped) but she's revamping the syllabus for next year anyway. Also, papers were initially daunting but she provides excellent help when you're trying to figure out a topic--go to her office hours, or even ask her after class--very friendly and approachable, and she definitely does not waste your time. She even gives you a chance to revise papers and her comments are amazingly helpful, because she doesn't force you to write HER way, yet manages to guide you toward writing a much more logical and grammatically correct paper. You will not regret taking a class with her!\nWorkload:\nReadings before every class, which greatly varied in length. Weekly blog posts. Two 4 page papers, one 6 page final paper, each with an opportunity to revise. Very manageable for a first semester student.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis was a great class, I enjoyed it for the most part. The novels read in the class were easy reads and very interesting. We did have some historical document reading requirements which were fine, except for one by which was tedious and annoying. There were weekly blogs which were easy if you did the reading, if you didn't then I'm sure you could make something up as well. The discussions in class were sometimes interesting but it all depends on the students. Professor Kenny was there to pick up the conversation if it died off. The best thing about this course besides the awesome reading list, was that Professor Kenny made herself extremely available if anyone needed any help, and was very patient. She held all her office hours but if those did not work for you, she was willing to meet almost any time possible for you. She goes through your essay in detail and helps you formulate better ideas and sentences. She also is very explanatory with essay corrections so when you get back your paper, you know why you received a particular grade. Take advantage of the office hours, she will help you write a better paper, and gives great advice!\nWorkload:\nWeekly readings that should be done and are interesting. Weekly blogs (~250 words). Three papers, that are graded based on the rough draft grade and final draft grade (medium/hard - but easier if you ask for help)\n"
