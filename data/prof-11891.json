But Allen made the course very approachable with fun assignments, easy-to-understand analysis, and very little reading. She truly cares about appreciating art and tries to instill that same attitude in her students. While she can be a little disorganized, her course was so fun to take and I felt I learned a lot.\nWorkload:\nVery little weekly reading\n1 art exhibit paper\n1 monument paper\n1 midterm\n1 final (she gives you the list of IDs ahead of time)\n"
