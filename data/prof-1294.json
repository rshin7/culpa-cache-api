The class was otherwise enjoyable though. I really liked how Derrick would make you question your assumptions, qualify your evidence on each paper.  He probably made me a better writer. In my first semester I got a B+, which disappointed me, then I got an A-, which made me happier. Too bad no one else will have him though, he moved to South africa.\nWorkload:\nquite a bit, 3 papers per semester, a midterm and a final\n"

            "review_content": "\nI came into Derrick's class fully aware of the high demands he places on his students, and I completely agree with the reviews below. After a few weeks, classes became fairly routine but comfortable: rich discussion carried by about 5 people every class (quality drops noticeably when a key member of the class is absent), with occasional writing exercises or group presentations. I will concede that he can be very intimidating; you can tell when he isn't in a pleasant mood at the very start of the seminar, and it will affect the atmosphere for the rest of the class. Nevertheless, when he is truly engaged in the discussion, he will enable you to make the connections between paragraphs and ultimately the various lit hum texts in ways that you could not previously conceive of. \nRegarding his grading, he does ask for a lot, and it's likely that your midterm/final grade will not be up to your normal standards. Nonetheless, the fact that he is willing to look over his students' drafts reveals his genuine desire to help his students succeed; take advantage of this. Though I rarely attended his office hours due to schedule conflicts, I did commit myself to narrowing a topic and sending him a draft for every paper I wrote. Another piece of advice that I discovered but can't completely confirm is that if you write on the books he enjoys, you get bonus points; this is the only way I can explain his uncharacteristically generous grading on my latter 2 papers of the spring semester.\nOf course, Derrick is headed off to South Africa next semester, so this review will probably be moot and unseen by future lit hum students. Nevertheless, it was a great pleasure being in Derrick's class, and I wish him the best in his new position at Capetown.\nWorkload:\nAll Derrick requires for every class is just to do the reading, save the occasional page on a prompt he assigns.\nGrading is 3 Essays (20% each), a moderately challenging midterm that he creates (10%), Participation (an easy 10% if you speak up in class), & a standard coursewide final (20%). Make sure you (and Derrick) are completely satisfied with your essays before hitting the submit problem, because they will determine your grade in this class.\n"

            "review_content": "\nDerrick is an incredible Lit Hum teacher. I was so worried about the Core as a first year in the college, but Derrick reminded me why I chose the school and I really appreciate that. He's very charismatic and passionate about literature, and class discussions are often both insightful and entertaining. He's a tough grader (I think most people got C's on the first draft of their first paper), but never unfair and always willing to meet with you for one or two writing meetings if you schedule in advance. \nA few things to consider -- he can be moody sometimes, especially in the winter. And if he's not satisfied with the class's analysis, he makes no show of hiding it, which can be incredibly intimidating. Sometimes it's frightening to the point where it's hard to speak up in class. Also, you can definitely tell when he does not like a text. Our classes on Montaigne, Pride and Prejudice, To the Lighthouse, and Angels in America were all fantastic, but it was quite difficult to get through Don Quixote. \nAll in all, an incredible Lit Hum experience. Most of the time, I walked out of the class feeling like I had just experienced a literary breakthrough. I tend to be silly like that, but my point still stands.\nWorkload:\nTwo papers a semester, a midterm + final, usually no homework, and (of course) lots of reading. \n"

He writes extremely in-depth comments on papers, which is both helpful and infuriating. He's also very moody and occasionally throws sulky fits.\nOn the other hand, he really does teach and force you to actually think about what you're saying. Under no circumstance can you spit out something from SparkNotes and expect to get away with it. You need to do the reading- all of it- and you need to be prepared to support and argue everything you say. \nMeet with him one-on-one whenever you can- in that setting, you realize that he's actually very funny and interesting, and genuinely wants to help you. You just have to do your part, and try not to be too intimidated. \nWorkload:\nOn par with other Lit Hum courses, except that you really have to do the readings, which can take a while. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis is a retroactive review from fall 2011\nI don't take issue with any of the reviews on this website, however I will give a significantly different view in perspective.  I did not do all of the readings and did not find myself and significantly better writer because of Derrick's teachings.  However, I found Derrick to be a very tough if demanding teacher.\nThis class will not be an easy A I will say right now.  I an no genius, but with in depth thinking and actual analysis of passages/works i ended up with a B+ average for the two semesters I had with him.  I was happy with this for the amount of work I put in, but make no mistake, Derrick will make you work and think for every point you put in so I would not recommend this class for those who just want to squeek by because a few of my friends who were in my first semester ended up sorely disappointed with their grades.\nThat being said I personally loved Derrick's teaching style and felt that even when I didn't complete the reading for the class that I got a lot out of the discussions.  He constantly directed conversations in ways that made classmates argue and protect their original views of passages or ideas that further garnered conversations about modern styles of thinking.  His focus on how we could adapt the old age of the material to the present made it possible take and interest even if you find the ancient texts outdated.\nPersonality wise Derrick is harsh and has no problems telling you that you are wrong.  I personally believe that you had better come with a thick skin to his class because if you are easily frustrated you will have a hard time.  Furthermore, Derrick is very very gay, which, while not a bad thing, flavors his opinions on certain subjects and some should be taken with a grain of salt when analyzing works critically.\nUltimately, I enjoyed my time in class with Derrick and even when i switched class times my second semester of freshman year purposefully placed myself in Derrick's class.  It is no easy grade in any way shape or form, but if you are looking for a teacher that knows what he is talking about and won't take any bullshit from hotshot wannabees then you should enjoy this class.\nWorkload:\n1 Big paper worth a good chunk of your grade, a couple smaller papers about more specific passages worth slightly less of your grade, a midterm in the same format of the final with half the works, and the final which at the time of this writing was the same as the majority of other Lit Hum finals\n"

            "review_content": "\nOh, Derrick. This class is not for the weak-hearted. Dr. Higgenbotham knows his stuff and while his demeanor can sometimes be intimidating (he made a girl cry in my class), he definitely challenges you to go above and beyond the usual discussion and analyses over a text. He greatly improved my essay writing because he tore my essays apart. Not to denigrate Derrick by reducing his attitude towards the class in one simple statement, but the man is hard to please. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be clear whom he favors in the class and whom he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not so keen on. I unfortunately had to switch sections at the semester due to a scheduling conflict and I cannot stress enough how less lenient I found Derrick to be than other teachers. While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to get away with just reading parts or summaries of the works in other classes, rest assured that Derrick will know if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done so. Derrick is sensible, however. You can take any position you wish in whatever argument, so long as you have textual evidence with which to substantiate. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as reasonable as you can hope in a professor. Finally, just a random tip that I remember from my section: never, for whatever reason, argue that Oedipus is about fate. Even if you think it so, best to keep it to yourself.\n\nWorkload:\nThe average for any LitHum class: a midterm, a final, and 2 papers, with greater weight and much higher expectations placed on the second thereof. Again, I can't stress enough how important it is to do all the reading for this section in particular.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAfter realizing that many people in the academic world are truly brilliant, but that doesn't make them good/great teachers, I am so grateful to have had Derrick for LitHum because that's exactly what he does\u00e2\u20ac\u201dteach. This was my favorite class the entire year, and I feel like I learned how to read and write again, which sounds weird until you experience it for yourself. I feel confident in my writing now in a way I wasn't before Derrick's help, and not in my style or voice of writing, but actually in my ability to produce a quality academic paper. And literature is so much more exciting and meaningful now that I feel like I understand what I'm reading, not just the plot or identification of 'literary devices,' but truly seeing a piece of work in depth. Derrick taught me all of those things more than any other class or teacher I've ever had, and especially for a class like LitHum, it's exactly what I wanted and more than I ever expected.\nHe expects a lot out of you, sometimes in a way that might not be clear or might be more than you've ever been asked of before or think you can do. But he also rewards your effort in way that makes you feel incredibly proud of your work, and you truly get the grade you earn. He's completely fair and his guidelines are very clear. If you ever have any questions about what the guidelines mean he's more than happy to answer them, and if he feels like the entire class is missing something, he often will provide examples or take time out of discussion to clarify. He's a tough grader, but he's not out to get anyone. He doesn't treat grading like a game, as is often the case among students. \nTake class seriously; show up prepared (which means reading! you really need to read the books!) and ready to work/discuss. Class is very much based on discussion, and Derrick acts more like a referee than anything. He'll pose questions or give some brief background info about a text, then it's up to the class to talk it out. And where the being a good teacher comes in is knowing how to control this atmosphere: if a conversation is getting off topic he'll put it back on track, if it's petering out he'll revive it with a new direction. He keeps his own opinions about specific texts to himself pretty much, although sometimes bias comes out, but mostly in an entertaining way and never to intimidate or stifle someone else's thoughts. He can be a little scary the first couple of classes, but I think that's mainly bc students come in scared of him, not bc he's actually scary. One class he talked about where to buy the best rainboots before beginning\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI promise he's an incredibly nice guy and friendly.\nGo to office hours (which is sometimes required for writing assignments) and talk to him about your work! His insight is helpful and he takes the time to individually asses your work term and long term. But do come prepared; if you're asking him to look at a draft, send it to him ahead of time and let him know what you want out of the critique. Go to office hours and talk about the books! Let him know what you think, if you are confused, to continue a thread of conversation that started in class. He'll take or make the time to talk to his students, and is always open to meeting outside of office hours if it's more convenient. \nJust come prepared to work if you're in Derrick's class. It'll be a fantastic experience if you're willing to put the effort into it and one that will pay off wonderfully. It's hard, but never daunting, and even though you're grades might be less than desirable in the beginning, he'll work alongside you to help you produce better work that will receive the grade it deserves.\nWorkload:\nStandard LH reading. Do it!!!!!! All of it!!!! Standard course-wide final, which you'll have a review session for and should feel very prepared for from classwork. A Midterm modeled after the final (at least in part; might be only passage analysis, might have ids and an essay). He's not a big fan of the Id's and gives partial credit. Two papers a term (5/5 or 4/10), given long in advance of the deadline and graded harshly. He might require you to submit a draft for one of them. Some in class writing and a few very simple (paragraph) homework assignments if he feels they are necessary. Come to class with discussion points ready to talk about. Do the reading! He does add Angels in America at the end of the second semester\u00e2\u20ac\u201deveryone loved it in my class.\n"

In the first class, he very proudly announced that all his Culpa reviews are true. I do not understand why no one is taking notice of this, but it is not something to be proud of when no student likes your class. \nThe worst part about this class is that he is a VERY harsh and unfair grader. It is very, very difficult to get a good grade in this class. However, Derrick is very nice as a person because he is helpful and always available when you need his help. He has office hours when you can go meet him to discuss your work, and if he is busy during these hours, he will agree to meet you at another time. In spite of this, those meetings are not very helpful. He will give you various pieces of criticism and comments that he wants you to incorporate in your papers, but when you do, and go meet him again, he will come up with various new pieces of criticisms for the same paper. In short, its very difficult to make him like your work and make him happy. You can edit your paper all you want according to his comments, but he will STILL not give you a good grade. \nMy point: Stay away from his class. It will ruin your GPA. \nWorkload:\nAverage\n"

            "review_content": "\nReading the previous reviews I was a little uneasy about the last minute change making Derrick our teacher for second semester lit hum. However, a few weeks in I realized I was in a pretty special class. Derrick is a really fantastic teacher, and I enjoyed the class more than any other I've taken thus far. He comes off a bit harsh at first, especially with grading mainly because he is a little. He expects a lot out of you, but the only reason he does is because you probably have a lot to give (unless you like to bullshit and seem smarter than you are which in that case you'll get what you deserve). He grades papers and exams pretty hard (for columbia anyway) and your going to have to work EXTREMELY hard for an A (A- is easier though). However all this hard work pays off in spades. I personally became a better writer, a better reader, and gained fantastic analytical skills.\nAs far as his teaching style goes Derrick is off the beaten path. However, I think all teachers could do to learn from his style. As said before, Derrick focuses on close reading passages A LOT. Class usually consists of maybe five minutes of discussing broader themes and previous discussions, then he moves on to discussing a close reading done on the WIKI (explained later in workload). After that class is a series of close readings and discussing their relevance to the themes and motifs of the text. This kind of close study really improved my close reading and analytic skills. In the beginning of the class I had no idea where he was getting the things he said from. They made sense after he said them but I could not understand how someone could get something so complex from one passage. By the end of the class I was able to get the same level of analysis he displayed at the beginning of the year (or at least what he expected us to get). \nOn top of this, Derrick does not teach the obvious themes and motifs of the books to death. In fact, he usually opts for the road less traveled by and finds less talked about themes to discuss. He often finds these themes in several books and strings the syllabus together in a fantastic way. His main themes of the class were things I could have never thought of on my own, but once discussed made for great fuel for discussion, papers, and overall discovery in future reading (I'm seeing relations to the syllabus in every book I read). \nThis all prepared us really well for the final. By the time the final rolled around, we had seen almost every quote ID before (in class), and had discussed 2 of the 3 long passages in class or in the WIKI. 2 of the essay questions were main themes of our class, one of which was the very off the beaten path theme. Overall if your a Barnard girl and you just wound up with Derrick for your first year teacher, your very lucky. Just get by the harshness and get ready to have a great class. JUST DO THE READING, YOUR USELESS WITHOUT IT.\nWorkload:\n2 5-page papers which is a surprisingly hard length. He's going to expect a fully fleshed out and convincing text-based argument in 5 pages, but you CAN do it. Regular reading list (really interesting choice, Angels in America, I loved it). And then there is the WIKI. the WIKI is simple. For each book he will post 2-3 passages online which we will then do a close reading of (pick one). Then we take a short phrase and write a brief analysis of the phrase, it's importance to the passage and the text, and the themes it illustrates. We then respond to one or more of our peer's postings. It's not really time consuming, pretty easy, and a great exercise. \n"

The 9 AM time can be tough, but it is definitely worth it, and if you are thinking of switching out of his class, don't do it! He truly TEACHES...he gives backgrounds of books, lets you know where they fit into the greater history of literature, and he also tells you places to focus on in the readings (which you should pay attention to, because they are helpful.) He basically makes it as easy as possible for you to see what will be on the final. Also, his first paper is graded hard but still, if you work hard you can even get a good grade on the first one. The rest of the papers seemed to be graded a little bit easier. He is a really nice guy when you get to know him and he is extremely smart and presents things in a very clear way. There is no way to make the Lit Hum course a breeze because the syllabus is rather extensive, but Derrick makes it as good as anyone can. I highly reccomend him and think he deserves every bit of credit he can get for doing a great job.

He will point out logical inconsistencies or biases in your argument, but is welcoming and respectiful of many differring points of view. He once got upset with our class, accusing us of attempting to figure out his viewpoints in our papers, and then writing them to cater to this impression because he wants students to really write what they think, and he won't mark you down if he disagrees with you. I found his grading fair, but others in the class found it hard. I suppose he is tougher than most, but if you put effort into your papers, you'll do well. He likes narrowed down, focused papers with some depth of analysis in them. (If you address the prompt from a slightly odd but interesting angle is perfectly ok)  He does a lot of close reading in class, which I found very effective. For instance, it's a smart tactic because it acknowledges that a lot of people either don't do the reading, or get behind on it (though the class will be so much more valuable personally if you do -- the lit hum readings are really really great) and then can still participate because they've just read the passage the class is discussing. \nOverall, Derrick is a smart and interesting guy, and I thoroughly enjoyed his class. \nWorkload:\n3 five-page papers, challenging but not impossible midterm, department final, which is also challenging but not impossible.\n"

He knows his stuff and you can tell that he loves what he's doing...most importantly, he can TEACH. He definitely wants you to make an effort in class, and is always approachable if you wanna talk about a paper or something. Stick with his class. Even if it's at 9 AM...I know I won't change this class next semester, even though the morning time sucks.\nWorkload:\n3 papers, the midterm was pretty easy, I thought. dunno about the final yet, the reading can get a bit much, but you end up being ahead of everyone else\n"

            "review_content": "\nIt definitely takes time for Derrick to grow on you. Initially I wasn't sure if I like him or not. He can be amusing, but I definitely think he demands more from you than your average TA. As a freshman, that can be daunting, but you learn to give him what he expects. He's tougher on your first paper, just to show you that you have to put in work to get a good grade, but effort is rewarded in his classes. Beyond that, he's a pretty interesting and opinionated guy, but if you have a differing opinion that you can back up, he'll take interest in what you have to say. A cool guy outside the classroom if you get to know him.\nWorkload:\n3 papers a semester, a medium midterm, and general final. Papers are graded quite careful, so put effort in it. You need to do the reading if you're going to participate, and he values participation a lot.\n"

            "review_content": "\nDerrick is a pretty chill dude.  He wears button down shirts open with a wife beater underneath and speaks in an accent thats just plain strange.  As a teacher however, Derrick is somewhat lacking.  His comments on assignments are only helpful if you actually approach him and review them.  Thus, he fails in imparting the key concepts they try to teach you in L and R until the very end of the semester when you kind of stumble across them and think OH, this is what he was saying.  On a positive note, his classes aren't boring- he is pretty entertaining and allows great detours and interesting conversations to ensue. The one HUGE problem with Derrick is that every L & R assignment, which, as it is is a huge annoying deal, approachs a catastrophic event because he makes you write about so much damn philosophy!  L & R is hard enough without having to worry about  how to present Nietzche's thoeries in a lucid and rheotorical (of course) way.\nWorkload:\nsame as everyone EXCEPT assignments take twice as long due to content.\n"

            "review_content": "\nA nice enough guy and very smart, but his assignments are way out of left field.  You get the idea that he's disaffected by the whole process, bored with what he's teaching and just trying to work in bizarre pieces of Western philosophy just to amuse himself.  While all of your friends are writing papers about current events, campus issues and college life, you'll be trying to dig through what some obscure philosopher wrote 300 years ago in order to try and make sense of what Mr. Higgenbotham means by his prompts...\nYou could do worse, and if you land Mr. Higgenbotham, I wouldn't suggest running to the dean to complain unless philosophy makes you pull your hair out.  Then, you'd better find another teacher.\nWorkload:\nProbably a little more than most L&R; classes if only because the assignments are so hard.\n"

            "review_content": "\nHe is a really good teacher, and tries to make class as interesting as possible, even at 9 am. The first few papers are usually graded with an iron fist, making sure you all know how pathetic your writing is, but as the course goes on the grades start getting better and better, and you can actually get a couple of A's if you put the work into it. Not as much grammar review as other LnR teachers, which can be good or bad, depending on how much you like grammar. Lots of peer editing, discussion of articles and pieces written by others, etc. Every week someone's paper is workshopped, which includes going through the paper and pointing out the strengths and weaknesses. The only bad thing about this teacher is that his paper topics can make the actual assignment harder that it actually is, and you will end up writing some abstract papers about philosophy, which can get boring after a while. \nWorkload:\n2 papers per week, about 400-600 words, then 3 longer papers around 1000 words, which you must have done research for. Standard midterm and final. \n"
