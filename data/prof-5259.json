She's always available if you have a question, and is friendly and exuberant during class. I took her class every day, first thing in the morning and she somehow managed to keep me awake. \nDefinitely one of the best professors I've ever had. She uses lots of pop-culture references and makes sure everyone is engaged.\nEasy class, and lots of fun. Definitely take Italian with Lynn. \nWorkload:\nWeekly workbook, and listening exercises. Weekly quiz (relatively easy). Easy midterm. Fair Final. \n"

Easily one of the most energetic-in-a-non-make-you-want-to-throw-up-way teachers that I've had thus far at Columbia. Plus Italian is basically Spanish which is basically English. Definitely one of your easier options. \nWorkload:\nLow-Medium. Workbook/Lab Book assignments that have an answer key if you really and truly feel like you can't get through their easiness. She also assigns 200-300 word blurbs occasionally which you can make up points on by correcting. Weekly quizzes, midterm, final but *If you have ANY questions...go up and \"ask\"* No problem.\n"
