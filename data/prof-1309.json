Great sense of humour - even at 9am - and she really knows her stuff. Workload more than manageable - a book every week or so and a take-home midterm and final. i know some people in the class felt grading on the first exam was a little harsh, but she was more that willing to meet with students to discuss how to improve and really seemed to take that improvement into consideration in the final grade. Lecture attendance is compulsory, but there were no discussion sections. \nWorkload:\nNot too bad - a book every week or so. Not easy reads, but Zebrowski goes over a lot of the important parts in class. Take home midterm and final. Fairly straightforward - choice of questions. Lecture attendance is mandatory.\n"

            "review_content": "\nGS Political Science majors are required to take this course. What you may not know is take you can also take CC to fulfill the requirement (there is an all-GS section). If I were you, I would look into and consider this option, as I wish I had taken Contemporary Civilization instead of Intro to Political Thought. However, once you have taken this course, you cannot take CC (if I understand correctly). \nWhile the lectures can be interesting, the other reviewer is fairly accurate in describing the overall arbitrary and scattered nature of the course. The material is fabulous, but, unfortunately, we never went in-depth in either class or discussion. We talked around everything (as the other reviewer states). Paper topics were strange. We were asked to boil everything down in the form of analyzing at least 3 of the thinkers in each of 2-eight page papers, where we also asked to include \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c5\u201cgoals, methods, etc\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u009d as some have mentioned in previous reviews. \nExpectations were not clearly outlined. As the papers were distributed, we were given information about what was expected, but it was still vague and ill defined. Unfortunately, I did not get much more than my own thoughts and observations out of this class. I regret taking it as I truly looked forward to insights and intellectual debate about these great thinkers. \n\nWorkload:\n2 papers: mid-term/final (45% each). Reading: Plato (Republic), Aristotle (Politics), Machiavelli (The Prince), Hobbes (Leviathan), Locke (Second Treatise), Kant (What is Enlightenment?, Idea for a Universal History, Perpetual Peace) Rousseau (The Social Contract), Marx (Communist Manifesto, German Ideology), Mill (On Liberty)\n"

            "review_content": "\nI usually never write statements about Professors at CULPA, since people tend have extremely positive or negative opinions about a professor. But this time I will have to make an exception. Zebrowski bases her grades on other aspects than the work load or your knowledge of the material. In the beginning of the semester she might seem like the easiest professor ever and you might think \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What the hell are these wimps complaining about.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Her grading seems extremely easy, since she only expects attendance (10%) and two essays (45% each). She will laugh it off as an easy A. Her lectures are interesting, to say the least. She will tell you everything you will need to know about the authors and MORE. (Favorite foods, sexual orientation, favorite color, height, weight \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6). Unfortunately, she only shallowly touches on the actual book. You might as well go to Wikipedia and just print the summary. So you might hope for the TA, who in my case was Pablo, who seemed to have been unwilling to read the material himself. You might still think \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ok, I can still do this on my own\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. So you read the books, do extensive research in Butler on the subjects, and you feel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I should be ok, since most of the class is not even doing the reading\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Then, the big day comes\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 MIDTERMS!!! And it is indeed THE BIG DAY, since the grade you will receive will turn out to be your final grade. READ CAREFULLY NOW \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Here is the midterm question: Compare and Contrast 3 Authors and everything they incorporate and their philosophies in less than 9 pages. After meeting with her, trying to get a feeling of the direction she wants us to go, I got a LOVELY answer: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153JUST START WRITING AND SEE WHERE IT TAKES YOU.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d So I did \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 many, many times. I wrote a solid, TIME CONSUMING paper. I felt confident. A week later, the big day for all of us finally arrived\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. GRADES! I like to call it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Zebrowski blood bath\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. 40% got a C or less. A couple of Bs and a couple of As. I was happy to have gotten a B-. I figured, my essay must have gone in the wrong direction, so I read four of the five A-papers, which were very similar to mine. I set up an appointment with Zebrowsky to discuss my Midterm paper. She simply stated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some people have a talent for writing papers and others just don't.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I WILL NOW REVEAL THE SECRET OF ZEBROWSKI GRADING: 100% Personal Preference. The Ass-kissers under you might now believe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I got this\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, however, being a professional myself, believe me when I tell you: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153YOU HAVE NOOOOOOOOOOO IDEA.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d You won't know whether she likes you until you receive your grade. Some of you will make the mistake of trying to write a better paper for the final, since you think you might be able to save your grade, and waste even more valuable final time on this crap. AGAIN \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6  WRONG! As she stated herself: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my experience, students tend to consistently write the same grade-level papers.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I survived with some scratches and my first B, in my Junior Year at Columbia, but many of my friends were not as lucky. If for you grades \u00e2\u20ac\u0153should not be important\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and you would like to work at Starbucks after graduation \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT A SHOT AT THE ZEBROWSKI LOTTERY. For everyone else, pick ANYTHING else \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 anything. \nWorkload:\nPersonal Liking ... Seriously\n"

            "review_content": "\nEasily the most worthwhile class I've taken at Columbia.\nAt first, the 6-8p timeslot, serious reading list, longer paper, and final threw me off thinking this class was going to be awful. It took me just a week or two to realize the opposite. Maybe it's because she's adjunct and doesn't teach many other courses or maybe it's because it's just the way she is, but Professor Zebrowski cared so much for everyone in the class (at 12 students). She realized we chose our topics for a reason and talked about how our background, current work, and future aspirations would fit in. Incredible amount of office hours (she'll meet with you whenever you want) and great responses to e-mails too. She started each class with some time to discuss research problems or questions and we spent a good deal of time in the beginning of the term going over how to do research for and write the paper (as well as prepare for the presentation). \nThe first 6 weeks or so were devoted to Bill of Rights by Akhil Reed Amar, which became a fixture in the class, and Perilous Times by Geoffrey Stone. Then we had presentations (2 per class) of about 45 min each with 15 min for questions. Prof. Z encouraged more class discussion on the books and topics than talking herself (though she always had insightful things to say) and she easily made the process more comfortable to work on, present, and write.\nThe seminar sometimes gets a bit more legal-based than political or social (and attracts many pre-law) but it didn't get too esoteric for the future non-lawyers amongst us. Absolutely take this seminar if you can fit it in and get in it!\n\nWorkload:\nA LOT (but worth it)! Topic of your choice (relating to rights) discussed the first couple weeks - with a 1-2 page proposal. ~8-12 page prospectus/outline/annotated bibliography due midterm which helped so much to plan the paper out, realize how it's important, and focus research and presentation. ~35 pg paper (flexible on length - mine was 50+ and I hadn't written anything half that length before). In-class presentation with questions on topic (can focus on thesis or general topic or cases). 2 hr final with 1 essay of a general question incorporating some of the readings (Amar, Stone) and about half of the in-class presentations (so you have to pay attention). Attendance is important and if you don't let her know, she'll track you down.\nSettle on a topic you love so you don't end up hating the work/class by the end of the term and use Prof. Z as much as possible for guidance and support.\n"

The entire class is basically geared towards the paper, much more so than any other seminar.   She's interesting and funny and not too harsh a grader..

She does little to stimulate class discussion (indeed, she often inhibits it, and essentially eliminates any chance for debate).  Her treatment of the material was generally mind-numbing with a few bright spots towards the end of the semester.  She does genuinely care for her students, and if you stick with her class you will receive a decent grade.  Honestly though, its really only worth sticking with this class if you know any cc section you take will bore you.

You have limitless freedom with respect to the subject of your paper (basically ANY leader in history who was special for some reason--HINT: don't pick a character that noone's heard of because you think it'll rivet everyone; the key is to pick someone interesting but also with enough research material on them).  Digressions aside, Prof. Zebrowski is really very mild-mannered and encouraging.

She gets angry when no one participates, which is funny because she never lets anyone speak. Zebrowski does not know how to engage her students, and has only a superficial understanding of the books. Her grading is extremely arbtirary; she writes little to no comments. And she is extremely biased by giving better grades to the people she likes. Don't be fooled, she is mild-mannered and gives off the impression that she is nice, but she is just a horrible teacher that does not grade fairly. Also, her essay topics are some of the worst I have ever been assigned. They are vague and broad and require you to cover too many questions.

CC for a lot of people, is supposed to be a class that changes the way one thinks, but this teacher just ruins it completely.\n"
