I did not get bored at all - given that it was an evening section that cut through dinner - and learned a great deal during this summer course.\nShe is very thorough in her explanations and knows a great deal about the subject. The lectures are well organized and setup in a systematic fashion. No time was wasted, other than technology issues, and even for that there were backup plans in place.\nHighly recommend.\nWorkload:\na few quizzes, occasional weekly readings, and two papers. the grading is very fair on the quizzes and the papers.\n"

            "review_content": "\nSancho is highly competent.  She knows her stuff and speaks and teaches well.  You end up covering a lot less than what the syllabus says, but you will learn a lot nonetheless.  The assigned readings are sometimes long and largely irrelevant, but there aren't many and you can get away with just skimming them.  Class discussion can be boring at times (analyzing paintings for too long...it's art hum) but is usually interesting.  Grading is quite reasonable.  A good teacher overall that I recommend.\nWorkload:\nRelatively light.  A few quizzes/small writing/reading assignments, 3 medium-length papers requiring visits to museums, straightforward midterm and non-cumulative final.\n"
