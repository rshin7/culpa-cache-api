Making no attempt to be politically correct, she frequently uses class time to tell lengthy stories from her personal life and has poor time management skills. Her senior film production seminar is a huge time commitment and offers students little but a camaraderie in their misery. \nWorkload:\nweekly posts, crewing on a short film for each member of the seminar, weekly production exercises   \n"

She praised herself on her intimate teaching methods, which in reality was a messy/awkward mix of over-sharing and prying, never in ways that seemed relevant or conducive to the learning environment. The structure of the class was all over the place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we rarely followed the syllabus and she admitted several times that she was basically making it up as we went along (often blaming our class's inexperience as the hinderance.) The workload was not bad until the end of the semester when she expected us to cast, shoot, and edit a 10-minute film in two weeks. \nUltimately, I never got the sense that she cared about the success or education of her students nearly as much as she enjoyed hearing herself speak.\n\nWorkload:\nWeekly readings and short reading responses, sporadic writing assignments, final film (10 minutes)\n"

Those who find themselves with the latter may try their best to suck up, cover up their disdain, smile a lot in class, look interested, and so on but the teacher's strong personality will ultimately render you unable to mask your dislike. and for that youll suffer consequences, be it small but obviously. \nSandra in turn, pokes fun at ALL her students equally, holds herself above others, and will probably NOT remember your name after you leave. She is brash and will say what's on her mind REGARDLESS OF ITS RELEVANCE TO THE CLASS. while she is enthusiastic she doesn't care about her students...or pretends not to, which is even more annoying. \nThis is supposed to be a very practical class.. I think? That being said, an entire semester devoted to filmmaking leaves you with little more than anything except a knowledge of finalcut, and that depends on what you decided to learn on your own. \n\nWorkload:\nOne film project per week. One 10 min final project. \n"

Some of the assignments were fun and interesting, but others were not and presented a struggle. This class is incredibly time consuming, but if you are interested in becoming a film maker, definitely take it. \nSandra is a really interesting woman. She has a great sense of humor and always has a ton of funny stories to tell. She is, however, very blunt and straight forward so it is necessary to have a thick skin upon entering her classroom. While she may tell it like it is without a filter, she truly cares about her students and her job.  \nWorkload:\nOne film project per week, which includes production and editing.\n"

The film shoot can take 5 hours and the editing process is another 5 hours. The class itself is also incredibly long. Also, there are reading responses due each week.\nThe positive is that Sandra is an easy grader and she realizes that mostly everyone in the class is a beginner. She doesn't seem to realize how much time and energy her class consumes for a student on top of all their other classes.\nShe is a really interesting person and I enjoyed her quirky sense of humor and her anecdotes. If you want to go into Film or Film Production this is probably the class for you. The talks a lot about the industry and obstacles you will face. I took this class just to fulfill my art req. - which i do not recommend doing. \nWorkload:\nSO MUCH WORK AND TIME. Film and edit a film each week plus a weekly reading response\n"

            "review_content": "\nI disagree with the reviewer who based his/her review around Sandra's being \"insufferably vain, pretentious and self-obsessed.\"  She is not any of those things, nor should a professor's personality traits factor that much into how much one learns in a class.  Sandra does talk about her work over the course of the semester, and she does criticize ours, but anything and everything she does in class is meant to help us learn what to do and what not to do, how our work is perceived by others, and what it is to be a filmmaker.\nSandra was an exceedingly dedicated instructor and mentor.  Despite her busy schedule and the fact that she commutes to the city every week, she was perfectly willing to meet before or after class to help work on projects.  In class, it is true that she could be quite critical about our work; it could be disheartening to have worked for hours upon hours on projects all week, only to be told that our methods and/or execution were way off.  But that is the best way to learn to be a competent artist and filmmaker -- I would much rather have constructive and humbling criticism than idle and undeserved praise.\nI learned so, so much in this class.  I didn't always agree with Sandra's or the class's feedback, and in those instances, was never required to follow their advice.  But every point of criticism or personal anecdote from Sandra contributed to my knowledge and experience in the field of film, to my development of a narrative voice, and most importantly, to the advancement of my own personal ideas of what should be considered good filmmaking.  I never felt \"humiliated;\" it was always okay to disagree with Sandra, as long as you approached each class with an open mind and a readiness to learn.\nSo don't take this class if you can't take criticism; don't take this class if you have staunch opinions about your work that you're not willing to reconsider for the objective of becoming a better and more informed filmmaker.  DO take this class if you are interested in filmmaking, don't know enough about it, and want to learn from an enthusiastic, honest, and dedicated professor with loads of experience, both as a professor and as an industry professional.\nWorkload:\nA 3- to 5-minute project every week, leading up to a 10-minute final project during the last month.  Occasional and very manageable reading.  As time-consuming as you want it to be -- the more you put in, the more you get out!\n"

            "review_content": "\nSandra Luckow is simply the worst professor I have ever had in my 3 years at Columbia.  While we watched a lot of interesting films in this class which did help me learn about the history and different styles of documentary filmmaking, Sandra Luckow seems to me insufferably vain, pretentious and self-obsessed.  She forced us to watch and praise all of her own work, she continually compared herself and her work to that of great filmmakers, namedropped, and even went so far as to say that Best in Show was inspired by a film on ventriloquism that she made!  She also humiliated several students for making commets she didn't deem valid.  She was also, in my opinion, a terrible lecturer, frequently merely reading extensive passages from IMDB rather than coming up with her own material that we couldn't read ourselves online.  She is an intelligent woman who I believe does know a lot about documentary filmmaking, but I really felt like her lectures were more irksome than constructive, and that most of what I learned came from my great TA (Chris Radcliffe) in discussion section.  I would not recommend this class if it is taught by her.\nWorkload:\nNot too bad.  Minimal reading.  A VERY LONG and quite extensive though fairly graded (at least by my TA) MIdterm, and an option of doing a 10 minute film or a 15 page paper for the final.  \n"

Her indepth discussion of each film within her own realm of view, however, provide too much bias for the screening of the film as well as give the students an overall air of arrogance. Her choices of film are always interesting and fresh, but at times the length of the class can be tiring, especially considering her pension for letting students out late. Overall, Luckow knows  a lot about her profession and genuinely wishes to impart this knowledge on her students. \nI would recommend the class to anyone who is willing to work, and deal with at times unbearable narcissism.\nWorkload:\nweekly film journals, ridiculously long midterm paper(15 pages), and option of making a documentary or writing another 15-page paper for the final...\n"
