She is also great at explaining complex phenomenon in ways anyone can understand. If you have her as a TA for a class, definitely go to her office hours because she will be a huge help. She is also really fun to talk to, down to earth and funny. Feel lucky if you have her as a TA!\nWorkload:\nshort, very manageable readings; heavy emphasis on information given out in lectures. \n"
