He doesn't use a textbook, he writes MATH PARAGRAPHS instead of in blocks, his method of teaching is extremely difficult to understand, and his grading methods are just ridiculous. \nWorkload:\nThe workload is one difficult homework assignment each week with no partial credit, two straightforward midterms and a HIGHLY curved final. \n"

Absurd problem sets and tests created mass confusion and a significant curve that probably saved most.  Mannerisms so bizarre you'll have to restrain yourself from laughing. And I forgot, he's 20 years old.  Get help on the homeworks and use the extra credit to get a very high HW grade and not have to worry so much about the tests (the midterm was relatively straightforward, the final was madness).  All in all- don't do it.\nWorkload:\none intense problem set per week, mid-term and final heavily curved. \n"
