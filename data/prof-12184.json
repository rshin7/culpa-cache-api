A fair amount of the grade seems to come from participation (on gu\u00c3\u00adas and in discussion). But get ahead on the class's longer papers (the first comes right before midterms); she really does give you total freedom on these, and if you think of a topic and ask her for help researching it beforehand these can be very valuable. \nWorkload:\nGu\u00c3\u00adas de Lectura (ranging between a synopsis to several pages) before each class, two larger paper/projects on a topic or your choosing, an oral presentation relating to the curriculum\n"

            "review_content": "\nNote: The specific class topic was the arts under repression during La Guerra Sucia (the dirty war) in Argentina from 1976-1983. \nThe curriculum is well laid-out, beginning with some dense history but quickly moving into the meat of the class which is reading Manuel Puig's \"El Beso de la Mujer Ara\u00c3\u00b1a,\" a fascinating novel about the friendship of two cellmates. On either end of the semester are the responses of different writers, artists, and musicians to the tyranny of the Argentinian government. We looked at art and interpreted journalism and song lyrics. \nProfesora Codebo is fantastic. She energetically facilitated discussions each class on the reading, creating an inclusive environment and managing to coax a few words out of nearly everyone. Rather than lecturing, it is the thoughts of the students with her guidance that drive the course. There are \"Gu\u00c3\u00adas de Lectura\" responses to the readings that ask you to offer your own personal interpretation and critical analysis of what you've read (specifically about El Beso). These interesting questions would be further deliberated on in class and related to the political situation in Argentina. I learned a huge amount about the time period and also the psychological effects that it had on Argentinian society, even until today. Sometimes we would spend class acting out different scenes from the book, and Codebo has a great sense of humor about everything. She is also understanding about the occasional late work if you're not doing it too often. \nOverall, highly recommended- i improved in writing and speaking and the topic is awesome. \nWorkload:\nAt the end of each class, there is a \"Gu\u00c3\u00ada de Lectura\" that you need to have done the readings to complete coherently, but isn't graded on correctness of answers. You can alter your answers in-class during the discussion of the gu\u00c3\u00ada if you wish. 2 750-word compositions, the second of which is the rough draft for the final 1500 word paper. One in-class presentation that correlates to what we've been talking about in class. All in all consistent work throughout but not too bad. \n"
