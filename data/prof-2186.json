            "review_content": "\nProfessor Timberlake is charming, as so many reviewers have already noted here, and his quirky sense of humor helped make a potentially dry topic palatable and even interesting. He might not have McWhorter's showmanship, but I looked forward to his lectures just as much. For the most part, lectures were centered around readings from a textbook by Andrew Carnie. It was refreshing to be assigned regular readings from the same textbook and not regret having purchased said text at semester's end (which is usually the case for me, because most textbooks are boring/irrelevant or rarely assigned). \nIn response to the previous reviewer, A.T. is far from inept. I found his explanations thorough and his lectures very helpful in completing the problem sets. Just because he claims that he does not understand ambiguous parts of Carnie's theory, it does not follow that \"he does not even have a handle on [...] foundational principals.\" It seemed to me he was actually pointing out minor weaknesses or inconsistencies in the Carnie chapters, only in his characteristically friendly manner. I agree that the linguistics department at Columbia is limited, but it's true weakness is its small size, not its current faculty. \nTimberlake is one of the most personable profs I've had over the past four years, and I can see him being a wonderful resource to anyone with an interest in graduate-level studies. I'd recommend this class to anyone with an interest in the topic. Skim the Carnie book and go to the first few lectures to be sure its for you. Then enjoy! \nWorkload:\nThree problem sets, one take-home final. Although you had to get yourself in a bit of a 'Timberlake state of mind' to figure out what he was really asking in certain questions, if you played along there'd always be a worthwhile insight to follow.\n"

It is already disappointing that Columbia has such a limited Linguistics program, but that Professor Timberlake is the head of the \"department\" exacerbates this disappointment even more. There is little hope for Columbia to ever be able to accommodate those who are truly interested in the field when nearly the only person who feigns teaching it does not even have a handle on its foundational principles, let alone the complex ideas that this foundation has generated and that are currently being studied by those who treat Linguistics as the rigorous science that it truly is.\nFew readings were assigned from those who developed key ideas in the field, and when these primary sources were assigned, it was obviously without any consideration as to how this -- highly complex -- material should be presented. Assignments were indecipherable -- Timberlake is notorious for this, which most people talk about as if it were a charming quality --, serving to be entirely uninstructive wastes of several hours. Assignments were hardly ever returned. One e-mail we received from Professor Timberlake read: \"Various things have conspired to keep me from finishing your earlier problem set (too much other work, avoidance,...)\"...\nWorkload:\nA few indecipherable, uninstructive \"problem sets.\" Long and similarly pointless final.\n"

At some, point, Timberlake will remember to assign you a 20-page final paper, which you will write, painfully, over the course of one weekend, and which is apparently worth your entire grade. You will get an A. You will not remember a single thing that you learned during the semester.\nWorkload:\nAlmost nonexistent.

This is one of the best classes I have ever taken.  Ever!  I came to Columbia in part because of Lit Hum, so I had very high expectations, and this class by far exceeded them!  It was the perfect combination of every aspect of a college class:  Timberlake was engaged, both with his students and the material, and absolutely brilliant; he was caring and kind and made an effort to connect to every single one of students; and he gave very little work (see Workload), and the work he did give was very well thought-out, so that one got a lot out of doing it--I learned the most in Timberlake's class by far out of all my courses, and had by far the least work.  He's very understanding and knows that you don't get around to doing all the reading--but, that said, you want to, because the class is basically just a discussion, so in addition to participation being important, you simply want to participate, because the class is so interesting and you want to impress him, and that's kind of hard to do if you haven't done the reading, of course.  The point is, don't sweat it.  He's a lenient grader on exams and papers, and is mostly looking for original or interesting ideas that are supported by the text.  Not difficult.  The ONLY downside to Timberlake's class (okay, besides the 9 am time slot--but that IS SO WORTH IT!) is that he doesn't teach the second semester.\nWorkload:\n3 papers, which he himself says are short and to the point--they really are; you have plenty of time to do them in\n1 midterm, modified from the standard Lit Hum midterm to better suit the specifics of his class\n1 final, that he writes himself\n"

Mostly Professor Timberlake rambles, and sometimes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting but usually it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not. At first I thought I could depend on the reading to get me through the course, considering the professor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficient lecture skills. But when the reading stopped relating to the homework a few weeks in, I had to rely on Wikipedia to understand the concepts and complete my homework. How sad is that? Also, the TAs were frequently a better resource than the professor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lectures. I stopped doing the reading a few weeks in, and I ultimately stopped coming to lectures unless I had to turn something in, or I would bring other work to do other while there. I found my attendance at the TAs' office hours to be much more important to my grade. Really, I would not have survived the class without Amelia and Ben. The take home final was very long and parts of it seemed impossible. Beyond that, the class was actually not too difficult. (If you met with the TAs and used Wikipedia, that is.) I think it says a lot that I rarely attended lecture but still did well in the class. \nBefore I took this class, I thought that I would pursue a concentration in Linguistics. Now I know that I do not want to study further in a concentration that is directed by this professor, but I am frustrated because I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if I would actually be interested in the subject under different circumstances. I cannot tell if I would actually appreciate linguistics if I had received more relevant and engaging instruction. \nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets, based on weekly reading assignments (which are useless, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do them). No midterm. Take-home final that is possibly as long as all the previous assignments combined, and far more difficult.

Every single email and homework assignment had a typo, and in linguistics this is actually a big deal. We had a take-home final and every single day until the day before it was due he sent out corrections that students had caught. It was ridiculous. Totally ridiculous. HOWEVER. Although Alan was somewhat exasperating, he was also really into linguistics and knows so much that it slightly makes up for all the shortcomings.

Since Timberlake failed to reinforce sometimes painfully complex concepts, the homework was at times nightmarish and parts of the final were like trying to solve a riddle. Though Timberlake is a nice and approachable person, he was somewhat inaccessible. Furthermore dealing with his unsympathetic and confusing TA only left me with more questions.\n  Also note that the homeworks were mysteriously graded by someone other than the TA who still remains anonymous to me. There were no corrective comments and no resource for feedback since I presume the TA did not see the students' work. By the time the final rolled around I had amassed a large number of unanswered questions pertaining to the subject matter. \n  Lastly, though at times I found this subject matter to be very interesting, it is not what one might expect from linguistics. If you are only interested in language in social contexts and aren't particuarly fascinated by sentence diagramming or phonological or morphological structures, this may not be the class for you. Timberlake should be praised for his playful attitude and boundless knowledge of lingustics but sadly this class would need to be far more organized and clear for me to recommend it to anyone.  \nWorkload:\nA medium amount of work.
