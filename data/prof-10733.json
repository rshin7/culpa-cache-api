He lectured very little, instead allowing class discussion to determine almost entirely what got discussed.  He was incredibly generous in allowing us to write rough drafts of all papers; the final also was very fair - he gave us a list of themes and pulled entirely from these in choosing essay questions and passage ids.\nIf you want a CC class that is fairly relaxed, take Professor Bronson's - enjoyable and hardly painful, though definitely not the hardest of the bunch.\nWorkload:\nNormal CC - 2/3 papers per semester, one final, one midterm.\n"
