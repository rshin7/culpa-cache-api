Attendance is crucial to learning, as is studying every day (vocab). He has a sense of humor about everything, which helps the tired way in which Viola! presents French. This was my only Friday class and I always went. Professor Holmes is pretty accommodating with conflicts, and will allow you to go other sections to make up the work. As far as the difficulty of tests and quizzes, they're pretty standard though he does tend to put more vocabulary on it then you'll expect.\nOne criticism, he's not well acquainted with the syllabus. \nWorkload:\n-Quizzes on every chapter.\n-Tests on every 3 chapters.\n-Writing assignments.\n-Workbook work that is gone over in class, checked sparingly during tests.\n-Midterm, with written portion and partnered speaking.\n-In front of class presentation.\n-Final, which is rather difficult.\n"
