Although I had previous musical background, I can honestly say that he was the best teacher I had so far at Columbia and that I learned so much more than before I took his class.  It was one of the few classes I enjoyed going to.  All his notes are online, there weren't any quizzes, except a few \"pop\" quizzes that he announced because he wanted his class to read, and the final was a 30 min. one-on-one discussion about a song.  He's not a harsh grader, he's easy, just learn the jist of the notes.  I downloaded all the music from his website, and the book was cheaper than most music hum classes.   This is the best class ever, if u get him, you'll be fine in his class!\nWorkload:\n2 concert reports for 5% each, a midterm 20%, final 30%, a compare/contrast paper (more harshly graded) for 20%, and individual presentations 10%(where u can present original work or info on songs), class participation 10%\n"

As a person of no musical background, I can honestly say I learned from his teaching.  He is very passionate about music and successfully conveys this enthusiasm to his students.  I would recommend this class.\nWorkload:\nTwo concert reports (easy; 3-4 pages); One compare contrast paper (5-6 pages; graded more harshly); Midterm; Presentation of a piece for the final.\n"
