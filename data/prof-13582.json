She also gives very helpful feedback on your formal drafts.  If you put a lot of effort into your formal drafts and then genuinely address her comments (she leaves really amazing comments), you will end up writing great essays and at least get an A- in the class.\nWorkload:\nThe regular UW workload and grading breakdown.  If you show that you care about the course and try hard, she will bump you up a third of a letter grade at the end of the class.\n"

However, after attending office hours, I was able to clear everything up. Although she was not the easiest grader ever, you can definitely do well in the class if you put in the work and go to office hours. \nWorkload:\nsame as any other UWriting \n"
