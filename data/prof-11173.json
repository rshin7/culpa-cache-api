            "review_content": "\nI would like to register my deep satisfaction with this course. Sure, the 3-cornered hats were a little silly, but keep in mind that this is an UNDERWATER BASKETWEAVING COURSE. It is a rigorous field and even its most dedicated and able students sometimes need a reprieve from the poignant and scintillating course matter. The films were insightful and the discussions were pleasureable. I personally thought that the plumed hats and whalebone hoop skirts in the film \"Lonley Laurie Crosses the Prairie\" were a brilliant homage to the \"au naturel\" trend in pre-federal American pornography. And I particularly enjoyed the course's section on Benjamin Franklin, a pioneer in the field -- and a fox in a frock coate! I would recommend this course.\nA word to the wise: if you are not comfortable hunting and skinning your own rabbit for the \"hands-on\" field trip requirement, you may want to sign up for something else. Latex is a no-no in the reenactment workshop.\nAnother side-note: you may need to schedule an hour at the gym every week to work out your other arm.\nWorkload:\nUsing the hand crank to keep the films going can get pretty exhausting so get your friends to sign up and take turns.\n"
