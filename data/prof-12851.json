He is more than willing to meet with students outside of class, and genuinely wants his students to learn. I have taken Hebrew with him for years. He fosters a sense of community and camaraderie while still maintaining control over the class. It is truly a pleasure to take Hebrew with Illan (both 1st Year and 2nd Year). He is committed and intelligent and has been one of the best professors I've had here.\nWorkload:\nManageable but consistent \n"
