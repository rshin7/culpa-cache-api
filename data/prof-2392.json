My attention was rapt for one whole semester--so much so that I often found myself neglecting my other classes.  However, any extra effort put into this class is certain to payoff in one way or another and like any other class, the effort that you put into it is really what  makes the difference between a class of pure ecstasy and one of intolerable disappointment.   Overall I highly recommend this class for all interested parties.  The many of rotating professors were well versed and very insightful.  Others seemed somewhat clumsy and bumbled through the lesson.  Hit or miss I guess.\nWorkload:\nMost of the subjects were small and narrow in scope.  But watch out, there are a few things we touched upon that were so profound that it was nearly unbearable.\n"
