            "review_content": "\nGreat Professor.  Fair teacher who is genuinely concerned with teaching material.  SHe really wants you to be as excited as she is about the subject.  Unfortunately this is fliud mechanics, but she tries hard.  She brings in demonstrations, shows videos.  She also really seems to understand the student.  Students can show up late or not at all with no angry glares or remarks.  She posts everything online if you miss a day.  She even brought cookies to the first lab.  \nThere are only 6 labs, about an hour each.  They actually work and are relevant, unlike the physics labs.  The write ups aren't bad at all since you work in groups and can divide up the work.  Homework is due every other week.  The midterm is a piece of cake. She refers to it as a quiz and really should be thought of as such.  Something like 6 problems taken directly from the 3 homework assignments.\nShe is also the fairest grader I've had.  THERE IS NO CURVE in this class.  However, the assignments are such that and A is very possible, even an A+ if you're dedicated.  It's very much like high school.  Very satisfying when most classes have made up curves graded around god knows what.  THe final is much tougher, but doable.  Enjoy this professor because she is quite good.\nWorkload:\nbiweekly HW (every other week, 6 total), biweekly labs (6 total), Simple group presentation. One ridiculously easy midterm and moderate Final.\n"
