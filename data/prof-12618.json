            "review_content": "\nI had David J. Kim for \"Magic, Witchcraft, & Modernity\" spring semester of 2013.\nThere were certainly a few people interested in the class, but they were few and far between. Primarily, the class was filled with individuals on facebooking that showed up to class solely because attendance was taken and part of the grade (15%).\nHe is a dry and his lectures are full of academic masturbation - my least favorite thing. He shows a fair share of movies (good thing) but really just mainly talks incessantly (bad thing). Mainly, I feel as though he teaches the class to share what he considers to be his \"great ideas\" to some young minds. As I said, its academic masturbation.\n\"I do not like david j kim.\nI do not like him in any style.\nI will not take him fried or boiled.\nI will not take him poached or broiled.\nI will not take him soft or scrambled,\nDespite an argument well-rambled.\nNo fan I am of the kim at hand.\nDestroy that prof! Today! Today!\nToday I say!\nWithout delay!\" - Adaptation of \"Green Eggs and Ham\"\nNo, but in all seriousness, do not take this class. It is boring and a waste of your time.\nWorkload:\nTwo essays (super tough grading and each worth 30%) and a final take-home written assignment (worth 25%).\n15% attendence\nHeavy reading (also relatively dense, depending on the week) but its really unnecessary to do any until it comes time for paper writing. (But some of it is really interesting, at least).\n"
