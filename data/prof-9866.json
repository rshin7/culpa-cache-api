The shorts answers are a pain and you have to memorize definitions. The book is pretty good so I stopped going to class and ended up doing well but I had taken statistics in high school. Some people in the class definitely struggled. She is not an engaging lecturer. Basically each class consists of her going through a powerpoint and asking some conceptual questions. The homework takes more time than necessary and it takes forever for you to get it back. This might work for people who want more memorization and less math but I just found it to be annoying.\nWorkload:\n3 tests - 30% each. 10% homework. There are more homeworks than you have to complete. Recitation isnt mandatory but when you do an SPSS experiment then that counts as 1 extra credit point on your next test.\n"
