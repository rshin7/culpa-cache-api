She is also fun and lively almost every day (everyone has slow days, but I never remember Ana being negative or unfair).  As another reviewer said, she is very lenient with late work, and I don't think she assigns much at all.  She'll love you as long as you put in some energy. I learned a lot and think she is a great asset to the Spanish department.  \nWorkload:\nLight, and deadlines are lenient.  Departmental midterms and finals. \n"

I would recommend her, as she can be there for you and she really goes through all the grammar. She is also lenient on a late assignment or a missed class.  \nWorkload:\nmedium homework, etc, all the same as for any other spanish class\n"
