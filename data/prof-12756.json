She also tried to organize loads of events for us so that we could do things as a class outside of class time (see a movie, play, etc.). They were all very unique and not for everyone, but she definitely went out of her way to do that.\nWorkload:\nNot too tough. Weekly Vocab/Grammar quizzes. 3 tests and a final, none of which are graded very harshly. You have to do a lot of vocab studying on your own, though.\n"
