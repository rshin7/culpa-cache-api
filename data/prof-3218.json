His class is  stress-free, which enabled me to actually learn the material.  I also did not feel self conscious in this class, which I did in intro to ET.  Most students did very well, even those of us who are not singers, or good at rhythmic dictation. In all, I enjoyed my time with Fancisco.  \n\nWorkload:\nNot to bad\n"
