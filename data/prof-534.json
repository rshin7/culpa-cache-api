Unfortunately, if you do the reading the class can be boring because she basically restates what you've already learned.  And there really are too many things to read; not all of them are worth it.  No class discussions.  But the professor is a very kind and helpful lady.  She really puts her heart into this class\nWorkload:\nTons of reading (not necessary to read it all) a research paper, midterm, and final\n"

Unfortunately, she has managed to select the longest and most tedious readings possible, peppering the class with her incomprehensible commentary (speaks Spanish with a perfect American accent, won't allow a word of English spoken), and an obscene number of irrelevant handouts. If you do 25% of the reading, you'll be the most prepared one in the class. It's a required course for Spanish majors, so kiss up a little bit, try to stay awake in class, and you'll do fine.\nWorkload:\n4-6 papers (3-5 pages, reasonably graded), midterm and final. If you get a B- or worse, she'll let you rewrite it (midterm included).\n"
