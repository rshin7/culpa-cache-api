You don't have to go to lectures though and as long as you submit the weekly problem sets and turn up for the midterms and final you'll be fine. Rumen is actually a very nice guy and holds frequent office hours during which he gives you all the extra help you need. Go to his review classes because he covers all the topics you need to know for the upcoming midterm/final and often gives hints about what not to study.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem set (lowest 2 grades dropped), 2 midterms, final. \n"

He has a thick accent, but he is understandable, which is more than can be said about the majority of the Math department. He responds quickly to emails, gives credit for problem sets even when they are late, and is a fair grader. He has office hours frequently, more around exam time. He curves pretty generously at the end of the semester (not for individual tests). He's not spectacular in his teaching abilities, but you have to essentially teach yourself Calculus anyway. All in all, a good guy. Plus, he gave out candy during the final. \nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets (drops the two lowest grades), 2 midterms, final\n"
