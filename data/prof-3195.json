Her classes are very lively and although the workload for this course can be a little exhausting, she will guide you through it step by step. I was a good writer when I came to Columbia, I am now a much, much better writer. \nThe major pro with Erika is that she's very much in touch with the student's perspctive because although she's been teaching for a while, she is still a student (PhD). Her general knowledge and research experience in a broad range of topics means she is incredibly helpful in guiding ones research by suggesting avenues of exploration one probably wouldn't have gone down otherwise.\n"
