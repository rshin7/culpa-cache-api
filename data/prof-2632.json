He recently addressed the MSTU4000 seminar, which introduces students to TC's illustrious faculty members' work.  \nTaylor's rambling talk made no point whatsoever.  \nI have not taken an entire semester-long course with him so I speculate that it would be an excruciating three-month-\nlong narrative about drawings he's made of people around the world, stories about early aviation, and an occasional song sung in a rather pleasant basso voice.\nWorkload:\nn/a\n"
