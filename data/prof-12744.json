He has trouble sticking to a syllabus and time management. He is a rough grader (no one in our class has gotten above a B+) and his criticisms/comments are often fuzzy or contradictory. One time this semester he canceled office hours for that week and made them for 2 hours after he sent out the email. He's a sweet guy but is late with deadlines and returning assignments which often hurt us.\nWorkload:\nStandard UW, except the readings were MUCH longer than standard UW classes (average of 2 30+ page readings between classes plus extensive writing) \n"
