Not only is he hard to understand (and get confused when students ask questions), the things he teaches is seem to pop out of nowhere... All of a sudden you'd see all these variables on the board and you have no clue what they are and what they do. Most of the information are in the lab manuals, and reading through that gives you all that you need to know for the course. There's no midterm and no final, just lab reports every week. Just get to know your TA cuz everything goes through TAs, including grading, attendance, participation, etc.. \nWorkload:\nPretty light: weekly lab reports, no midterm, no final.\n"
