Professor MacAdam is incredibly erudite and has a very sarcastic whit.  His lectures are informative but I feel like he spends too much time summing up the plots of the novellas.  If you haven't read the words, then it's helpful but its repetitive if you have.  \nWorkload:\nYou read about one to two 50-200 page novellas a week with four midterm papers and four final papers.  \n"

He will talk to you about whatever and will put in a lot of time to help you figure out your point of view on the book.\nHe is really accessible outside of class.\nOn the course itself:\nFirst part is mighty boring. But after your first set of essays you start getting why did you have to read all the boring ancient stuff. As you progress through the course, you see why each book was included. Bottom line, each previous book helps you read the next one.\nI thought the course was very well made: I enjoyed it far better than another survey lit course I've taken.\nProfessor MacAdam oftentimes made the entire class laugh to tears. I promise, you will be falling asleep listening about distant pasts of obscure people, and then you will find yourself falling off the chair, laughing. \nOne of the most memorable instances was when we were reading Goethe, I believe. Professor MacAdam stood before class, explaining why did he choose that specific translation of the book. \"My close friend translated it. Yeah, we're very close. In fact, I think of him every_day! *long pause, looking at the back wall over our heads* Because I have his sofa in my living room!\"\nWorkload:\nLots of reading. Some people got B+'s on their essays using just their lecture notes. Two sets of essays: 5 and 4. I found final ones to be really complicated. But I'm a math major, what do I know.\n"

Many on here have talked about how much they love him, but some believe he's just a pervy old man with dry lectures. This is not true! He DOES want his students to participate- he would always ask our class like 3 times over the course of the hour & 15 minutes if they had any questions or wanted to contribute something...and no one ever said anything. This genuinely disheartened him. I remember going to office hours one day and he expressed his disappointment that no one seemed to want to have any discussion...so if you feel as if he's just talking at you about the books, remember that he will ALWAYS welcome questions, comments, connections, or anything. He is so, so, SO knowledgable about pretty much every piece of literature to ever be written, in like every language...so make use of his brilliance! Engage in some debate! He really cares about his students and enjoys teaching them.\nAnd he is not a pervert. The class is literally about love and sex in literature; how can you not expect him to NOT talk about how the characters are gettin' it on?\nI recommend taking any class this man teaches. You will learn a ton, and I guarantee you will enjoy his sarcastic, deadpan sense of humor. Come to him with any issue (or even just to talk) and he'll be your best friend.\nWorkload:\nThe readings are so, so good. Bunch of Ovid and Plato, Nabokov, Shakespeare, Goethe, Mann, etc etc. About a book a week. A midterm of 4-5 600 word essays on books from the first half of the semester, and a final of (again) 4-5 600 word essays on the books from the second half of the semester. Incredibly manageable...come on, the only assignments besides reading are some mini-essays.\n"

I love Euripides, Shakespeare, and Nabokov, however MacAdam's would have ruined them for me had I not already found my passion for them. Class is boring and feels like you don't need to go, which many people in fact, don't actually attend. He summarizes the texts and then adds his own personal opinons. He says funny, quippy things every now and then, but he never provided analyse for the books, only his opinions. Writing essays for this class, which is the final and midterm, became difficult because I have little to say. His topics for essays are terrible, and he has a weird writing requirement. \nBottom line, this course sounds cool. But MacAdams completely ruins it.\nWorkload:\nReading is doable.

Sheer brilliance.\nOK - granted, Professor MacAdam isn't too big on the concept of discussion (No offense, that's probably for many a good reason...\"How do you spell 'Kant'?...oy) AJMA is a true scholar of the humanities -- despite specializing in Hispanic Literatures, and translating many novels published during the \"Boom era,\" through taking both of his courses in English (CompLit) and Spanish (Literatura del cono de sur), it has become more than obvious that this man has acquired an inordinate amount of knowledge to share over the course of his career in academe (and yes, I just used the word 'academe'). From 19th century gardening practices in England to the details about Lugones life in the pampas, the scope and depth with which Prof MacAdam shares his knowledge with his students is truly EXTRAORDINARY. \nThe man is virtually a walking encyclopedia. But a really sweet encyclopedia at that! Go to his office hours--email drafts of your essays--complain about Barnard/Columbia--WHATEVER--he is one, if not THE, sweetest person I have ever had the privilege of meeting at this university, and can attest that he will go to great lengths to help his students excel -- from coursework to beyond. He is an extraordinary man, and I encourage anyone (with patience) to take a course with him.\nAnd in all fairness about the discussion comment below regarding the Novella Class...I don't exactly know how one is supposed to conduct a class-discussion in a course that has over 30 registered students. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that seems difficult/pointless?\nMacAdam is, quite simply, magic.\nWorkload:\nRead. Read. Read. Maybe? \nHe shares a lot of great quotes that sum up the major points of the text.\n500-600 word essays (4x) for midterm and final. Not an easy \"A,\" but a very generous and understanding professor when it comes to deadlines and extensions. It's worth ruining the 4.0, if you're worried about that.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI don't completely agree with the previous review of this course, nor do I completely disagree either. Prof. MacAdam is clearly an extremely well-versed literary scholar, and it's downright fascinating to see how he fluidly analyzes every aspect of each novella, linking the prose and their authors to other literary forms, art, history, and social understandings. The fact of the matter is that you never get the impression that this guy is BSing you--even if you can't see the connection he's making, you don't doubt that it's there. Or at least I certainly didn't.\nOn the other hand, this is the first (and looking at my prospective schedule, most likely my last) English class of any sort that I've taken here, and I choose the class looking to get a bit of a break in between all of the sociology and urban studies and general \"fact-iness\" that I've been subjecting myself to recently. I was looking forward to an English class more reminiscent of those in my prep school days, where we sat around the Harkness table and discussed our thoughts and interpretations. Indeed, I couldn't really see how lecturing could really be an effective method for teaching literature at all (it certainly wasn't in the case of CC professor...); and at any rate, I figured that with it being a Comp. Lit. class at Barnard, there would be a lot of room for the individual interpretation and expression and empowering discussion and all that other crap they do over there. Boy, was I wrong! \nFrom the moment class begins to the moment it ends, he is talking--and a lot of it is not that easy to understand. He intertwines interpretation of the text with A LOT of other things, and I'm often bewildered by what he talking about it. He doesn't have the most exciting voice in the world and isn't talking about the most exciting stuff in the world, so it's very easy to lose focus or get bored; plus he's an old timer and there a few old timer auditers or GS students in the class as well, accentuating the general aura of boringness. At least he's funny sometimes.\nNevertheless, he never seems egotistical or that he just likes the sound of his own voice, and I leave every class feeling like I just got to experience what a gifted literary scholar's stream of consciousness might just be like; and it always does come full circle, which is also cool. The man is a genius, that much is clear--even if what he's saying often isn't. \nBut if you think you're gonna get to tell everyone how YOU feel about the texts, you've got another thing coming; he has a clear objective--to expose how each text, the nature/structure of the novella itself, and the world around us--reflect upon each other (hello, the dept. is called \"Comp. Lit. AND Society for a reason!). The opinions and interpretations of a few unversed and barely-studied undergrads are of no use here.\n\nWorkload:\n1 novella each week, hitting on major names like Cervantes, James, Kafka, Melville, Joyce, etc. - not too bad\nA set of midterm essays, and a set of final take home essays, 550-600 words--and I must admit that I simply don't understand how he can expect you to provide a coherent analysis of each work with only 1.5 pgs double-spaced to work with. \nHe has a set of notes for each work, which are of absolutely no help to anyone who doesn't already have a Ph.D. in Literature\n"

Though he always asked if there were \"any questions?\" the manner in which he did so made me feel as if my comments or thoughts weren't really welcome. What's more, he never really asked questions or encouraged discussion or participation-- this is the first time I've taken a literature course where this was the case, and it felt really unsatisfying. His lectures consisted mostly of Professor MacAdam standing and reading from his paper, which I found not to be particularly engaging, and always seemed to give me the impression that he was deigning to share his knowledge with us, rather than engaging with us as members of the same academic or intellectual community. \nBasically, if you want to sit passively and listen to a professor reading and doing his own egotistical thing for a semester, go for it, but if If you're a student who likes actually thinking about and discussing the texts, this is not the class for you. \nWorkload:\nNovella per week, usually manageable.

He seems to be an absolute authority on anything ever published in Spanish and can (and does) outline the entire life of many authors we studied. He loves to lecture and doesn't really make a lot of room for discussion (but maybe that's good, since we as students know so little comparitively). The haters in the class pegged him as egoistic, but he's just really well-\nstudied. In any case, he's got the creditials to back himself up - translating shitloads of stuff (just try him on google or amazon) and got his doctorate from princeton. \nI'd recommend taking his class when you can afford to do the reading (lots) and go to his classes.

The books assigned are all wonderful, yes, but the subject matter of lectures usually consists merely of summation and comparison to other books that you've never heard of. Although MacAdam is a wonderful guy, his lectures don't address many topics of interest, such as the deeper levels of the literature you read. \nUsually, he begins by addressing the author's personal history -- not so much the social/political background of their works but rather their path to becoming a writer. Then he summarizes the book part by part and moves on to the next book. He'll usually also tell you what authors and books served as inspiration for the writing of that book, and mention them here and there. All in all, lectures become pretty useless. This isn't all bad -- you don't ever have to go to class -- which is great if that's your style, and believe me, it has massive perks! But if you're looking to get real deep revelations about these great pieces of literature, you won't. \nWorkload:\nLots of reading, but it's mostly really good stuff and quick/easy to read. No attendance requirement. Midsemester essays -- one on each book read up to that point, 600 words a piece. Final essays -- 5 out of 9 texts read must be covered, 500 words each.

If you are interested in Latin American history, culture, or literature, especially between 1962-1970 (Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Carlos Fuentes and Manuel Puig are some authors from this time), then Mac Adam is the man, and the Boom is the class. \nEvery day I went to class I learned more, just by sitting there, than I knew there was to know. His ways of reading the books are nuanced and insightful. There is very little to no discussion, but he analyzes the books for you. This isn't to say you don't have to do anything -- you have to try and understand what he's saying. Every once in awhile he'll throw in something nonchalantly like, \"One time, when Manuel Puig and I were walking down the street in Buenos Aires...\"   ...excuse me?! Not all of us are used to walking down the street with famous authors! But that's what makes it cool. His sense of humor is great, if a tiny bit old-school (as in maybe only 99% PC)  -- but again that's what made the class fun. \nI've read on CULPA that some people comprise their summer reading lists based on the works he references in class. I'm not surprised. If you're the type that's intimidated by not having read or by not knowing about every little reference a professor makes, this isn't the class for you. But if you can swallow your pride and admit you don't know everything in the world, you can learn a lot. \nWe read six authors and seven books. With the exception of two 100-page books by the same author, most books were in the 300+ page range. You don't have to read all the books to do well in the class. He summarizes every book and points you to important passages and recurrent themes. There is a lot of reading if you do all of it. But the books that I finished reading have become some of my favorite books of all time. \nMac Adam\u00c2\u2019s midterm and final essays are some of the most enjoyable and the most difficult essays I\u00c2\u2019ve ever had to write. He is completely flexible about deadlines and extensions for the midterm. It\u00c2\u2019s refreshing \u00c2\u2013 he truly would rather have you write a good essay that\u00c2\u2019s a little late than have you turn in a crappy one just for the sake of some random due-date. \nThe midterm: three 600-word essays, one on each book we\u00c2\u2019d read. The final: three 600-word essays, we could pick which three of the four authors we wanted to write on. The 600-word word limit is great because it means you cut the junk. He doesn\u00c2\u2019t want to read ten pages of bull, and god knows we don\u00c2\u2019t want to write it. He wants you to get in, make your point, and get out. The end. The downside is that the questions appeared incomprehensible at first. I had to spend a week just reading them over and over before I began understood them. Once I did, they were doable because they related to the things he discussed in class. He was happy to meet with students to discuss the essays and he was also happy to take email questions. \nGreat class, great prof. Class is taught in English. Books are read and written on in English. Can read and write in Spanish for departmental credit.  \n"

Furthermore, he not only lectures from his notes, but he stands there and more or less reads a paper-- notes  that are structured to be an article and not a class lecture.

MacAdam is funny as hell (sometimes a little on the sleazy side), so his classes are often entertaining. Unfortunately, he spends a little too much time giving summaries of the texts (which can be great if you're not into actually doing the reading).

Still, you'll learn some interesting tidbits and when he does get around to the text he usually has pretty great things to say. Also, contrary to some other reviews, you are always free to speak and Mac Adam encourages discussion, although this class was pretty quiet. Not the most exciting class, but definitely worth taking.\nWorkload:\nA (great) book a week - novels, poetry and an essay. 4 short midterm essays and option of 5 short essays or a research paper and end of semester (in Spanish).

            "review_content": "\nMac Adam is very nice, and it is clear that he cares about his students.  And he is certainly very smart.  At its best, his discussion of Borges's short stories is nothing less than brilliant.  He does a good job with Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude and Machado de Assis's The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas as well.  After such a wonderful start, however, the course plummets.  I found the readings, which in other reviews have been described as so enjoyable, to be consistently embarrassing.  Perhaps the reason reading these books \"doesn't feel like work\" is because they aren't nearly of a high enough quality to be appropriate for a college course.  Books like Vargas Llosa's Who Killed Palomino Molero?, which Mac Adam translated, were almost bad enough to turn me off to Latin American Literature altogether.  Furthermore, as the course progresses, you discover that brilliant as he may be, Mac Adam only knows one terribly unsatisfying way to teach a book: he spends the majority of the class providing you with a huge amount of mostly useless information about a writer's life (i.e. what awards he or she has won); when he finally gets to discussing the book itself, he simply moves through the text chronologically, offering a rushed summary of each chapter.\nMy advice: read One Hundred Years of Solitude, The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas, and Borges's short stories on your own.  They're all amazing books.  But stay away from this class.  It's the first course in which I've skipped over entire books--not to mention weeks of class.  I felt that doing anything more than was required would be a waste of my time.\nWorkload:\nA manageable amount of reading (a lot of novellas that you can read in one night).  Two sets (mid-semester and end-of-the-semester) of five 500 word essays on the most unimportant, uninspiring topics.  As a previous reviewer said, Mac Adam limits you to 500 words but has no problem writing questions that are over 300 words.  These essays were short enough to take no time at all, but because of the poor quality of the readings and questions I found writing them to be a terribly painstaking process.  \n"

However, the reading, if you decide to do it, is interesting and includes a good range of texts, from ridiculous avant-garde poetry to boom-era novels. And, as everyone has previously said, the reading is entirely optional. Prof MacAdam intertwines plot summary with his analysis, and his essays can be written using only passages cited in class. Basically, if you attend lecture, you can coast through the class without doing much work at all. \nWorkload:\nsame as all his other classes, apparently: take-home midterm (we got a good three weeks to work on it) and a take-home final\n"

The man gives some of the most consistently interesting lectures I've yet heard; they're thoughtful, full of detailed information well synthesized with larger ideas, prepared, and thoughtful.  What's more, MacAdam himself is discernibly interested in his subject matter, which just makes listening to his lectures even more rewarding.  The man oozes insight (and sometimes anecdotes about Fuentes as a kid).  If there were any professor who could turn a class in which he merely talks at an audience into an enlightening lesson in modern literature, it would be MacAdam.\nBeyond the lectures, MacAdam's class contains little student discussion, although he does encourage asking questions and posing ideas, and there's always a small circle of kids talking to him after class.  Definitely indulge any interest you might have in discussing the works with MacAdam further.  Not only is the reading list absolutely impeccable, but MacAdam never seems to run out of things to say about it.\nWorkload:\nSubstantial but more than manageable (and really, really enjoyable) readings that really are too good to count as work.  The midterm and final consist of a series of short essays on the books assigned.  MacAdam imposes a relieving, if also challenging, 500-word limit on essays, explaining that whereas most college classes want you to bullshit your way to ten pages, he wants as much information in as little space as possible.  Also, beyond the readings and the two exam assignments, there're no requirements for the class whatsoever.\n"

I was a little embarassed about taking my second MacAdam class, felt slightly stalkerish when I signed up for my third. But guess what? In each successive class there were other people I'd seen before, and at the end of Mad Love all the MacAdam virgins were asking what he is teaching next semester... I have no idea where people get the idea that Mac Adam has a wandering gaze, but I suppose this would insinuate that we veterans don't seem to mind. So fine. The charge is not only untrue, but irrelevant. As to the allegation that MacAdam \"may be too smart to be teaching\" , I, for one like it when my professors are smarter than I am, and can fill me in on works which inspired the authors we read (see, THAT'S what Faulkner has to do with Marquez). One of the best things to do in a MacAdam class is take down a list of works he references - my entire summer reading list is pretty much drawn from there. His lectures are fabulous, his knowledge of the material (esp. in the Latin American classes) unparalleled, and who doesn't appreciate having a professor who has translated Fuentes or written critical reviews of Cortazar? In addition, Prof. MacAdam is accessible outside of class, willing to help with essays, reading questions, or your own existentialist dilemmas. He is truly one of the most intellectual professors I've had at Columbia; I have taken away so much from his classes... The proof is in the numbers:  and every semester, the majority of his students all say the same.\nWorkload:\nReading. Sometimes a normal amount, sometimes a lot. But the books are well-chosen; the kind of thing you'd pick up yourself if they weren't assigned. (100 Years of Solitude, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Betrayed by Rita Hayworth, Death in Venice, Lolita) Midterm and Final, with a short essay (400 -600 words) on each of the works covered in that 1/2 of the class. \n"
