She gave you back full points on your homework if you came to her office hours to discuss it with her, and she didn't mind if you didn't participate one bit. She is to thank for my good grade regardless of interest in the class, and she seemed to also realize that the class was a joke.\nIn terms of Frontiers itself, don't go to lecture, it's a waste of time, and it's not actually very difficult if you download the lectures the night before the midterm/final. It's just a waste of life, basically. Have fun.\nWorkload:\nLaughable. \n"
