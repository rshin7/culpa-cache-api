            "review_content": "\nShe was a really great teacher. I absolutely hated writing because it was my worst subject. However Ashley made enduring through a class ALL about writing extremely bearable. On top of all that, she's extremely nice and funny. Each time I went to class it was never boring. She taught the class from a student perspective, realizing that we had other courses to focus on as well as this one. She was also a very fair grader. In junior high, I could never get a grade above 90 on any of my essays, however in Ashley's class I saw how my writing started to improve with her helpful comments. I ended the course with an A- (90-92) and I can honestly say that I deserved it. Whether you enjoy writing or loathe it as much as I did, I highly recommend her for this course. \nWorkload:\nThere were writing assignments due almost every class which could be kind of annoying, but it helped with the final essays that we had to write. The major assignments were four essays. Two were 1500-200 words long, one longer essay of 2500-3000 words, and a short essay of 1200-1500 words. \n"
