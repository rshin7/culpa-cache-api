He provided in-depth and helpful comments that made it easy to know where to start my editing process. He also made an effort to be available for additional help even outside his office hours. Did I mention he sometimes brings snacks to class??? All-around great guy who is both witty and hilarious. \nWorkload:\n2 shorter 3-4 page essays\n1 longer research essay final 8+ pages\nReadings every week (reasonable amount)\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Lynn (he says you can also call him Andy, though I preferred the professional title) is a wonderful teacher. He devotes a lot of care and time into reading our essays.You turn in a rough draft for each paper, and regardless of the quality of the draft, his comments are helpful and not the least bit condescending. He is a relatively fair grader, although I was disappointed with my final grade of A minus. However, he does reward improvement and hard work. His comments on the final paper are always very comprehensive and show that he took a great chunk of his day to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of your paper. \nIn terms of the way he conducts lectures, he has strengths and weaknesses. He is not at all condescending or dismissive of comments that make no sense, which shows a great deal about his character, but made students feel that it was okay to make irrelevant connections between the texts and their personal lives. At times, this prevented discussions from being as deep and analytical as I would have liked them to be. Nonetheless, the texts of the class are very engaging and interesting...if you have a good class full of women who are strong in english, it should be a great experience. \nunfortuantely, due to the long list of works on the syllabus, we did not spend as much time on certain things as I would have hoped (I don't see how a group can have a full discussion on To The Lighthouse in one seventy five minute lecture....), but Professor Lynn does his best.  \n\nWorkload:\n100ish pages per week. \n3 essays; one regular essay on one work, one essay using a lens to discuss a book from the syllabus, and one research essay.\nDrafts turned in for ungraded comments for all of them. Not bad! \n"

            "review_content": "\nI'm enthusiastic for Andrew! Enviably intelligent and impeccably witty, he does talk soft, so paying close attention is necessary if you wish to catch all of his informative and priceless LitHum \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gems.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d He is just wonderfully adorable with his giggle-ish personality, although he commands class discussions well.\nI loved his attitude during class. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put people in the spotlight to contribute during class discussions, so there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the pressure that characterizes other seminar classes. Participation during class discussion isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of your grade, which is a boost to shy people who want an effective teacher for LitHum. But survival depends on reading the material. Andrew isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concerned with whether you do or not, often encouraging people who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to admit it and move on. This attitude reduces tension during class but you really need to be personally motivated.\nThe motivation thing becomes important when the midterm looms. Half the test was passage identification, and they required some sustained thought even though I read everything. Not reading guaranteed an underwhelming grade. \nI thought he was a fair but also gentle grader. He asks for two longer essays and five shorter response papers over the semester. For the response papers, he looks for people to elaborate on localized and detailed observations in the text while he expected the longer essays to respond to broader themes. His essay prompts seem vague at first, but an early start usually delivers some good ideas to write about. For his feedback on both essays he gave recommendations for further inquiry; for the longer essays his typed responses were quite detailed and always great to read and reflect on.\n\nWorkload:\n25% 5 Response Papers due before the end of semester\n10% Midterm\n20% 1500 word essay\n25% 2000 word essay\n20% Final\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nAlthough I think the previous reviewer summed it up very nicely, I have to add my voice to the (soon-to-be, I'm sure) crowd and remark that Andrew Lynn is a really fantastic teacher as well as a pretty entertaining human being. \nAndy seems to be always utterly engaged in the subject matter at hand, whether the discussion is focused on bees, sheep, or grammatical structure in the original Latin text. There was not a single book on the syllabus that (however long it took me to get through it) I did not feel glad to have read after the hour and fifty minute class period was up.\nThe period is nicely balanced between class discussion and more lecture-type stretches, which is nice because he tends not to impose his ideas onto the discussion, but when he speaks he tends to have rather intelligent and insightful things to say. When he's in full form, he'll slip quiet little jokes into his address to the class. He doesn't seem to be looking for a response, just having fun with his place at the head of the classroom. \nThis was his first year teaching this class, which made his insight all the more impressive. At times he seemed to be discovering the text along with us, which made for a really exploratory and rewarding environment. \nI could go on for a while longer about this truly enriching class, but I'll cut it short and leave it at this: he brought us cookies twice, and, yes, he made a legitimate connection in class discussion between the Iliad and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\nSuck it, tenured professors. \nPS: Make sure to visit him during office hours. He's great to talk through papers with, and just generally super nice. \nWorkload:\nSeveral short response papers, to by done by the end of the semester. Two papers (one for the mid-term and one final) of average length for the first semester. A midterm closely resembling the generic final, both of them decently graded. For the second semester he allowed the class a chance to shape the syllabus.\nHe's a fair grader. He wants you to really think about the texts and engage in class discussions. \n"

            "review_content": "\nAndrew Lynn is a fabulous teacher.  He is always well prepared and seems to have a limitless understanding of the texts, though he is still about as young as they come for professors.  He fully utilizes class discussion, following the analytic direction of the class, rather than imposing his own opinion.  In Professor Lynn's class, teacher and pupil work together to understand the texts as peers.  Indeed, the only thing obviously differentiating him from the students is his vast knowledge and prescient didactic guidance.  Though this is my longest class, it always seems to pass by quickly due to its interactive nature.  \nWorkload:\nFine.  Lots of reading, but everyone has it.  Two papers which he gives you room to work with.  Some shorter response questions that you can turn in throughout the semester.  Midterm and final.  Grading is fair and seemed to be relatively lenient.\n"
