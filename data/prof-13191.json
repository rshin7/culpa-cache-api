But you should get ready to actually learn and try for her ALP 9 class(es). I mean her life is ALP 9 class. You can not get away from actually trying hard. No joke. She will even yell at you if you don't participate during the class discussion. If you make same grammatical error during the discussion, she will get so pissed! (Especially if that is the grammatical concept learned covered during previous classes.) There are lots of rumor about her. It seems like people either love her or hate her.\nWorkload:\nA LOT. Trust me, A LOT\n"
