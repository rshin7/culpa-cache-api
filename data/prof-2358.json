Davida (funny name) examines the material in depth and what she gets out of it, even to any strong student, is astonishing.  What you fail to elicit from the professor's lecture will be highlighted and brought to the surface by miss Brook.  Yet, she is a very tough grader as she expects from her students what she expects of herself mere perfection.  Workload isn't that tough, but Davida assigns some extra material.  Even if you don't read certain things, coming to class is far worth your valuable time\n"
