When people had questions in class about a problem, she would patiently go through it. She was also incredibly organized: HWs were posted weeks before they were due, as were practice midterms/finals and solutions. She also stuck to the book fairly well. I also dealt with a sickness over the term and she was beyond generous and kind. I frankly do not have enough good things to say about her. \nThe first midterm was quite easy because it consisted primarily of the cross product and dot product, so many people did well and stopped attending class. This led to a very low average for the second midterm. The final was about average difficulty. She has 90% problems that we've covered in class and HW, and 1 more tricky theory problem. Anything I didn't understand, I felt was my fault for not going to class/seeking out help - I really felt it was quite fair.\nShe also has an entertaining accent which I personally found amusing, but it might bother people, I don't know.\nIf you have a chance to take a calculus class with her, I would highly recommend it.\n\nWorkload:\nHW (10-15 problems) due weekly, worth 20% - lowest is dropped, 2 midterms (20% each), and a 40% final \n"

Daniela is not just a great math professor but she's also a very sweet person if you have the chance to get to know her. \nI must admit, I never planned on taking Calc 2 (especially with the horror stories I've heard from my friends) but this course turned out not to be half as bad as I thought and I'll even say ended up really enjoying the class. \nFirst of all, Daniela is very good at her job, she's a great lecturer who is able to convey the materials in a way that everyone can understand. Although she has a bit of an accent, I don't think it was a problem for anyone. She will always start the lecture saying \"any questions?\" and she'll stop periodically to take any questions or clarify anything that you don't understand. I like that she did a lot of examples during lecture however I also wished that she had done a little more on the theory and proof behind the theorems we learn because otherwise it just becomes a matter of memorizing the formula and not understanding the logic behind what they are and why they work/why we use them etc. \nAlso as a WARNING TO EVERYONE: the way that she lectures and does problems on the board makes it seems like math is very easy and this is true when you're just writing down whatever she's writing, BUT, don't not be fooled into this false sense of security because if you don't look over the problems and try to solve them yourself later you will be screwed over on the exams. And yes, her exams are brutal, but she does a review session in class before each one so be sure go over the problems she does in these sessions. She's always willing to help so if you need help go see her after class/during he office hour and if the hours doesn't work for you she also does OH by appointment. \nI want to also point out that for those who are not very mathematically inclined/are simply taking this course as a pre-req., you may fine her to be very monotonic and the lecture to be very dry. Daniela always comes in looking very tired/half dead (like all the time, sometimes I wonder if she's going to make it to the end of lecture) - DO NOT feed off this energy because it will make it very difficult for you to stay awake in class. Nonetheless, I would recommend Daniela to anyone who's thinking of taking calc 2. \nWorkload:\n- Weekly homework, around 10 questions from the textbook\n- Weekly webassign, 10-20 questions\n- 2 Midterms (Mean = 63, 54 respectively)\n- Final (long and hard)\n"

            "review_content": "\nTo those who have not yet gotten the memo: De Silva is one of the nicest and best math teachers you will have. Sometimes you have to see it to believe it. This semester was marred by the fact that De Silva was going through a brutal (her words) pregnancy, so she was always tired and sometimes would miss classes and/or office hours. Her dedication to the class despite this was truly extraordinary. \nThe class covers chapters 8-11 in Baby Rudin, including Fourier Analysis, Multivariable functions, Differential forms and Measure/Lebesgue theory. \nStrengths: The strengths of the class include Prof. De Silva's own incredibly approachable and kind personality; her dedication to the class and her students; the tests, which are very manageable (see below); and the curve, which is very generous (I got around 5 points below average on each test, got a little above 50% on the problem sets and still got a B+). \nBut the first point is really key. To give just a few examples: I had three midterms on one day so I asked De Silva if I could do hers on another day, and she agreed and even gave me the same test as the others; she almost always agreed to extensions for homework. \nWeaknesses: The one primary weakness may have to do more with the pregnancy than anything else, but the lectures themselves consisted pretty much exclusively of statements of theorems and their proofs, with little in terms of intuitive understanding and examples, though on a couple of occasions she did add a few of these. This is largely to be expected from a pure math course, but if you- like me- are still shaky regarding some of the concepts of Analysis I, you may be very lost in Analysis II. The material here is much, much harder and far less intuitive (even at the end of the semester, when I asked people \"So\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6what exactly are differential forms?\" they didn't have much to answer me). We also did not have recitations, which made the homework very difficult, though office hours were always helpful and De Silva doesn't object to you using online solutions as a last resort if needed (though these existed for only ~50% of the problems). However, all of the above is mitigated by the very generous curve, so I wouldn't worry about your grade too much unless you want straight As (or if you're very bad at memorization; see below). \nWorkload:\nTwo midterms, one final, around semi-weekly problem sets (6 total this semester).\nExams: Each exam consists of 60% memorization, i.e. 20% definitions (given in advance), 20% proofs of specific theorems (also given in advance), 20% homework problems (solutions given in advance). On one exam, an easy problem replaced the HW question. All in all, if you feel you can memorize things well, you should be able to start at 55% for each exam (assuming a ~5 point margin of error for miswriting a definition or something). If you can do around half of the doable question and steal a few points off the last, you'll do fine. If you can actually solve the doable question, you'll do great. Note: whatever you do, write everything you can possibly think up for the last two questions, including random verbal explanations and such. She's very willing to give partial credit. \nHomework: do in groups, go to office hours, look up solutions as a last resort. You should be fine, since averages will be very low.\n"

This applies to any class she is teaching.\nShe does a great job teaching the material.  The second half of Rudin is even more dense than the first, and she does a great job picking out what is important.  There were a few times this semester when she covered material differently than it was covered in Rudin, in which case she made lecture notes available online.  De Silva seems like she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s constantly looking out for questions during lecture, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also very helpful during office hours.  She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a wonderful person who really seemed to want us all to understand the material.  \nThe exams are very fair and there are no surprises.  She tells everyone exactly what to expect and posts a review sheet with all the important terms and theorems.\n\nWorkload:\n20% Homework Assignments - There were 6 of these, each consisting of 3-4 problems from Rudin.

            "review_content": "\nThis is the best possible way to learn Analysis I, especially for less intense math people, for the following reasons:\n1) De Silva is a fantastic lecturer. She always makes sure to make the material accessible to people who digest things more slowly, and moves at a very reasonable pace.\n2) She is also unbelievably nice, accessible, the kind of professor you just adore. Go to her office hours (which she'll always be happy to arrange), you'll understand. She's also very laid-back about assignments: at one point she allowed me to re-submit HW after she had explained the problems, the solutions had been posted, and weeks after the due date. She'll always respond quickly, and usually positively, to emails and requests.\n3) Put quite simply, I can hardly believe there is a more manageable way of learning Analysis. The exams are easy to do reasonably well on, even if you don't know the material all that well (see below), the HW is more than manageable, and all in all the workload is not particularly heavy. (SEE THE NOTE BELOW ABOUT HW)\nTo summarize: this is the perfect way to learn Analysis, and there is little doubt in my mind that other classes by De Silva would be similarly excellent. The one tragedy is that I hear she isn't teaching Analysis next year. \nTAKE THIS PROFESSOR IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!!!\nWorkload:\n1) Weekly Problem Sets (20% of your grade), except for the last month or so of the class that for some reason had only 2 problem sets (meaning there were a good few weeks off). Typically three problems from the book, of which two were manageable and one was hard. However, you aren't necessarily expected to do the problems yourself: there is a recitation which involves solving the problems almost fully, and she'll gladly go over them with you if you ask her. \nNOTE: While this is considered only a last resort, De Silva does not rule out using internet solutions for problems from the book (the book is an old one, so there are sites with near-full solutions to all problems). Most of the class copied straight from the web. This hurt them on the tests, but you should know that this is an option, because otherwise it could give other students an edge (my advice: try them yourself, go to recitation, and only if there are still holes left, look online). \n2) Two midterms and a final (20% each for the midterms and 40% final). EXTREMELY MANAGEABLE. By which I mean that 60% of every test is memorization (Definitions, proofs from the book and HW problems for which solutions are posted), and another 20% is \"doable\" proofs (for which you can get decent partial credit even if you know a bare minimum of the material)\n"

Why else would it be that everyone is studying the same material, yet the range of grades on the midterms is sometimes as wide as 40-100%? \nProfessor De Silva is a great teacher, but in order to do well you have to know what kind of student you are and what help you need. There's only so much so she can do in a class, and she understands that completely. She goes out of her way for office hours and one-on-ones with students... believe me, in my section there was one student who was a teacher's absolute worst nightmare, but she has the patience of a saint. \nShe lays out the techniques and teaches you ways to recognize when to apply them. There is no other way to teach Calculus II. If you do badly on tests it's not really her fault and I've never heard anybody blame her (which is rare with a bunch of smart kids). \nWorkload:\n-1 Set/Week, 10 problems usually (she may assign multiple sets per week around midterms/finals, depending on how fast your section moves)\n-2 Non-Cumulative Midterms\n-1 Cumulative Final\nGrades are curved in the end.\n"

As mentioned by other students, she prefers that you finish your problem sets and learn from them rather than turn them in incomplete.  This doesn't mean you get automatic extensions, or even easy extensions.  It means if you show up to office hours, demonstrate that you've struggled with it and get help, she might give you extra time to apply that help and figure out the set.\nOne quick note about the course:  The two major topics are integration and series.  You will learn a lot of different methods for working with both and the two major ideas in the course for each section are what the methods are and when to apply them.  It can be fairly easy to lull yourself into a false sense of security by learning the methods one chapter at a time (with the exercises for each chapter focusing on each method) without learning how to recognize what to use when.  The book has two chapters (strategy for integration and strategy for testing series) that she skipped during our term.  These chapters pretty much just go over when to use what, and more importantly, have exercises where you have to figure out which method(s) to apply.  Practicing on recognizing when to use which methods by working problems in these chapters is HIGHLY recommended as exam prep as this can be an art on its own.\nWorkload:\nVery fair.  One problem set per week.  Two midterms and a final.  No surprises, but practice figuring out which method to use without a chapter number as a cue as mentioned above.\n"
