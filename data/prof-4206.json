            "review_content": "\nBert covered almost exactly what was in the textbook in his lectures--the most useful part of the lectures was that he read the textbook much more carefully than you did, so whenever he found something he found confusing, he expanded on it.  He also decided to cover some material that wasn't in the textbook (networking), so before deciding to skip all of his lectures and just teach yourself the material from the textbook which is generally pretty possible, look at the course web page to make sure that he isn't covering something that isn't in the textbook in lecture, because it will be a pain in the ass to try to search it on the internet.  On the other hand, his slideshows are pretty complete and he posts them on the course page.\nWorkload:\n5 programming projects, from 4-5-ish hours to 10 hours, depending upon how cleverly you use the design tools they teach you, and whether you are any good at programming.  There are also written problems, which if you read the textbook are borderline trivial.  The textbook (Object-Oriented Design & Patterns by Horstmann) is pretty readable, but not strictly necessary to read that closely if you attend lectures.  It is worth your time to go to office hours, and Bert's office hours tend to be better than the TA's.\n"
