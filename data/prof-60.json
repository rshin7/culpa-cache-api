She genuinely cares about her students.  She is also alright with not covering as much material in class in order to leave ample time for questions and make sure that she thoroughly answers those questions.  CAUTION: IF YOU DO NOT ATTEND CLASS, YOU WILL NOT DO WELL.  She does not have Powerpoint slides.  Everything is done on the board.  That being said, SHE IS A FANTASTIC TEACHER.  She has taught this class for a while and has developed an organized way of presenting the material while making sure students truly understand step-by-step how to do a problem.  She won't just write a formula on the board and expect you to understand it.  She will explain conceptually why that formula makes sense, then go through a concrete example of how that formula is used.\n2.) HOMEWORKS\nThese are not terrible.  They take about 4-6 hours each.  They are very doable though given that she literally does examples that are the same as the homework in class to give you a solid foundation.  The TAs are very helpful in their recitation and are willing to help too.\n3.) MIDTERM/FINAL\nThese are extremely straightforward.  She does not try and trick you.

            "review_content": "\nThis class was one of the best classes I've taken at Columbia. It was difficult, lectures were interesting, but Davidson never expected you to figure out some theoretical part of finance by yourself. Everything in the problem sets and everything on the tests was taught in lecture, which was really awesome.\nShe went REALLY fast. Also, the classroom in NoCo that we had made it so that if you weren't sitting in the front, you were pretty much helpless to see and hear what was going on. She regularly asked the kids in the back if they could hear here, but they were all asleep anyway. \nThe TA's were okay - homeworks often had points taken off for really useless things. They were graded out of 40 and you could lose 2 points for one calculation error! \nDavidson is a great professor. She makes everything interesting and always relates the material back to something from the real world (i.e. the financial crisis) but doesn't really test you on that historical knowledge. The class is very formula/calcuation-oriented, but it's really not that difficult if you get the intuition down.\nWorkload:\n8? Problem Sets - Took about 5 hours total\nMidterm & Final very similar to problem sets\n"

            "review_content": "\nSally Davidson, is a nice and earnest individual, but whether it was her style of teaching or the nature of the material (or the combination of the two), I got very little from this class. Lectures consisted of rapidly scrawling notes on the board which consisted of formulas, calculations and seemingly disjointed examples (which, when confronted with the first problem set, you quickly realize you must copy down or be left helpless to complete the homework, which will take you 3-6 hours regardless). Class time was spent frantically trying to copy down the long numerical notation that the professor would spew, with little time for any sort of comprehensive examination or understanding of the principles behind the material. Problem sets are essentially plug and chug, tedious version of the material covered in class, which provided some practice working with the material, that is if working with the material means copying down equations from your notes. The midterm (and I imagine the final) was entirely too heavily weighted toward multiple choice which was a surprise given the computational nature of the course. The average was a 71, and the test seemed to favor tricky questions that tested the material in a way entirely different than it was presented (we were taught how to use formulas and do calculations, not how to solve trite questions where the answer was a trick.). The professor also inspired little to no interest in the field and was overall lacking in critical thinking or the encouragement thereof.\nWorkload:\nOnerous Problem Set every week (3-6 hours), Textbook readings as well (which you really should do), 1 less than satisfactory midterm, 1 final.\n"

She is extremely clear and makes and effort to make sure that people understand the material. She also tries to make class fun through discussion and a sort of \"game\" where we bought a futures contract predicting the outcome of the 2010 elections. She even came in for a long review session on Saturday before the final and stayed until well into the evening. \nThat being said, I found the course a bit too focused on the math and how to do these things, rather than on the theory of finance. I would have preferred a more theoretical approach. However, this is more of a personal thing and I imagine much of the class enjoyed the practical and calculation based approach. \nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets which took a good deal of time, reasonable midterm and final which she grades herself. \n"

            "review_content": "\nAbsolutely one of the best classes I have ever taken. Her lectures are extremely clear and never boring. She engages the class and encourages participation--which is a nice change from the typical lecture. She relates everything to current events, and gets very excited when something happens in the markets that she can talk about in class. Probably the best part about this class is that it is very practical for anyone who wants to do finance. She does not teach from a strictly theoretical standpoint, as is all too common at Columbia. Instead, she makes sure everyone has a practical understanding of the concepts that she is teaching. The problem sets do require a lot of work, but they are extremely helpful when it comes to studying for her exams. It is certainly more of a math oriented class, but none of the topics are too complicated. She provides all formulas in class and gives several examples illustrating each one. If you go to lectures and take good notes you will have no problem completing the problem sets. Her exams are very fair, which makes finals time much less stressful. She held a review for our final on a Saturday night, and did not get even remotely cranky when students who clearly had not been coming to class all semester suddenly showed up and kept asking her stupid questions. Sally really is a gem and I cannot say enough good things about her. I HIGHLY recommend this class for anyone with an interest in finance.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets which take several hours to complete, but she lets you form homework groups and each group must only hand in one homework. She does not drop any problem set grades, which was kind of a bummer. Her midterm and final both consisted of a multiple choice section which required some minor calculations, one short answer problem usually to be answered graphically, and two longer problems which are nearly identical to the problems on the problem sets. Not a class that I would take lightly, but very doable and very rewarding in the end\n"

However, you will be disappointed if you want to know in-depth valuation methods, financial statement analysis or more ibank-related subjects, take financial accounting instead.  \n\nWorkload:\nnot much aside from time-consuming weekly assignment \n"

            "review_content": "\nI disagree with the below reviewer who probably was upset that s/he didn't do very well on midterm judging from the date it was posted.\nIn my opinion, she's one of the best econ professor I've ever had. Her background; she had previously worked at JPMorgan rates trading desk(?) and for the Federal Reserve, and where did she go to grad school? MIT? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure. \nAlthough I've taken several econ courses, I am a philosophy major with no knowledge of finance and have taken this course just for fun. In retrospect, I think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learnt a lot about finance in this course. The textbook (Investment 8th Edition) was also good.\nThe other section was taught by Rajiv Sethi, and I attended both during the first 2 weeks to see which would be more appropriate for someone like myself. I chose Sally Davidson because Rajiv seemed to assume that we already knew the basics of finance and didn't explain much when introducing a new term and also because he used PowerPoint, which means that I would not have enough time to take notes. Yeah, I know it's my personal preference. Sally didn't use PowerPoint because it is a 9AM class and people would fall asleep but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very articulate, sometimes too loud. \nWhat I liked most about her is that she always gave us several examples to demonstrate how to use formulae or whatever she presented. Weekly assignment consisting of 5 questions was based on what we had covered in class, so it was, for the most part, very straightforward and was simply designed to concrete your understanding. I always fitted it in 3-4 pages, although it took me more than 7-8 hours. As I said I am not an econ major, so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry about it and besides, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re allowed to work with your friends. On several occasions, however, we had to draw a graph or compute numbers using Excel, which was not easy for me, because there was no instructions on how to use Excel.  One thing that I agree with the Oct. 28 reviewer is that solutions to problem sets are not helpful at all, but you probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need them. If you do, just ask a TA or Sally.  \nMidterm consisted of 9 multiple choice questions (5pts each,) 1 true/false explanation question out of 2 (15pts) and a longer problem (7 questions; 40 pts)    Although I screwed up multiple choice questions because I am not a good test taker, the exam was not very difficult when I revised it at home. Since she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cut the length of the exam this semester, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was impossible to finish it within 75 mins. As for grading, she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give you a letter grade for the midterm, but I find her grading very fair.  Also, she grades exams herself, which is nice. \nFinal was, of course, longer and covered more topics (quasi-cumulative - 75%) but about the same level of difficulty. She doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask you to give definitions of terms but you need to know what they are. \nAnother good thing about her was that she invited guest speakers to talk about things (Lehman collapse, asset management, money market mutual funds and reserve Primary) from insiders point of view.  (She brought sweets that her sister made :p)  She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly passionate about what she teaches and makes herself available when you need her outside her office hours. She is a very nice person and a professor, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad to take this course with her.\n\nWorkload:\nMedium-light.  Weekly assignment, Midterm, Final\n \n"

You won't learn anything you can apply in the real world besides using your calculator. Sally rushes through the material and gives problem sets that take 10-15 pages to solve each week. She asks you to buy a textbook but she never teaches the material. Instead, she is all about obsolete statistical analysis that nobody actually uses anymore. Her exams are 100% based on tedious number crunching. She doesn't care if you understand the concepts as long as you come up with a number. The exams are extremely long and even if you know the material you won't be able to finish. Sally's grading is also very harsh and will ruin your GPA. She is not a good teacher, murmurs silently things that half the class doesn't understand, doesn't give review sessions before the exams, and the \"answers\" she gives to her problem sets are simply the final numerical result, but no explanation of how she got there.  The worst class I have taken at Columbia. You will learn more if you just read the newspaper.\nWorkload:\nMany tedious hours of number crunching. She gives only numerical answers to her problem sets without explaining the steps that led her there. Take only if you love statistics and don't mind not learning anything about finance.\n"
