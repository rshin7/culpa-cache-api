Although she's just a graduate student and not a professor, I wouldn't want to be taught by anyone else. On that note,  don't get stuck with her roommate Rebecca... she'll make you hate the language!\nWorkload:\nWorksheets every night, quizzes, and the occasional composition.  Not hard at all! Russian 1102 is much more difficult, but it didn't take more than 1.5 hours/night to do the assignments. Enjoy this class! and the grammar lecture too! \n"

Natalia is a graduate student, but she acts more like an encouraging older sister. Her English is perfectly American (I'm pretty sure she grew up here), but her Russian sounds equally authentic. In the rare non-Russian-related discussion, she betrays a hip, with-it nature. Russian profs are always cheerful, it seems, but Natalia even laughs at students' lame jokes!\nWorkload:\nWorkbook assignments every night. It takes no more than 30 minutes. She assigns the occasional creative writing piece, which is more than manageable. Grading is picky; a couple of misspelled words can bring you down to a 4. (Russian system: 1-5, with 5+ denoting a perfect paper)\n"
