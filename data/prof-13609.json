His readings are really insightful, his conversations are really interesting and he is a really nice guy. 50% of the grade is participation and 50% is the final research paper. It seems like a lot for conversation but the topics are really interesting and you'll feel like sharing your thoughts. The readings are not too heavy at all, professor Spiro gives the right amount.\nHighly recommend.\nWorkload:\nWeekly readings - pretty light\n1 research paper\n"
