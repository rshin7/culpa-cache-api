I started taking the class and I was like dang ok, he's kinda crass but he's energetic and tries to engage you, not so bad.\nThen, I straight up failed the midterm, F+, class average was B+ and yet I still got an A in this class because I talked to him. I went to his office hours every week, had him read over the one writing assignment I did, triple freaking checked my weekly packet or whatever before I turned it in. Like all in all, it wasn't minimal effort (I actually had to try) but it wasn't too bad.\nIf you show him that you're trying and that you care, if you actually form some semblance of a relationship with him you will be rewarded!! He was so impressed with my progress and hard work after I messed up that he has offered to write me letters of rec and keep me on his radar for lab work.\nNot the easiest section but you will get through it. \nWorkload:\nHarder than other sections, he actually does grade the weekly packets for accuracy\nWriting assignment\nMidterm\nFinal\n"

Lots of people complained about his grading, but it\u2019s honestly very effort-based, as long as you write a lot you\u2019ll do fine. Bases his discussions on what we\u2019re having trouble with, which is nice, and he\u2019s knowledgeable and helpful. Go to the midterm/final reviews, they\u2019re really helpful. They curve FroSci grades at the end to try to make the different discussion teachers\u2019 grading equal, so don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not doing too good, your grade will almost certainly rise. \nWorkload:\nWeekly written homeworks, one newspaper style article (easy), one required museum visit, and some very easy SmartSparrows (online statistics reviews)\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class is literally GPA suicide. Don\u2019t expect an easy A. He is a good instructor but grades harshly. The homeworks are not graded based on completion but rather heavily on accuracy and they are extremely time-consuming. My friends in other sections had a much easier time. He is a good instructor and you will learn but you will have to put in a ton of work to receive an A, in my opinion, more work than is normally dedicated to a typical core class. \nWorkload:\nTypical fro sci weekly homeworks graded harshly(he will never give you a check-plus no matter how hard you try). Smart sparrows, a term project, midterm and final graded harshly.\n"
