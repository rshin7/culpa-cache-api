BORING AS HELL AND COMPLETELY USELESS. \nwith that said, ronit is pretty sweet and easy to talk to so the class was fine.  the work load is pretty light and most of it is completely mindless and not necessary to do.  there were weekly quizes and a midterm and a final... \nif you placed into this class and have to take it, dont worry it will be fine and easy.  if you are electing to take it, and you have a sufficient background in hebrew language then you are wasting your time!\nWorkload:\nlight \nhw daily, weekly quizes, midterm and final... \nall easy\n"
