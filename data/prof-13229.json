You learn about human biases, heuristics, decision architectures, etc. If you read Thinking Fast and Slow and Predictably Irrational, you would get most of the relevant information that you should know. Not sure what it says about the thoroughness of academia when 2 casual reading popular psych books cover your class material.\nThe mandatory attendance and iClicker quizzes were annoying.\nMidterms were pretty straightforward if you studied for them. There was nothing that was challenging as long as you memorized all the terms she gives you in the review sheet and understand them at a basic level.\nGood class. Would recommend if you're a psych major or just a person interested in business who needs to get a non-technical class requirement out of the way.\nWorkload:\n11 assignments (ungraded - just need to complete it)\nquiz questions every class for participation (can drop 5 of them)\n2 midterms\n1 final (cumulative)\n\n"
