            "review_content": "\nRishi's a fairly good lecturer and he'll take the time to answer the many lingering questions we had in what I thought was a difficult 'intro' course. \nThe textbook (Sheldon Ross, \"First Course in Probability\") is pretty bad, and it doesn't really help much that most of the lecture notes came straight out the textbook.\nThe text is not very well-designed for beginners, since it's heavy on word-problems and light on explaining things. \nThe homework problems are fairly difficult and will take you a while to do (which I might add were somewhat harshly graded). The midterm and final were both equally frustrating, the mean scores being 34/60 and 43/100 for each. Know your shit well, because you'll get near-zero partial credit for BS'ing your answers. I suggest you redo all  the problems from each chapter several times in order to pass the class. The exam questions are mostly from the book, anyway.\nWhat sucked most was that at least half the class were grad students who ruined the curve with their high scores.\nWorkload:\nA total of nine weekly problem sets consisting of 6-8 'theoretical exercises' from the book, worth 15% of your grade (but it doesn't seem to count for much in the end); a 35% midterm and 50% final with a fair number of questions coming straight out the textbook. He curves around a B.\n"
