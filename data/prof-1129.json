Sometimes I wish that he would make more of an effort to stimulate class participation and listen to our ideas. My confidence in speaking French did not improve. Oral skills are targeted in Composition and Conversation, which I will take next semester. \nI valued O'Keeffe's passion for the French language, literature, art and history. He sparked my curiosity about linguistics, since he'd tell us about how words were formed. For example, the word \"mayday\" in English evolved from the French \"m'aidez\" or \"help me.\" \nWriting about artworks in French vastly improved my writing skills as an art history major. It is helpful to copy the model of O'Keeffe's sample essays, handed out in class, because they are very straightforwardly and poetically. \nO'Keeffe is obsessed with literature and fables. Many of the paragraphs that we completed in class (by inserting the correct verb conjugations) were excerpted from Baudelaire, Baudrillard and other French authors. This made the usual painfully boring grammar exercises more fun and engaging. \n\nWorkload:\nExtremely light. O'Keeffe rarely assigns worksheets of homework in the workbook. \n"

He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funny, engaging, incredibly smart, and actually made me want to attend class. And since I literally almost didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the course due to the latest review, I felt like I should add a 2014 opinion.\nSo, suffice it to say, I got the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intellectual\u00e2\u20ac\u009d vibe but definitely not the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mean\u00e2\u20ac\u009d vibe. O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe was friendly, relaxed, and unusually interested in the class\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ideas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Instead of asking a bunch of rhetorical questions to see if we did the reading, he asked us what we actually had to say about it, and would often just stop in the middle of discussions to pore over our answers. And more than once, lo and behold, he even changed his own opinions after students suggested alternate readings. Class discussions are definitely focused on abstraction or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153theory\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c If you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t into that, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy the course, which sucks since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a requirement for complit majors. The upside is that O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Keeffe also believes in his students, and comes to class prepared to learn from them, which might make the process that much more enjoyable and worth your while. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d definitely take this class again in a heartbeat.\nWorkload:\nAbout work, grading, etc. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the most relaxed teachers I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had. I never had this confirmed, but I think that he occasionally offered paper rewrites, and he definitely collected a few essays beyond their due dates. I got the sense that he wanted to see our best work, and was willing to accommodate us if something stood between us and theses/topics we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d actually be interested in. So although my workload for this class was technically \u00e2\u20ac\u0153light,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d I found myself putting a lot more effort into my work, and gaining tremendously from it.\n"

I never felt nervous about talking in class and just really enjoyed all the lessons. He's just so knowledgeable on everything. I thought this would be a shitty, boring conversation class that would just help me keep my French going for a semester, but it was interesting and relevant and taught me so much about French culture etc, and improved my writing moreover.\n You only have one essay due, and it's structured such that you have a paragraph due like once every 2 or 3 weeks, which he corrects and hands back to you: so eventually, by the time you actually hand in the final draft, you just compile the paragraphs and voila, your French is flawless. He also lets you send in as many drafts as you like, which means, again, you can get a really good grade pretty easily. He also gives you, at the beginning of the semester, a \"cheat-sheet\" that's just a list of things like \"That said\", \"What flows from what has just been said\", \"Let us therefore consider\" etc in really poetic French. You just plug these into your essay with filler words relevant to your actual topic, and you're done.\nBut you learn a lot. You really do. It's the perfect balance between easy and actually helpful: my writing improved tenfold and he taught me how to actually use the subjunctive.\nBravo, Brian. 10/10\nWorkload:\nRidiculously light. 2 diary entries (2 pgs each) due every other week, 1 analytical essay, 1 resume in French. He edits drafts if you send them to him as many times as you like -- basically it's hard not to get an A if you even remotely apply yourself.\n"

Out of nowhere he can become condescending, dismissive, elitist, and aggressive. \nIt isn't that Brian doesn't have interesting things to say or doesn't push you to the next level of your own potential (which is what we should all want in a professor), he simply doesn't do a very good job in his delivery, which is to say that his \"constructive criticism\" often comes off as plain old criticism, served up straight and harsh. \nThis man is a character out of a novel.

Many reviewers commented on the occasional acidic or cutting comments he can make.  Having been on the receiving end of such remarks of his, I can also say that either he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been working on correcting it or PEOPLE NEED TO GET A GRIP.  Besides the fact, he is actually genuinely concerned with the development of his student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s writing and critical thinking, and is known to give people lots of extra help outside the classroom, extensions when needed, and even allowing re-edits for papers with below average grades ( if he thinks you deserve another chance).

Frankly, he will beat that dead horse all the way into the final lectures you will most likely have to have during reading week since getting through any material came second to his continued ability to jack off to his own intelligence in front of a room full of wide-eyed undergrad girls.  \nThis course left me with a sour taste in my mouth for the entire field of comp lit, to the point that I tried to change my major during the last week of classes, if only so as not to have to take another course with O'keeffe.\nHis attempts to impress us with his downness by inviting us for wine and cheese in his Harlem apartment (to and from which he insisted on personally escorting us) merely came off as obnoxious.

He not only has an incredibly impressive French vocabulary (something I definitely benefitted from), but also has a vast English vocabulary; I actually improved in both languages. The problem, however, is that i did not feel like I could participate much in class because the topics were over my head or he had so much more knowledge than me on the topic that I felt that my input would be useless. I've never felt this way in a class before and think that we should be encouraged to participate rather than intimidated. Like I said, he is almost too smart... but that is just my opinion. \nThat said, I did like his class. The levels of proficiency were certainly varried, but he was able to manage it realtively well. I learned so much, but in the end, wish more of the class had been held in French. (I'd say classes tended to be 75% French, 25% English).

That is the first thing you should remember when you are debating on whether you should take his class. \nI did not begin the semester knowing that I would be in his class. But from the first half hour of my time with him, I knew that I would be learning French in an entirely more engaging way if I continued with him. Aside from his British accent (and the occasionally whipped out northern Irish and American ones), Brian also has a great sense of humor that he dutifully incorporates into the learning experience, including in his worksheets and grammar lessons. There will be innuendos. There will be pop culture references. There might even be an assignment where you have to write a harlequin story. But above all, it will be in French, or translated into French. \nOf course, I don't want to depict him as entirely casual or \"fun\"--people can walk in late often enough, but he also commands respect. He will personally email you if you don't show up. He will not comment on your lateness, but you will notice the slight pause when you enter the room. Not of disapproval, but of \"It's fine that you're late, but I'd rather you were on time.\"\nWhy? Brian cares if you're learning. If you're sick for a few days, he'll email you and offer to help you make up the material. He'll delve into his knowledge and take out Wikipedia-like lessons on French slang. We learned adjectives entirely by looking at great French impressionism. We practiced new concepts on Baudelaire and other French writing. Towards the end of the semester, we read a poem written entirely in Middle French, which Brian apparently speaks. And all throughout the semester, Brian helped us remember terms or concepts by the etymologies of the words themselves. Hardcore in all senses of the word, if you ask me. I wish him all the best, and that he'll teach a French literature class sometime.\nWorkload:\nAbsolutely light. For a class that met each day, we had only a handful of workbook exercises every few weeks. We wrote 1-3 page essays that were all double-spaced.

You better know your Austen and Stendhal before coming in.

He first presents a topic, gives examples, practices with the class, and toward the end of the class day he has us split up into small groups and pratice what we've learned by writing a summary of a certain reading, or an original story in French using the tenses that he just went over. He spends a lot of time reviewing for even the smallest quiz, and especially dedicates several classes to reviewing for both the midterm and final. Brian is very flexible with due dates and extra help. He is always ready and able to assist his students, with much enthusiam. Plus, Brian's sarcasm and humor adds much fun to the learning environment. I would heavily suggest taking Brian's class... \nSince I only have one more semester of French to finish myself, I am looking forward to having Brian as my professor once again.

The class was that great! \nWorkload:\nVery light. Easy A. About 3-4 compositions, which he gives you at least 10 days to do. No readings or real homework. One or two quizzes. One midterm and one final. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThe class itself was great for anyone who has some working knowledge of French but doesn't know quite where they should fit in in the whole 1100/1200 business. It really helped for me to get back in touch with my French, and has definitely inspired me to get re-involved with the language.\nBrian is a pretty good teacher. I enjoyed the class a lot. He is very funny, and is very passionate about what he teaches and teaches you a good deal of slang that I'm pretty sure will come in handy someday (right?). He's pretty lax about attendance (I don't think he takes attendance actually...) and I don't know how much homework counted toward my grade. From what I could tell, the final grade was based mainly on your midterm (which was graded kind of harshly) and final and class participation, culminating roughly in what he thought you deserved, which to me, seemed pretty fair. Class was fun, but I really felt like I didn't have any idea what was going on. I think I would have liked more structure. I never knew when we had hw or what was due when, cuz it was sort of inconsistent. But, besides that, Brian was a great teacher, and I would recommend the class.\nWorkload:\nInconsistent homework assignments and lab work, 4-5 one page informal essays, midterm and final. relatively light.\n"

He's incredibly nice, and very funny, I looked forward to class (even though it was Tues, Thurs, Fri from 6:10-7:25). I don't know if he is teaching next semester (he just got his doctorate), but if he is, take his class!\nWorkload:\nummm...yeah\n"
