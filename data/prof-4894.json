Sometimes he goes off on little tangents, which are at least always very amusing.  The atmosphere was so relaxed and conversational that I never felt embarrassed to make a mistake, which in turn helped me learn loads more.  I would recommend him to anyone taking German, and I would definitely take his class again.  \nWorkload:\nPretty standard.  All of your tests and essays are set by the department, so it isn't really up to him.  He gave slightly more homework than the last professor I had, but it really wasn't a burden.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nAlexis is fantastic.  Where my previous german profs focused mostly on direct and constrictive grammatical drilling, Alexis approaches his teaching from a much more conversational and indirect manner.  As opposed to drilling, he has a conversation with members of the class in which they are expected to utilize the focused grammar in their responses.  \nClass with Alexis was never dull, he was always energetic and engaged.  In addition to being engaged Alexis adds a very personal note to his teaching and forms a strong relationship with his classes.  This only furthers the excellent experience.\nWorkload:\nRelatively light, but intense.  30min.- 1hr. nightly grammar exercises.  Bi weekly essays (200 words) and tests.  Tests are department written and are very straightforward.  Alexis' focus is on good class participation. \n"
