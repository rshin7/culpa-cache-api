Goes on random tangents and expects us to learn concepts in the textbook he never taught in class. Not that he does a great job of teaching organic chemistry anyway. Also, some of the concepts/mechanisms on his exams were concepts mentioned BRIEFLY in class; there's no way to predict what will be on the exams. He also gets upset when the class average is ridiculously low. TA's are arrogant and don't help much either. \nTo further attest to how bad this class was: people submitted signed petitions to administration about his grading system, exams and teaching ability. \nAvoid at all costs. \nWorkload:\nStudy on your own. \n"

Sames taught deceptively slow the first couple of months, and then towards the end of the semester he still kept his pace, but made us learn everything he didn't teach by ourselves in like 2 weeks. People were petitioning and emailing administrators to get him to change the grading system or material, but obviously nothing worked. His classes aren't informative at all, and you never know what to expect on tests because he doesn't give practice exams, and the problem sets were nothing like the actual exams. I can honestly say the best part of this class was it wasn't at 8.40am. Due to my schedule, I wasn't able to take Snyder's class, so I thought Sames couldn't be that bad - my my was I severely mistaken. The TAs were crap. They didn't care about the course or the students, and most of the time they weren't even familiar with the material. He likes to use a laser pointer, and every time he wasted time prancing around asking us what the eff his chicken scratch meant, I wanted to blow my head off. He was superbly unhelpful about questions and grading and the material that was going to be on any test. This is the quote that defines his class, \"We're going to cover selected subjects on X and Y chapter in the next class, but you will be responsible for the entire chapter.\" Well turns out we were responsible for the entire book (99.99%) for the final. The administrators told us that he probably added all the irrelevant biochem material to better prepare us for the MCATs, but I reckon I can tell bull**** when it's thrown in my face. Sames has no business teaching, he should just focus on research because that's what he's good at. Orgo is supposed to be such an important, fundamental subject, why does Columbia let horrible teachers like Sames continue w/o any amendments? Organic chemistry was my favorite subject and it still is, but this has been my least favorite class with my least favorite teacher with my least favorite TAs. I beseech you young minds to NEVER, EVER TAKE A CLASS WITH DALIBOR SAMES. EVER. \nWorkload:\nNothing that helps. Not too much or too hard, but a plain waste of time.\n"

If you value your sanity or your GPA or actually want to learn Orgo, avoid this class!  I can't stress enough how much you want to avoid this class.  Concepts you never would learn unless you googled them for fun WILL show up on your exams.  Don't know it?  Too bad so sad.  This guy taught like 6 chapters in the entire year and then pops another six we need to know on our own at the very end.

            "review_content": "\nWhere do I begin. Well one thing for sure....DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. ever. Don't make scheduling an excuse. Do everything in your power to take Organic Chemistry with another professor. First of all, this class is NOT CURVED. You might think, ok, so what. But listen. There is a predetermined grading point cut-off that is pretty generous, but nothing that gets graded (exams, problem sets, or quizzes) are graded on a curve. So you're on your own. With no curve, you would assume that exams and problem sets are fair. Nope. Not at all. Asides from being tough material, barely any partial credit is given problems (that are between 5-20 points each). My friend went over her exam with Sames and he said that she grasped the concepts, but since her answer was wrong, no credit. Boom there goes 20 pts. And another 20 here. Missed a hydrogen on predict-the-product-question? Minus 5pts...out of 5. What is probably worse is the fact that the TAs grade differently. You and your friend may have similar answers, but would get completely different grades. This is 1) organic chemistry, which is full of mechanisms full of steps, not one quick short answers and 2) the grading system is completely unfair. The class averages for all three exams have been low/middle B-s,and Sames has a great tendency to put the highest and lowest scores on the board, and while the highest score is not surprising, the lowest of 3/145 is first of all, very unfortunate, and Sames makes it even worse by frowny face next to it. WELL, we would be doing better if you taught us better!!\nAs for Sames's teaching style.... he comes into the lecture hall with a wine glass full of water, talks about how much we will be covering that day, and proceed to cover about 0.01% of it. There's not lecture notes, so you are forced to go to every class, but at the same time, it's not worth it. I would sit in class, relatively close to the board (the class size is small by the way, the wise ones chose other sections), and the whole class, my face is like a squished pug's face because of how small his handwriting is, and how incomprehensible it is. At the same time, it seems that Sames is teaching the blackboard and not us, the students, and talks in such a low monotone voice, so you would get a gold medal if you understand what he says or writes. He also likes to turn into a bio teacher every other lecture and take up a good chunk of class-time talking about biological mechanisms etc....\nIf you want to actually learn from the class, the TA's aren't too great either. The ones my semester were either too sassy to really answer your questions, or actually doesn't know how to answer your questions. \nNow the final. Be prepared to be tested on about 50% of the material that was never covered in class. I will never forget the lengthy email Professor Sames sent out describing the 6 or so chapters were were responsible for the final exam, even though we never covered them because of his terrible teaching plans and methods. \nDon't even bother to approach Professor Sames, or the TAs about anything regarding grades, the final, the class, your sanity, anything. They will think that their methods are fair, and then go one to say that it is our fault for not putting enough effort to do well in the class. \nSo like I said, avoid Professor Sames by all means. The fact that he has tenure does not give him the right to not care about his students, and really create a class like this. But yea, avoid his section. Even the post-bacs are complaining...and when the post-bacs complain, you know there is something very wrong. \nWorkload:\n3 quizzes, 3 problem sets (that are worth so little even though they are as long as exams), 3 exams in which the lowest grade gets dropped, and that terrible cumulative final + all the work in teaching yourself every single thing that you could have learn easily in class. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThe worst professor I have ever encountered at Columbia by far. Sames' complete lack of organization and commitment to teaching was appalling. From the absence of any sort of lecture notes or recordings, to his mumbling in class, to his inclusion of complex and ultimately extraneous biochemical subject matter that served only to confuse us, it was a herculean task to simply know what it was we were supposed to learn, let alone actually learn it. Unlike in Snyder's section, where students were provided with old exams, problem sets, lecture notes, and the curriculum mostly followed our textbook, Sames' class was a mystery as to what we needed to know and how in-depth we needed to know it. Quizzes and problem sets required us to know reactions and reagents that hadn't yet been covered in lecture, if they were to be covered at all. We also never got a single problem set back in time for the actual exam. Wow. The worst is that the class average is supposed to be a B-, which I can understand for a course like Biology, where the instructor was competent and understanding, and provided many resources for students to help themselves learn. Here, it was as if the professor was saying 'good luck, teach yourself all this material, fuck you.' I leave the class frustrated, angry, and demoralized. Any chemistry that I learned was a result of my own work and the TAs help, and definitely not Sames. Would not recommend taking his section to even my worst enemy, which seems to be the general consensus amongst my colleagues.  Christ was this awful. \n\nWorkload:\nOne quiz/problem set per exam, 3 exams with lowest dropped and a final. If you are forced to take his section for whatever reason do ALL THE BOOK PROBLEMS and as much of the other section's Psets as you can, when there is overlap. But really, just don't take the course with him. \n"

Basically, any reactions not mentioned in the book is far game (actually he probably will ask about them) but any complicated molecule/reaction will probably not be asked. take good notes in class- these will be very helpful, but his exams are also quite straightforward so anything that seems like a pretty big tangent, probably is, and therefore you will not be tested on it. Study his PS and practice problems A LOT the book problems are not at all what the exam questions are like. use the book for major rules but use class notes for detail. He also always puts extra credit problems on the exams which are usually easier than actual exam problems so take advantage of those! \nWorkload:\n3 exams one dropped, final worth 45 percent, 3 PS\n"

His lectures can be a bit disorganized, especially since he likes going off on tangents about his favorite molecules and mechanisms. Usually, only a very, very tiny aspect of those complex mechanisms is actually relevant to what you're learning. This tendency would be endearing if it weren't for the fact that at other times, he moves very quickly through the concepts, almost giving you no time to absorb the material. We ended up skipping an entire chapter this semester, and I think it must have had to do with his poor planning. However, he's pretty nice in person and is always willing to answer questions before and after class. I did get the impression, though, that he didn't care much for teaching. He occasionally cancelled his office hours without any notice (even if the exam was the next day), and one of the TAs had to fill in for him a couple of times this semester. \nHis exams are very fair. There are some tricky problems here and there, but if you do the book problems and the problem sets, you should be fine. He sometimes gets lazy with his test problems and uses problems lifted from the book (with only very minor variations). On this semester's final, he reused an entire problem from one of the earlier practice exams. \nOn the whole, I think Sames is as easy as orgo gets.\nWorkload:\nMinimal in orgo standards. Three graded problem sets (only a bit trickier than the book problems) and one ungraded problem set at the end of the semester. Three midterms (you can drop one) and a final worth 45% of the grade. Grades do NOT depend on the class average. 85 was the cutoff for an A for all the exams, regardless of the overall performance. \n"

The TAs frequently uttered things like \"Dali wants you to know this, although I don't know why.\" or \"This wasn't in class or the book but Dali for some reason thinks you should know it.\" The practice exams and problem sets are more useful than the text, but the answer keys they give us rarely have good explanations (or any!).

You'll probably bond with your classmates during this class as you will notice people bombing exams our of nowhere.  THis is a good opportunity to find a cute girl in the class to study with.  Something I should have done.\n3. Sames's tests areh tricky, though fair.  It might be the second or third one till you know what he's shooting for.  There are some shady ass questions though.\n4. You only need to study what he covers in class, alot of stuff in the book is never mentioned.  And contrary to other's opinions, I didn't buy the other book and I got an A in the class just studying my notes and the problem sets.  I don't consider myself a particularly smart or hardworking Columbia student.\n\nThings Sames needs to work on:\n1. Misses classes periodically and leaves teaching to TA.  I don't think Breslow ever missed.  Sames just got Tenured and i guess he's pretty busy.\n2.  Unlike Breslow, Sames is not famous or loaded.  he probably will not have as many cool stories.\n3.  The class is still at 9 am, I went to bed at 4 am every night almost 2nd semester.Brutal morning syndrome\n4. If you're like many in my class who thought they were badasses because they never had to work in high school to dominate, drop or start studying ALOT cause Sames doesn't mind giving alot of B's, C's, and D's to some of the brightest chem students in America.\n5. Sames is a classic case of someone who's really smart and good in the academic enviornment but just lacks that social ability to function in the real world.  He's a DORK.\n6.

A large number dropped the class after the 1st midterm.

After a semester with chemistry god Breslow, this class is an unbelievable let down.  Monday and Wendesday mornings will become the bane of your existence, because this semester you HAVE to go to class.  The curriculum is a hopelessly disorganized combination of the textbook, Sames's lectures, very difficult problem sets, and incomprehensible journal articles; the overlap between these is minimal, so studying for tests is nearly impossible.\nSames's lecturing style is also very disorganized.  He explains reactions by giving examples on the board. However, rather than picking basic examples, he picks the most complex examples he can come up with (you will be drawing rings until you would gladly shoot a benzene molecule on sight), so that way you will never know what the actual reaction is.  In fact, he will make relatively easy reactions needlessly complicated, seemingly just for the sake of confusing bewildered students (those who are still awake - I promise you, there will not be many.)  His monotone accent, combined with the 9am class time and the poor lecturing style, make it virtually impossible to stay awake.\nAnd then there's the grading.  Major, major ouch. The means for the 3 midterms were in the 50s and 60s.  About half the class dropped after the first midterm.  I am NOT a grade-grubbing pre-med, and I can definitely say that this was the hardest class I have ever taken.  The final was almost hilarious because it was so ridiculously hard; i say almost, because it also counted as 60% of our grade.  I got an A+ first semester in Breslow's class, and despite working considerably harder second semester, I got a B.\nOverall, it's still worth taking this class; you won't have to take gen. chem., you get 6AP credits, and you get orgo out of your way freshman year.  The price you pay, however, is a semester of pain and misery.  I am friends with a lot of people who took that class, and they pretty much all agree: Sames is awful.\nhelpful hint: for the final, STUDY AMINES!!!!\nWorkload:\n3 very difficult midterms, a final (the hardest test you will ever take), lots of reading/problem sets (that aren't checked) and optional recitations.

As for the midterms and final, if you don't understand the material really well, you're pretty much screwed. The tests are full of applications, with little or no straightforward questions. His questions assume a knowledge of the basic reactions and mechanisms, and then work from there. The problem sets are challenging, but our TA was always willing to help. Definitely go to his office hours; I never went, but I heard he was really helpful. Above all, if you want to know organic chemistry well, this is the class for you. Otherwise, get out. And although most people did better in Turro's class first semester, I actually preferred Sames and got a better grade in his class. He made the material seem much more exciting than Turro's dry lectures. NOTE: He claims that the Sorrell textbook is \"recommended\" but it's required for all the problem sets, and helpful for the midterm.\nWorkload:\nweekly problem sets, two midterms (he'll drop the lower one) and a MURDEROUS final. The curve is very good, probably because the mean grade is about 60 (out of 150).\n"

While the course may say Orgo, be prepared to learn lots and lots of organometallics (his pet field). He is a brilliant man, to be sure, but a disorganized teacher. Even so, the fact that this course gives 6 AP credits makes all the hassle worth it.\nWorkload:\nProblem sets, midterm, final.\n"

Granted, Sames goes on many hilarious and incomprehensible diatribes, but the tests were always fair. There's lots of studying to be done, though. It's certainly not as uncomplicated as the first semester of Orgo.\nWorkload:\nThere were two exams and weekly problem sets. Much of the material is found only in the lectures.\n"
