Your class will grow a bond after hating her for 3 months. You will not get an A, because A is for people who can write like Fitzgerald. \nBe prepared to never never get any feedback. She is often late, and will make you wait in class to compensate for the time loss, as if it was the class' fault.\nDO NOT CHOOSE THIS PROFESSOR. If you can, change it!!! it doesn't matter if you want to take a class and this one fits your schedule, DO NOT REGISTER FOR THIS!!!!\nworst. professor. ever.\n\nWorkload:\nIt would be a normal amount of work if she gave you feedback. Since she doesn't, you'll constantly have to go to the writing center, otherwise you'll fail the class.\nmore or less 800 words per week, and peer reviews oncce evry two weeks.\n"
