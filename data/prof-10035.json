            "review_content": "\nThis class was INCREDIBLE. If you only know a little about the Palestinian/Israeli  issue, you will leave this class knowing more than you could possibly imagine, as happened to me. If you know much about the issue, this class will provide you with incredible insight and resources to further cultivate your understanding and knowledge of the political and social background to the conflict. You will learn A LOT, regardless of how well versed you were in the issue before you took the class. \nProfessor Massad touches on all of the most important details of the conflict from its historical beginnings to our current day. He assigns readings that are super interesting and extremely informative. We were assigned readings written by Israeli, Arab, Jewish and Muslim scholars, and even read two novellas. Though Massad has come under scrutiny from Zionists for being biased in teaching this course, that is quite untrue. Just because he is a Palestinian professor does not mean he is incapable of teaching us material that puts the Palestinians in an unfavorable position when history points to that. We talked a lot about the incompetence of Palestinian leadership and a lot about Arab powers and their fluctuations in their attitudes towards the Palestinian question. Regardless of this, it is ignorant to call this class biased and illegitimate simply because Massad tells the truth about the atrocities committed on the Palestinian people. \nThough professor Massad is GENIUS and eloquent, he does tends to jump around during lectures in terms of dates, so try and keep a mental timeline of what events are taking place when. It might even be helpful to write one out. \nI highly recommend this class to anyone!! I took it to fulfill a gen.ed. but have become quite invested in the issue, and this class has also helped me shape my thesis for one of my majors. Though it was a lot of work it was really worth it. \n\nWorkload:\nThis class is INTENSE. We were assigned approximately 100 pages a week, but that easily increased throughout the semester. My TA (Cheryl Eve Leung who was amazing) assigned us 2 to 4 page essays due every week; she won't be TAing this course again, so workload in discussion section really depends on your TA. \nThere were 2 midterms and 1 final, which were pretty intense. They consisted of identifications and essays (for the midterms, about 7 IDs and 2 essays and for the final, about 15 IDs and 3 essays). In my experience, to do well in this class, you really have to keep up with readings and assignments. \n"

            "review_content": "\nCheryl is likely the best TA you will ever have. This class was very challenging with tons of readings and I definitely would not have gotten through it without her. The weekly assignments she gives forces you to analyze the text and think more critically, and she uses a variety of methods to get you to engage with the material while making it a lot more enjoyable. Yes, there is a fair amount of work but when exams arrive you will find that it was all worth it. She is extremely dedicated, passionate and very helpful. She has a high standard but she gives you the best chance of reaching it. You will be a stronger student after a semester with Cheryl. \nWorkload:\nWeekly assignments ranging from 2-4 pages a week and a presentation. Totally worth it. \n"

            "review_content": "\nCheryl is a great indication of why the lecture system (and some of the Global Core) is broken...because she demonstrates how these classes should actually function. This section is a lot of work, but you learn a ton and get very, very good at completing long form assignments. Even just taking this class as a junior, I probably learned the most about good work, thinking, and writing habits in this class. Her weekly assignments can be excruciating in a packed week, but she gives you a full week to complete them, which seems fair. She also provides video (Youtube) content and a paper assignment to get the class thinking deeper about the material, while also giving an actual CONTEMPORARY account of Islamic cultures (a major failing of Professor Saliba's curriculum). A major theme of the course is the portrayal of Muslims in the media, and Cheryl's supplements help to show the progress that has been made since 1970 in giving the \"Muslim world\" (itself a challenged term) some kind of voice and agency. The larger paper assignment is, again, more work, but she gives a solid variety of options so a) she doesn't read the same paper over and over again (a testament to her passion) and b) the writer can choose a topic that suits his/her interests. Too bad she will not be TAing this class anymore, but you would be lucky to have her in another class (if you are up to the challenge)!\nWorkload:\nDefinitely more than your average lecture class. She makes the 4 credits worth it, however. 4 page (average) assignments weekly, 6+ page paper (assigned by her), group presentations...plus the final and midterm of the actual lectures (which, unfortunately, make up most of your grade).\n"

I recommend taking a discussion section with her if you want to learn as much as possible and get a good grade.

Cheryl.\nIf you do the required readings, it is more than enough for you to be able to participate in recitation (and that counts for 20% of your grade in the course).\nWorkload:\nA bit heavy.

It's true that her section has a much heavier workload than any of the others, but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking to really get something out of the class then I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth it.  She is also a stickler for attendance and being on time, but she only has 50 minutes a week and manages to thoroughly go over all the readings and make time for discussion and student presentations in that short amount of time.  The reading list for this class is very long, but Cheryl kept us on track so that we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall behind when it came time for the midterm and final.  She also organizes 2 hour review sessions for the midterm and final on her own time, which I found extremely helpful in preparing for the exams.  (She also brings home-made cakes and cookies to class, which is a nice reward for the extra work!)\nIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not afraid of a heavy workload, can get to class on time, and really want to take something away from the class, then try to get into Cheryl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s section!\n\nWorkload:\nIn addition to Saliba\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading list, we had assignments due each week on that week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reading.  A typical assignment might be a 4 or 5 page essay answering specific questions about the reading plus several YouTube videos relating to the author or issue we were reading about.  Each person had to do two individual presentations throughout the semester on a specific author/article, and we presented in groups on one of the three novels assigned.  We also had to write a 6-7 page thesis paper on another book on the syllabus that was not part of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153official\u00e2\u20ac\u009d course requirements.\n"

She responds quickly to emails and goes the extra mile to make sure her students are prepared.

Definitely aim to get into her section if you can.  Still confused about the curve, because Saliba said that every recitation is curved individually so we all freaked out that if we all do well a 90 will be a B but in the end most people did fine.\nWorkload:\nHeavier than other recitation sections\n"

Unlike other TAs, Cheryl actually cares and wants you to do well too, so she's easy to work with. In the end though, it's not about how well you do in her section- she makes you want to know anything and everything in the subject. \nWorkload:\nThe workload in her section is quite a bit more than the other sections, but in the end, this is SO good for you. Because she makes you do weekly assignments and keep up on the readings, it makes it that much easier to understand what's going on in lecture and on the midterm and final. In the other sections, I think students can get easily lost and not know any of the material because they haven't been doing any work all semester. \n"
