Later it turned out to be otherwise mainly due to poor grading even after scoring high to range of 75-80 % marks.\nMid sem exam was reasonable but final exam turned out to be nightmare. He expected us to solve out complex mathematical problems using Matlab.\nAdvice: Do not take this course if you do not have strong inclination towards Data Compression.\nWorkload:\nAssignments were handed out almost every 1-2 weeks. Exams were take home.\n"
