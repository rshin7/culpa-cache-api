            "review_content": "\nKaye's a great professor all-around who's both passionate about the material he teaches and educating undergrads about it. His lectures are highly organized, and one might think that listening to an old professor read out of his notes about the Middle Ages would be boring, but his style and voice (which is very pleasant to listen to) make all of the material he covers seem extremely captivating. Some might find the thematic approach a bit confusing, but I appreciated it, and felt like all the material tied together in cohesive fashion by the end of the class, and really allowed you to appreciate the period and the vitality of medieval culture (and yes, Kaye does a great job of dispelling traditional stereotypes of the Middle Ages). Even if you're not interested in medieval history I'd advise taking the class- I'm sure you'll get a lot out of it if you don't go in expecting to learn about what people typically regard as medieval.\nKaye's also an incredibly enthusiastic and open professor who takes time to speak to undergrads and develop their interests in history outside class- particularly if you visit him during office hours, when he's more than happy to just spend an hour talking with you about medieval history in general even if you don't have any questions. He gave me a bunch of his old journals to read through once when I asked him and was more than happy to talk with me about the articles in them. \nIn terms of grading, Kaye is very fair. If you write good papers and give good answers on the exams you'll get an A. He doesn't grade to be harsh, but a certain level of accuracy and detail is expected in terms of your exam answers. He expects you to read primary sources closely and with attention to detail and an analytical mindset. The discussion sections are really helpful in that regard and even entertaining (Adam, our TA, has a great and very sarcastic sense of humor). \nWorkload:\nNot too heavy. Discussion post every week based on the primary sources, one 5-7 page paper, a midterm and a final with several IDs and one essay each. \n"

Because he's primarily a medieval historian, a lot of his anecdotes trail off into the 1200-1400s but I always found them kind of instructive in showing you a new way to look at the world and how we create history. Professor Kaye is incredibly approachable and makes class discussion insightful and engaging. Be prepared to work though because he expects a lot from you and is always invested in your growth as a student. I've had some papers that he refused to grade(let alone read)  because I just slapped something on the paper and he didn't think it was reflective of the quality of writing I had submitted in the past. So, yeah, he can be intense but it's also awesome to find a teacher who's so ready to support you, work with you and push you to write your best! \nWorkload:\nFairly heavy: short personal essay, 5-7 page theory paper, 5-7 page paper focused on a historical text, 2-3 page review on choosing and exploring archives, and then a 10-12 page comparative historiography or a research proposal in preparation for the history thesis \n"

He does an excellent job of making the material accessible and relevant to modern times, which helps your understanding of all of history. This class sparked my interest in the middle ages, and I promise you will not regret taking it. Do not listen to people who say this class is boring!! If you take the time to read the materials and go to office hours with Professor Kaye, you will discover that this is exactly the type of class that you hope to take in college with a dedicated professor and a subject matter that broadens your perspective. \nWorkload:\nVery reasonable--do the readings for discussion section and participate in class, and you will do fine.

If you take this class, you should expect to be bored witless. This course should be re-titled The Papacy until 1450, as most of the course focuses on the popes and the development of the Church. Most of the interesting history is excised in favor of church teachings and the development of law. In theory, the workload isn't too bad, but the boredom makes it worse. The teacher expected and graded you on your knowledge of the secondary sources for his exams. so if you unfortunately sign up for this class, you should make the effort to read the 2 or 3 articles he assigns each week and get a general sense of the argument and details. The grading is skewed towards the exams because he only assigns one paper.\nWorkload:\n2 exams - the professor expects you to use the secondary sources. 1 paper (5-7 pages).

This is by no means an exaggeration. This is one of the classes that will leave a mark on you.\nRegardless of what you may think about the Middle Ages, you will come out of this class fascinated by what you have learned. This class will open a world of knowledge and it will shed new light on the origins of the modern world. Professor Kaye often takes a moment to reflect about the way history unfolds and invites students to think with him. He always creates a comfortable and engaging environment.\nThis class will train you to think historically. You will mostly work with primary sources, which includes philosophical, religious, and literary materials. Instead of always giving bland lectures, Professor Kaye spends some time analyzing the sources during most classes, so he really brings the material to life, which makes it much easier and pleasant for students.\nThe course is writing intensive. There are 3 essay assignments, which comprise most of the work. There is also a final, but it is light and nothing to worry about. The essays are not easy, but they are exciting. Professor Kaye is also a fair grader who really gives his students the means to do great in the class. He gives thorough comments on each paper and makes time to give serious advice and feedback in person. Even if you already consider yourself a good writer, this class can really improve your writing skills.  \nThis class will have applications for you beyond the Middle Ages and beyond the discipline of history. I highly recommend it. \n\nWorkload:\n3 essays and a light final. The reading list not extensive - it's much more about quality than quantity because it's mostly primary sources. The grading is very fair and you are really given the opportunity to do great.\n"

He genuinely loves instructing students. I highly recommend going to his office hours. Your ideas will be more valued in this class than in a normal intro survey. Professor Kaye's passion for the study of history is inspiring. He makes medieval history relevant and engaging by constructing a narrative that favors thematic trends rather than a \"fact\" -based history you might get in an AP high school class. The best parts of Intro to the Later Middle Ages are Professor Kaye's lectures, but the readings are also interesting and applicable to the class as a whole. \nTake this class, or any class with Professor Kaye.

            "review_content": "\nThis was one of the most challenging yet immensely rewarding classes I had taken at Barnard/Columbia. The name, \"Introduction to Historical Theory and Methods,\" is somewhat of a misnomer. It is certainly not an \"easy\" introduction history course nor is it about mechanical research techniques. For those who thought history was about dates, IDs and maybe some essays, this class helps you understand what it really means to be a historian and, more abstractly yet so crucially, appreciate the value of a historian's endeavors and the field of history.\nThe seminar is structured as a discussion, as any seminar, and involves analyzing and critiquing/or commending the various ways of writing history (how to use footnotes, quotations, writing style, argument structure, primary source selection). From such discussions, you get a better sense of how to conduct your own historical research and write. The readings (scholarly history articles, Said, Chakrabarty, Foucault, Ginzburg, Darnton, Marx--all from scholars who shaped the field of history in unique ways) seemed intimidating, yes, and difficult, but the depth of understanding gained from our class discussions was always worth the time spent reading (and being confused by) the articles/books. If you take the readings seriously enough, you gain so much knowledge and depth.\nProfessor Kaye is a warm, extremely intelligent and honest professor. He will sit with your for an hour or sometimes more to talk about your papers (his handwriting is sometimes hard to read) and your concerns as burgeoning historians. He is no easy grader, but he is fair. When you get a grade in his class, you really get what you deserve. In class, the types of questions he asks us goes to show how Professor Kaye is not only a wonderful professor but also a thorough and passionate historian who understands the difficulties of history we grapple with throughout the course as mini-historians but loves his work and believes in the power and beauty of history. If you plan to major in history and want to be proud of your senior thesis, take this class.\nWorkload:\n3 5-6 page papers (first one is not graded); a thesis proposal; weekly discussion posts; readings and class participation\n"

Although some commenters have found his classes to be boring or his style \"pompous\"  I'd just like to say that if you think the middle ages aren't interesting, don't take the class.  If you think his class is uninteresting the first day, it will not be better.  I personally did nearly all the reading, and did not feel that it was any more excessive than any of my other 3000 level humanities courses.  If anything, I found it more interesting because as previous reviewers have stated, most of it is primary documents, allowing you to interpret the material first-hand.\nHis organization may seem a little odd at first, because it's not in chronological order, but when you get to the end of the class you'll surprisingly know it backwards and forwards.  As for those who don't think he knows who you are?  That's probably because you skipped every other class, never went to office hours, or made any effort. Don't be stupid: if you don't like the subject, you will not get a good grade or have a good experience, as with any half-decent course at Columbia.\nWorkload:\nStandard for an intro class.

The primary source selections were very good, and made up the core of the class, being the focus of the three assigned papers.  Professor Kaye's selection of secondary sources were also excellent, and they really helped to give context and relevance to the primary sources, which can be dry at times. Our class was small, which made lectures much more enjoyable, and really allowed us to have lively discussions about the different texts. With regard to grading, Professor Kaye was a very fair grader. He made the most comments on my papers of all my professors this semester, and I felt my grades reflected the level of work I put in. Ultimately, I earned an A- in the course, and was very proud of the papers I wrote. \nIgnore the scathing \"29 December 2003\" review of the course. This class was certainly \"real history.\" Female authors were never emphasized outside of their relative importance, and the most of the works we read were by men. During the second segment of the course--the \"Scholastic\" period--female writers disappear entirely. \nHowever, in a time when literacy was so rare (no more than 10% of Medieval Europe was literate), the writings of monastic nuns and female noblewomen become very important in creating a historical reconstruction of the time period. And for the record, I am a male Columbia student.\nBasically, if you have an interest in the subject matter, you won't be disappointed by this course. The readings are good, and Professor Kaye is friendly, smart, and interesting. You will learn a lot.\nWorkload:\n3 papers, 4-6 pg. each, and an in-class essay final. No midterm. The whole \"Barnard fellow\" situation has been nixed, so there are no required rewrites of papers. \nHowever, if you do want to rewrite a paper, Professor Kaye is very flexible.

The information covered in this class is also very interesting. However, it was frustrating at times to be a history major because it is so introductory. This is almost like a survey of middle ages history and you will dabble in a little bit of philosophy, religious history and politics, without really ever discussing the issues in depth. Also, there is hardly any reading. I think it's great that he focuses so much on primary sources, but we really didn't have any secondary sources, besides a textbook and a few articles in the course packet. While it's important to focus on the documents, it would have been nice to read scholars' opinions besides those of Prof. Kaye. Kaye is a good professor and he really cares- I would recommend this class to someone who truly wants an introduction to the middle ages, but if you want to take a real history class, it leaves much to be desired. In addition, since it's an intro class you often feel like you're being treated like you're in high school- everything's explained on a basic level (which is often good since most people aren't very familiar with the middle ages), but  it can get a bit tedious when the TAs go so far as to explain how to take an exam or write a paper.\nWorkload:\nShort paper on a primary source (5 pages), midterm, final- no surprises, he'll basically tell you what's on it.\n"

Despite his mellifluous voice, which rarely (if ever) wavers from its soothing baritone, he is PASSIONATE about the subject, and especially about the medieval economy (which appears to be his specialty). He always writes out a list of key terms at the beginning of every lecture, which turn out to be quite useful when studying for the exams. He is excellent at relating different social, political, cultural, and economic institutions to one another, at a level that isn't daunting for the first-year but also won't bore older students or history majors; another mark of his desire to establish a comfortable, communal class atmosphere is the 7-10 minutes he always leaves at the end of class for questions. Call it pandering to the firstr-years if you will, but I definitely appreciated it. That said, there is a strong anti-Bush sentiment that tends to come out when Prof. Kaye attempts to connect events and trends of the Middle Ages to current events and trends, and he's quite successful at both (to the point of heavy-handedness). Overall, though, I'm leaving this class with an even more profound admiration for the Middle Ages, and for this class that introduced me to them.\nWorkload:\nA moderate but steady reading load each week, ridiculously short responses to the reading due every week in the section, a fairly difficult midterm that was harshly graded by the TAs, one 5-7 pg paper, and a final.\n"

Perhaps a more appropriate one would be \"Medieval Intellectual Life and how it Marginalizes Women\" since more than half the course is devoted to just this issue (silly me for thinking that Barnard could actually put feminism on the back burner and teach real history). I must say, however, that Professor Kaye is indeed a very adept lecturer who blends (and often bends) insights, literature, and factual historical information to his own interpretation of how great and underappreciated the middle ages really were. Yet while this is undoubtedly a great skill, he tried too much to compare the medieval period to the 21st century with an all too pessimistic tone that I did not feel was necessary or too relevant. Again, his delivery as a lecturer is admirable; but if you want an objective, nonbiased treatment of the medieval period that does not overly focus on the mistreatment of women or draw too many comparisons to show how little we have come along today in modern times, then I suggest you look elsewhere (perhaps a real Columbia class). \nWorkload:\nThree 4-6 page papers that are very broad and incredibly difficult to actually narrow down to the page limit, and are accordingly graded on the tough side. Also an essay final, no midterm. Amount of reading is a bit less than the usual Columbia history class. Oh, and this class utilizes the Barnard fellows, who are supposed to help you with your writing but in reality make the entire process tedious, long-winded and just plain pathetic.\n"

            "review_content": "\nLike everybody says, he's a great lecturer.  He's got this beautiful, deep, mellow voice, that never gets too excited or upset, but is never bored, distracted or uninteresting.  His vocal style is a perfect reflection and tool of his intellectual style--he's passionate but calm and always reasoned, intelligent (brilliant,) fair and kind.  Since he never gets stressed, nobody else seems to, either.  He's generous with his time outside class, even if he has no idea who you are.  An all-around nice guy with a real interest in teaching and helping people.  He packs a tremendous amount of information into his lectures (a lot of which will surprise you, which is great--isn't that what an education is?) AND makes it all make perfect sense.  He introduces some pretty serious theories to the course, makes them very clear and concrete, and comes back to them again and again to make sure they're understood, remembered, and that their lasting relevance is apparent.  He teaches this introductory course as introductory courses should be--without expect any prior familiarity with the subject matter on the part of his students.  But he doesn't speak down to them either.  When it's all over, he leaves you with a good understanding of the major institutional developments of the era.  He couples primary readings with secondary texts, which also seems ideal.  I can say the secondary text is pretty dry--that's the only real complaint I have about the course, but you don't have to read more than 30 pages or so a week.  The primary sources are pretty fascinating, and mostly short.  Discussion sections were really valuable in providing a forum for dissecting these texts and drawing a lot more meaning out of them--and also asking questions of interested and educated TAs.  (Thanks, TAs, if you're reading this!)\nWorkload:\nThe reading is very manageable; maybe 100 pages per week.  One appx. 6 page paper on one assigned book.  Final and midterm involve essay questions as well as identifications--there is a LOT of memorization required, but he does tell you exactly what to memorize.  If you do it, and pay attention to his very cogent lectures, you can't go wrong.  (Only problem is that if you don't keep using all the names and dates and identifying info you memorized, you'll forget it, making it rather a waste of time.  I do wish more teachers dealt with that unfortunate reality.)\n"

At times I felt like blowing other classes off just to dedicate more time to this one.\nThe amount of information is huge, but he makes it clear what is exam material and what is not. His interest for the middle ages is inspiring, and by the end of the semester he completes his mission of showing his students the many layers of a society many times depicted simply as barbaric and ignorant. \nThe TA's are also very knowledgeable and approachable -- they are on your side and want  you to leave the class having absorbed as much as possible.\nWorkload:\nWeekly short papers (couple of paragraphs) on the assigned readings, Midterm, Final, 1 final 6 page paper based on a book.\n"

Becasue it was  a seminar he sort of let  the students run the class which was not always good becasue we often ended up on tangents which led to controversey.  Also, some students found him offensive at times, and while he says he was just trying to state his opinion, there was probably a nicer way to do it.  His grading system was otherwise fair and he was available to discuss grades and assignments\nWorkload:\nNot bad for the class.  Weekly readings varied between pretty long (and sometimes boring) and very light and easy.  If you dont always finish the readings its not the biggest deal just do it for the next time.  However, he required (bi-)weekly postings on courseworks which were very time consuming and often redundent from previous weeks postingsa or from those of other students. I think there were 4, 3-5 pg papers and peer editting (not a big deal).  \n"

Since the class was a seminar, and not a lecture, it was great to be able to sit down with a truly intelligent and caring professor every week.  He made class interesting with a relaxed feel to it.  Prof Kaye is kind of like that cool uncle that everyone wants.  He was truly interested in what everyone had to say and brought up great discussion points.  I'm actually taking another class of his next semester simpy because I love him so much.\nWorkload:\n3-4 papers with optional peer-editing.  Mandatory weekly postings on Courseworks based on the assigned reading.  Not bad at all.  Very fair grader.  He will make time for you to make sure you understand why you received a certain grade on a paper and work with you to make the next paper better. \n"

You always know what the important stuff is (or what to study for the exams). The work he assigns is relevant to what he teaches and very manageable. My favorite thing about him is that he reads many of the papers and exams after the TA's grade them and makes his own comments. He even raised my midterm grade a full letter from what the TA gave me. He teaches as if it is an INTRO level class, something many other History professors neglect to do.\nWorkload:\nEasy midterm, Fair final. One short paper and discussion groups each week with max one page response to readings. Exams are exactly what he tells you they will be, no tricks, so just pay attention in lecture.\n"
