If anything changes by the end of the semester (and I don't think it will) I'll make an update.\nFrancisca is an excellent professor.  Super nice, pretty funny, and overall just wonderful at teaching Spanish.  The majority of the class is in Spanish, which I think is really helpful for learning, but she will say things in English at times just to make sure the important stuff is clear.  She's very willing to answer any questions and makes an effort to get to know and to interact with her students.  Of the three Spanish classes I've taken at Columbia, this one is probably the most work-intensive but it's not too bad.  She assigns a lot of MySpanishLab (I think she doesn't know how time-intensive and annoying it is), which is a bummer and there is at least a little bit of homework from one or both of the textbooks due each class.  She's a kind of lenient grader in my opinion though and her quizzes (one each unit) are very easy.\nOverall, if you can take Spanish with her, do it!  You won't regret it and you'll learn a lot.\nWorkload:\nLots of MySpanishLab\nDaily exercises from the textbook (1-5 sections)\nQuiz each unit\nThree compositions\nFairly easy final project\nStandard midterm and final\n"
