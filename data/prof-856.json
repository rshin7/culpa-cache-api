            "review_content": "\nOne weekend afternoon, Professor Sidorsky sits two feet away from me at Tom's counter.  He has to know that I'm a student of his, right?  No one else is at the counter.  People say he's afflicted with terrible eyesight but I did raise my hand once or twice in class.  Even if he doesn't remember anything else about me, I'm still wearing the same stupid jacket that I always wear in the third row.  \nHe orders the exact same thing I'm eating.\nWhat the hell is he getting at? Is he getting at something?\nWe sit together in silence.  I keep glancing over, hoping to make eye contact.  He smiles at the waiter but never looks in my direction.\nCan I tap him on the shoulder?  I'm afraid he'll break.  Sidorsky takes 30 minutes to hobble across College Walk.  They say he used to be a famously liberal scholar but I worry that he doesn't want to talk to a lowly non-philosophy undergrad on his time off. And don't old people want to wait before being spoken to?  I don't know.  I don't know.  One time I told him that he was miscategorizing anarchism and he didn't end the conversation but didn't really respond to me either.  I take out my cellphone and pretend to look busy.  I don't want to go through that again.  He wrote a funny comment on my midterm and called one response \"interesting.\"  It was my favorite course of the semester so far and it could only go down from there.\nWorkload:\nThere are six topics covered over the semester (authority, rights, equality, liberty, justice, democracy). All you have to do is purchase one $30 coursebook.  The lectures and readings complement each other nicely. Sidorsky takes attendance, although no one knows if this means anything.  Each class topic has 2-5 readings, none of which were book-length.  Relatively easy...I kept up with the readings for the first half of the class and did all of the second semester readings during reading week (not recommended).\nNo other homework, only an in-class midterm and final.  Even the philosophy majors were knocked on their asses by the tests.  Half of the class didn't finish within time limits, and the questions are interesting but difficult to study for (asking for your opinion on a subject instead of a summary). \nI got a B+ on both tests even though I have little prior knowledge of philosophy.  Grades ranged from B- to A.  Sidorsky isn't as harsh with grades as you'd think an older professor would be, and he bumped everyone up by a couple points as well.\n"

That sounds like a really strange backwards compliment, but hear me out. Yes, Sidorsky is very old, yes, he can barely see, and yes he tends to move through the material rather slowly. As a result, some people gchat throughout class, some fall asleep, and some just don't bother showing up. But despite his slow pace, or perhaps because of it, Sidorsky presents concepts clearly and extremely organized. It's clear that he has been teaching this forever, and it pays off. Reviewing my notes, I realized how much I had learned, and I loved how organized and clear my notes were- a direct result of Sidorsky's lecturing style.\nIf you are interested in political philosophy, I would recommend this class to you. But if you prefer fast-paced, discussion-based classes, you probably won't love this prof. \nWorkload:\nSidorsky let the class choose between either a midterm/final or a paper. My class chose the tests. \n"

However, Sidorsky is pretty old; he couldn't see people's hands raised for questions, so after a month or two most of us gave up trying to ask questions entirely. \nAlso, there is pretty much no interaction with him at all aside from his lecture. Though he kept repeating  to himself almost every week that he should involve us in a discussion more often, he never did anything but lecture the whole time.  To me, this was a virtue of the class.  Instead of hearing my peers who have been in three philosophy classes, I got to just sit and listen to someone who has been studying philosophy for 60 years.\nGrades were based only on the midterm and final, which, contrary to his claims of them \"probably being easier than than they should be\", were actually disproportionately difficult, though not unreasonably so.\nWorkload:\nVERY short, dense weekly readings (2-20 pages)\nChallenging Midterm\nLong, difficult Final\n"

He is one of my favorite professors at Columbia and definitely one of the most interesting and knowledgeable. Yes, I admit, he may be very old, loves going on tangents, and sometimes strays from the syllabus. Some students might be bothered by this lack of structure in his teaching style, I think it is one of the best things about him! He has so many stories and experiences, and does not hesitate to spend large amounts of class time enlightening us with some real world philosophical anecdotes. I seriously looked forward to his classes and just sitting back and relaxing.  In addition, he reviews material a pretty slow pace, and usually covers important points multiple points...it is nearly impossible not to get the main points if you just go to lecture alone and do not read anything at all. There are required readings, but they are hardly necessary for earning an A. Seriously...if you are interested in philosophy at all, take his classes!\nWorkload:\nVery very light. Midterm, final, and perhaps a short reactionary paper or two that literally counts for nothing. Beware, however, that his tests require a LOT of writing. \n"

Also, on the first day he says that you have to have taken a philosophy class in the past or else this will be too hard. I almost switched out because he seemed really serious about it. Rubbish! No need to worry! \nWorkload:\nIt can literally be nothing if you want it to be up to the midterm and final when you study your notes. Oh yeah and we had to do a 2-page reflection on something.

I couldn't finish either one on time and I wrote more on them than I've ever written in my life. I also don't think it was an easy A at all.

We had reading assignments of ONE PARAGRAPH sometimes.  I'm not joking.  A typical reading assignment would be two pages out of the only textbook required for the class.  In a way I applaud him for not overreaching the scope of a semester long college course (although that would be a bit of an understatement), because I do feel like most teachers try to cram in way too much reading and no one absorbs anything.  However, it was simple too slow.  We covered the major moral philosophies, but I feel like I could've learned about as much from 2-3 hours of reading on Wikipedia.  Sidorsky was nice and sometimes told some great stories, but I only heard them when I could stay away.  Students' heads were dropping like flies.  I'd be whipsering to my friend for a minute trying to pass the time and then I'd realize that he'd nodded off.  The class is pretty easy.  He doesn't like to give below a B, and he gives plenty of A's and A-'s.  But, you aren't going to learn that much, and it's really, really slow.  If you think it's worth it to sacrifice your education to make a good grade and hear the occasionally interesting ramblings of a very very knowledgeable man, then take it.  However, if I could time travel back to myself and advice myself on course selection, I would steer myself away from this one.\nWorkload:\nAlmost no reading, no papers.

His class is great for philosophy majors, those who are interested in philosophy, or for those who simply want an easy class that they can learn some valuable information in.\nWorkload:\nCourse pack that is probably $30 and contains all the readings you will need.  You could get by without doing any reading, or at least get away with saving it all until the very last minute considering the readings are all short.  Midterm and Final that are long long long.

I assume that at some point a few decades ago he was competent, but it's time for him to be put out to pasture.

I suppose another reason to take him would be if you enjoy listening to anecdotes and stories and if you want to impress your friends and family by knowing random historical trivia.\nNot only does he not cover much material, he screws up the material he does cover (I've never accused another prof. of doing this, so don't think I'm some thinks-he-knows-it-all undergrad. This guy holds the unique position of being the ONLY professor I do not respect intellectually. He seems to have just lost whatever intellectual ability he had - and I don't doubt that he used to have plenty). \nOh, his stories may seem spontaneous but, having taken 20th Century Philosphy with him I can tell you that he tells the same damned stories in both classes (How can you trust the review of an idiot who didn't learn from his mistake and took two of this guy's classes? I admit that was really dumb. I needed an easy class on my schedule this semester and it doesn't get any easier than Sidorsky. Also, 20th Century was marginally better. If I had it to do over again, I may have still taken 20th Century, actually). \nWorkload:\nAbsolute joke. It does not get any easier. Seriously.\nThe ONLY people who may have trouble with this class are those who cannot write fast enough to get through his tests (either those who have to think an answer through before they start writing or those physically incapable of moving their pens quickly enough).

            "review_content": "\nWARNING: The reviews below largely ignore the fact that Sidorsky is probably not a good teacher for someone who has a serious interest in philosophy.  In Moral Philosophy we covered a grand total of 7 papers (in the form of interpreted excerpts from the textbook), which were each boiled down to about 4 or so very basic points.  Furthermore, the only meta-ethical paradigm covered was naturalism (how do you teach an moral philosophy class without even mentioning consequentialism?).  Sidorsky barely touched on problems with the Authors' systems -- if you like to read philosophy critically, it will be largely impossible for you to stay focused on the lectures for more than 20 minutes.  Moral Philosophy V3701, as far as the lectures are concerned, was largely a philosophy-qua-literature class in which memorization of the absolute basics of the authors\u00c2\u2019 ideas was the primary focus instead of using the ideas as a vehicle for coming to a deeper understanding of morality.  The upside is I guess that you\u00c2\u2019ll be able to say a few sentences about the historical context of these authors and their most basic points if their names ever come up at the dinner table.   Oddly, however, the excessively long exams ask you to evaluate the authors\u00c2\u2019 ideas over and over and over again until you can\u00c2\u2019t feel your fingers gripping your pen.  Overall, it\u00c2\u2019s a cinch to get a B, but pretty tough to get an A as its difficult to know what he\u00c2\u2019s looking for.  In conclusion: this class is not for philosophy majors.   I repeat: this class is not for philosophy majors.  Did I mention that it\u00c2\u2019s not for philosophy majors?  Annoyed?  Just wanted to point out that it\u00c2\u2019s not for people who can\u00c2\u2019t stand repetition (and not really learning much for your tuition).  \nWorkload:\nExtremely light:  7 readings, average ~10 pages each.  Reading was unnecessary as they were boiled down to 4 or so basic points over a series of 6 or so classes.  If you get someone to sign in for you and let you xerox notes, attendance is not necessary either.  Dreadful midterm and final that, while easy, were way too long and posed the same questions multiple times.  \n"

He is old, and sometimes he speaks slowly, but he has a profound understanding of the texts and is good at explaining them using his own examples. Furthermore, he has an encyclopedic knowledge of literature, and he weaves references to art, culture, and science into his lectures, thereby connecting the class material to other disciplines. Besides being informative, it is fun to watch his intellectual acrobatics: in one class he quoted the beginning of the Canterbury Tales in Middle Enlgish, a passage from Isaiah in biblical Hebrew, and listed a dozen Roman emperors in chronological order with their corresponding prime numbers (hmm, this sounds a bit crazy, but there was a point to it all). I gather from CULPA that Sidorsky has a reputation for repeating himself, but don't worry, this is not unselfconscious repetion. He goes over important points from the previous lecture at the beginning of most classes--something I found quite helpful. So take a class with Sidorsky while you still can. He truly loves learning, and it makes his class an experience you will be glad to have had.\nWorkload:\nNot much reading. An ungraded 2 page response paper. Midterm and final.

Plus, if you\u00c2\u2019re one of those people who likes to sit in the first 2 rows, you can do the extra 6-10 page paper to bump up your grade or score some extra brownie points with him. He might even remember your name.\n\n"

However, like your grandfather, he repeats things to death, as you finally understand what it was like to suffer through torture during one of the great wars. In those rare instances when someone actually asks a meaningful question, he unfailingly misunderstands his/her point, instead turning his answer back into that same, boring drivel he's been saying for the past hour. He may be considered an easy grader, but how can anyone do well when s/he doesn't care at all about the class? If able, you deserve an A for just having the stamina to sit through all his classes. Bring a taperecorder and play it back 5-6 times. Repeat every few weeks.\nWorkload:\n2 ungraded 1-page papers, midterm, final\n"

            "review_content": "\nThere's hardly any reading for the class, so Prof. Sidorsky tries to back up the material by making allusions to history, literature and music (he even sang in class once). While he's a walking encyclodpedia, he can be pretty repetetive and sometimes his allusions work better than others. As a result, if you're not feeling his reference of the day, you're going to pass out from boredom as you hear him mention it for the twentieth time. Worse, if you don't understand what he's saying, it's hard to steer him away from his theme. Still, some of his tricks work really well, even if he doesn't go into much depth (which none of his lectures really do). My main difficulty with the class was staying attentive, as his old man's voice and repetition makes it pretty easy to space out. This ordinarily wouldn't be that much of a problem, but because the class is so lecture oriented, it's important to pick up on whatever he says. \nWorkload:\nreally light. maybe 5-10 pages of wordy writing a class. midterm and a final. take (good) notes because when you look back on the twenty pages you read, you'll be glad to have whatever extra material you can. \n"

He repeats himself A LOT, but this is his pedagogical style. He is extremely effective at communicating the material, though it is easy to drift in class. Particularly when he talks about 20th C. philosophy, he has fascinating anecdotes (mostly because he was friends with these philosophers personally). For a taste of what college philosophy should be like, take this class!\nWorkload:\n2 ungraded papers, midterm, final. Generous grading\n"

He rehashes the same things over and over again until you want to shoot yourself. We move so slowly that it is unncecessary to stay after you've signed the attendance sheet, so long as you know someone in the class who will give you the dates of the assignments. I learned far more about each of the subjects from two CC classes than he addresses in the entire course. Worst of all, there are like three people in the class who raise inane questions that he misinterprets and debates with himself for 20 minutes at a time. The only plus is that it is total cake.\nWorkload:\nNone to speak of. 3 pages (yes, only three!) of reading per class from this really simple textbook, two ungraded one page papers, a midterm, and some sort of final (you vote).\n"

You will leave the class remembering these points. He gives a lecture class more than a discussion. Who wants a class discussion anyway? I'd rather listen to his sage insight than that of the obnoxious girl down the hall. How many CC professors can say they've read Plato's Republic 60-70 times? Remember, little sophomore student, always choose a professor over a graduate students - the older the better - the more knowledgeable.\nWorkload:\nSidorsky is the greatest!. Fair grader. The best!

He knows his philosophy very well, but he sticks with his own opinions. When he makes fun of people in class it is hilarious. He is softspoken and a good lecturer although he repeats stuff alot, which is good, because it instills the fact into your brain. Go to class, buy the little book. Don't read it, listen to the man, and you will do fine for exams. \nWorkload:\nThere is one small reader, which you don't really have to read. There is a midterm and final. he is a very easy grader.

He really really really goes over the concepts - rather than trying to get through a long reading list. Some found his style repetitive and complained that we didn't read a lot, I didn't mind all - he places the readings in the context of a \"paradigm\" and draws in all these anecdotes and arguments that he could talk about the first paragraph from politics for the whole semester and make it fascinating. Plus, you'll actually remember some of the stuff , and for the exams there's really no cramming needed, just understanding the main ideas. I really recommend this class - as an intro. Or later course... but you might find other philosophy professors hurried and shallow after taking it.\nWorkload:\nVery light. 2 ungraded short papers, 2 exams.
