If you are looking for a teacher that lets you slide by without being challenged, then she isn't for you (by the way, if you are looking to slide by without being challenged, I would presume to suggest you are probably at the wrong school).  If on the other hand, you really want to learn to write -- to generate original and creative ideas, to see and explore something from an entirely new perspective, to argue efficiently and potently, to write like a writer -- then I would highly recommend taking any course with her. \nHer class demands that you do the footwork and that you participate in the class discussions. But if you are open to a new experience and willing to do the work, then you will leave this class feeling that you have experienced an \"Ivy League\" quality class with an engaging and stimulating \"Ivy League\" teacher.\nWorkload:\nReadings, three 1500 word papers, a few short writing assignments in between the papers (short as in a page or less), and a final essay.  I'm telling you, the work is worth it...\n"

Fortunately they never impede the pace of the class. Those are really the only faults and there are tons of positives to tip the scales in her favor.  She is constantly energetic, inspirational and completely willing to work with you to improve your writing.  Critiques on papers are typically effective and she has no problem meeting with you to discuss what elements of your writing need particular attention. The class discussions are open and very enjoyable and she has no problem allowing people to explore new ideas during discussions.\nWorkload:\nNothing to write home about.  A final draft due about once a month, smaller drafts due in between.\n"

My writing improved tremendously and I can say confidently that I am ready to write any and all types of papers for Columbia. I looked forward to every class, the readings were interesting and I always felt I could reach out either by office hours or email if I was stuck or had a problem with a paper. Excellent class...I was shocked to find out that Alicia was a TA, she is as capable and educated as any professor on campus. Two big thumbs up!\nWorkload:\nBe prepared to write, write, write! Lot's of reading, writing and peer review. Work hard, take advantage of office hours and you can get an A.\n"

            "review_content": "\nBest TA I've had at Columbia.  I think the previous reviewer's hatred for graduate students unfairly colored his/her review of an enthusiastic and brilliant instructor.  Discussion sections were generally informative and interesting.  Alicia has a great sense of when a concept needs to be further explored and when it's time to move onto something else.  Although the course was a bit of a hot mess, Alicia taught an excellent section I found to be about as enjoyable and productive as an hour fifty minute night class can be.\nWorkload:\nI'm pretty sure the assignments and readings came from higher-up (Molly Murray).  A paper for each 'unit,' weekly primary source readings (random as hell), and weekly critical readings (the bulk of the value of the class came from dealing with these - fun stuff like Foucault and Said and Judith Butler).  Weekly discussion posts.  The grading wasn't free candy but wasn't unreasonable.  I received helpful feedback that helped me to get to the grade I sought.  Alicia is completely reasonable and approachable too.\n"

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insulting enough that Columbia won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide full professors to teach its required (and therefore most \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccritical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) classes, but Alicia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you call her Alicia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is palatable as far as things go.  A little over-indulgent of bad ideas, hyper-critical of good ones, vigilant for signs of boredom, insecure to the point of assigning arbitrary grades that elevate the lunatics and bring down the dons, but I could be describing all grad students.  The point is: you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much of a choice, and Alicia, all things considered, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a terrible one.  In person she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind and accessible and will talk with you about anything you want.\nWorkload:\nAnnoying but manageable.  Getting a good grade on papers requires extra effort over absolute quality.\n"

Alicia was able to break all of the negative preconceptions I had about University Writing. Going to this 9:10 class every day turned out to be much more of a pleasure than a chore. Not only does she try to improve all of the typically dreadful standardized UW assignments, she has a mastery of the reading. Also, if you get her, try to help her with the printing quota, since apparently grad students also have the same 200/week quota as undergrads do. Interesting fact(s): she was an undergrad at Harvard (she tried unsuccessfully to conceal this fact), and she has a facebook (haha!).\nWorkload:\nAssignments (200-800 words) due every class. Each of the three major essays are assigned with two types of drafts beforehand. Retrospective as well.\n"

She's knowledgable of and enthusiastic about the material, and she always has great suggestions on how to improve your writing.  She's a nice person and understands that students have a ton of other committments in addition to the work for this class, but doesn't let the class walk all over her.  One of the best things about having her as an instructor is that she puts in a ton of time and energy into reading students' work, revising it, and meeting with students.  She assigns a lot of challenging writing assignments, but you won't feel like you are doing pointless busywork.  I felt like every assignment helped me become a better writer in some way, even though it was stressful to do them.  When meeting with students Alicia sometimes gets overly enthusiastic and throws out too many ideas about how to formulate an argument or revise an essay, which can be confusing, but her suggestions are always great.    \nWorkload:\nThe workload is substantial, as I said before.  But Alicia will always match the time and effort you put into the assignments by meeting with you in person and writing very detailed, helpful comments.\n"

She earnestly tried to improve your writing and always made time for you to meet with her outside of class if needed. The bottom line is, we cared because she cared. Although she didn't perform miracles in making us all fantastic writers, she helped us see the path to what a fantastic writer was and maybe also cleared some debris, depending on what kind of shape you were in when you started. \nWorkload:\nNot once was she unfair or unreasonable with the workload, though given the nature of the class, most of us would have rather sporked ourselves than write another ccp outline. \n"
