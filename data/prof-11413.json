            "review_content": "\nI'm not sure if Manuel is an incredibly gifted instructor, or if Financial Accounting is the sort of class that could really be taught in a single month and happens to be stretched into an entire semester-long course. (Probably a bit of both.)\nHe presents the material very clearly, sometimes to the point of making things almost painfully slow. That said, while Financial Accounting is the sort of class that can be incredibly dry, he does a good job of making it engaging, despite the slow pace. At times, he would print out news articles or mention current companies in the news, just to make the material a bit less dry and abstract.\nSince a number of people are taking this class as a requirement, you get enough people to round out the bottom of the grading curve. If you're reasonably prepared for this class (remember your basic math - middle school level multiplication and percents), you should find this class to be very light.\nDo yourself a favor and go to class, and you won't have to do much studying for the exams. \nAlso, ask him about his days as a spy in the Israeli army. He's up-front about this (mentioned it on the first day of class). He has some good stories to tell.\nIn short, Financial Accounting will never be the most exciting class you take, but if you really want to learn the material (or need to take it for a requirement), I can't imagine a better choice of professor.\nWorkload:\n6 problem sets, very easy grading. In-class midterm and take-home final, both very straightforward. If you can do the practice problems, you have no reason not to ace both exams (and the course).\n"
