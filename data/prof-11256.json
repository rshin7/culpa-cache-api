He was also super-responsive whenever I emailed him with questions. He took the time to explain concepts to me and always did so with a smile-- he never made me feel stupid for not understanding the material and was incredibly patient with me when he sometimes had to explain things to me more than a few times. He is basically the sweetest person ever and the best TA I've ever had!!\nWorkload:\nhws every other week\n"
