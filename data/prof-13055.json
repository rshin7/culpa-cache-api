She did a really good job of covering all the material efficiently and making sure we understood everything covered in lecture. She was very personable, a reasonable grader and available for office hours and other meetings. \nWorkload:\nPiazza questions, weekly readings (short/easy) and homeworks (busywork but that's the nature of this course), occasional quizzes (typically in class, kind of a joke), a term paper, midterm and final. Pretty standard.\n"
