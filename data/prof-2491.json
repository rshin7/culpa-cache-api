There's a lot of readings but as long as you do enough to produce a response paper every week, you'll be fine. Go to the discussion section, it's really helpful. \nWorkload:\nweekly response paper, two 6-8 page essay, 1 blue book final (with 20 IDs and 4 essays). \n"

            "review_content": "\nGentzler is one of the more fantastic professors I have had. He is one of the cutest old men you could ask for, likely in his early eighties right now. Yet he is as sharp as a very sharp stick. You will wish he were your grandfather.\nDuring class, Gentzler lectures for much of the time, but some students asked questions and he responds to them in a very poignant manner, that I really don't know how to describe. He says things in a very serious manner that turn out to be 'jokes' (things that just seem funny to him) and then all of the sudden he will shriek out a loud \"HAH!\" and slap the table with his hand. The first time he did this, it took the class completely by shock, because he seems so harmless yet can make such a piercing laugh, almost a clarion call to arise from zoning out. By the end of the semester, we had all gotten pretty used to it, and I still treasure that laugh. It was the greatest. It was the type of thing where I can imagine someone saying something egregiously politically incorrect, pausing for a bit, with everyone around very uncomfortable, and then just cracking out a \"HAH!\" that would make everything all better. This all was the most unique part of the class along with his crazy stories and quotes. I started writing them all down because they were so wild, so I share some of the gems here:\n------------\nGentzler told a story about how he was talking with one of his friends, who happened to be the mayor of a small village in rural India. The mayor was telling him that he had been informed via telephone (the only one in the village) that a huge flood was rushing in and would destroy the village in 20 minutes. The mayor proceeded to sit down and make himself a cup of tea. Gentzler's response: \"If it was me, I would have bought up all the rowboats in the town and sold them at a very high price\". Presented completely seriously. Pause for a second. HAH!\nOn human nature: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one seat on the subway during rush hour...well, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why you bring a machete.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nOn question regarding subtle difference between actions and intentions: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not on a slippery slope...you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a pool of jello\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even though I fully know that Democrats are right and Republicans are wrong, I go out of my way to say good things about Republicans...for example, Ronald Reagan has nice hair\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153As soon as I see a bamboo leaf, I know its not a lizard...or a Maserati\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153In 50 years there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be sniggles, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be paying a lot of money for them\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on the ineffable path of technology\nOn things you should learn to be able to do in college: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Compare and contrast the New York Knicks to an elephant. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re too close\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot easier to paint a dragon than to paint a puppy dog\u00e2\u20ac\u009d ...because no one quite knows what a dragon looks like.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say anything good about Reagan but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say some bad things about Marx\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nOne of his very best, that caught the class very much by surprise: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no use being corrupt if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy it...there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing more enjoyable than seeing a little old lady kicked out of her house\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on how power corrupts and corruption yields power\nAlso one of the best: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Would you feel you were home if there were 4 new puppy dogs, new furniture, and the kitchen was in the basement?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on what constitutes a true home\nHe also had an ineffable disdain for French people and New Jersey of which no one could tell if he was being serious: \n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why French is still taught at Columbia, to tell you the truth\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the difference between Germans and French? Germans take baths\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n-----------\nLast night, I was really high and was looking at my list of quotes that I had written down. For every one, I can recall how Gentzler almost seems to not just have a twinkle in his eye when he says them, but to have a twinkle in his whole person. He is so wise and knows so much that I realized that in 30 years once I've begun to live my life and just acquire experience and wisdom about how the world works, all of the sudden I will realize that I can't after all find differences between the Knicks and an elephant. Or that the difference between the mayor making tea and Gentzler buying all the rowboats will prove to be an astounding insight that I will only fully understand then.\nSo my gushing about how interesting of a person he is aside, the course was pretty good. The course ostensibly covers China, Japan, Korea, and Tibet, but we spent only a few classes on Korea and one class on Tibet. Everything was interpreted through its relation to China, which seems a pretty fair way to me of giving a survey to East Asian philosophies and history considering it was always the significant player. He presented the class as the Eastern version of CC. It helps to be interested in the subject matter, because although the class is global core, you might get fatigued with so many recurring themes, and much of the class did not attend lectures during the last few weeks of the semester. There is allegedly a recitation section that I don't know if anyone actually went to.\nIn summary, you will get a very strong holistic understanding of East Asian schools of thought and their progression in relation to one another over the past 2500 years. You may not be able to remember who was Zhu Yi and who was Zhi Yi, but you get a very good feel for a different type of thought. He grades pretty easy and does not require you to know the reading for class discussions. You could just show up for class and not put much effort in and just listen to him talk and be enlightened.\nDo it for the unique experience.\nWorkload:\nA weekly 1-2 page response on the reading.\nReading assigned for each class, varies widely, from 30-90 pages or so of sometimes dense writing. But reading Confucius' Analects is very light. And the harder reading assignments you could read a little and get a sufficient feel for the material. He very rarely references the reading in class unless someone asks specific questions about it, which he also calls for.\nTwo 5-7 page papers. \nEverything graded decently generously. His comments make you feel very good about yourself at times. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI'm sorry, but this class was just kind of a bust. Don't get me wrong, I really liked Professor Gentzler- he's good-natured, loves to engage with students both in and out of class, and really does know everything about the subject matter. So if you're interested in the subject matter, then take the class. It is possible to get a lot out of it. But to give you an idea of my class, I think the main problem is that most of the students were, like me, just taking the class for global core credit. There were 30 people registered for my section, and about 13 wold show up regularly for class. Of the 13, 4 genuinely engaged, and the other 9 would be on their laptops, sleeping, or doing homework for another class. \nThere's a lot of reading, but after the second week, I only did the little reading that was necessary to complete the papers. But this meant that by the time the final rolled around, the whole class shared an \"I'm screwed\" chuckle. It really wasn't bad though. I would highly recommend meeting with Professor Gentzler about the papers outside of class- if you listen to his suggestions and do what he says, you'll do well. \nWorkload:\nA lot of reading, 1-2 page paper every week, two 5-7 page papers, final.\n"

I'm really writing this review because of the reviewer who claimed that he's semi -senile. He's most definitely not senile in any way, shape or form. I'm not sure why he/she wrote that - he is old, but very very smart. Excellent memory too.\nGentzler is not the most organized lecturer, but that makes sense, because he's not teaching some engineering class. His lectures are based on what he finds interesting, and he makes the things he find interesting interesting and accessible to the class, as long as you're smart and pay attention\nWorkload:\nWeekly readings, responses, a couple essays, not too hard as long as you work on them, moderate final\n"

He tried to make ours a discussion class, but it was a lecture. He commanded the material well, and drew comparisons between ancient philosophy and modern encounters.

He is very approachable and gets every assignment back in a very  timely manner and with lots of feedback.\nWorkload:\nweekly 1-2 pg responses, 2 papers (one around midterm time and one towards the end of the class), and 1 cumulative final.  the responses are kind of a chore, but just tedious not difficult, and they force you to keep up on the reading, which is very helpful come paper and final time, and you can turn one of them into a longer paper.
