His tests were almost impossible, incredibly confusing, and did not feel anywhere close to the difficulty level of homework problems or anything we covered in class. Again, he is so nice, just a frustrating teacher and a little disconnected from his students. Not a large workload, but a very difficult class. \nWorkload:\n2 midterms - 44%\n1 final-40%\n10 homework assignments (graded on correctness)-16%\n"

His classes are also really awkward, and he goes \"oh no\" every time he miswrites something which is kinda over the top sometimes.\nIf you took AP Calc BC, then you probably don't need this class. I got a 4 on that AP exam and they told me to still take Calc II for honestly no reason. It's a repeat of all the information.\nWorkload:\nHe gives weekly psets of about 12 problems\n"
