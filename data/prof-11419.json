            "review_content": "\n\nThis class is so much fun! Yes, that's right! Fun in a Math class!\nAnd professor Woodbury just makes it even better.\nIt works like that: There is almost no lecture. Each class the students volunteer to solve the homework problems on the board. It doesn't matter if they have or not a perfect solution (in fact it's better when they don't). Then the class would comment the solution, discuss it and get to a better one together. Professor Woodbury would guide this discussion with questions and comments. Then, every week there would be a group homework where each student should do 2 of the problems that were presented that week (or small variations of them). These weekly homework had a more rigorous grading and needed to be typed in LaTeX. \nSometimes, when we reached a part of the book with some very complicated concept or homework problems that were too hard, professor Woodbury would give us small lectures about that subject. His explanations were always very clear. Mike is a great professor, very approachable, not only during office hours but also by email and in the Coursework's discussion board. \nThis model of class worked very well for me. However, it is time expendable, since there is homework due every single class (although the problem sets were not long, something around 5 problems per class). All in all, this is a class I really recommend, especially with this professor. :)\nWorkload:\nDaily Homeworks due each class (they were 21 this semester).\nWeekly Homeworks (this semester we had 9 + 1 extra).\n2 Midterms (which were take-home. we had one weekend to do it).\n1 Final.\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nWoodbury is a gifted lecturer and a very friendly person. I found his class to be thorough and quite challenging. Woodbury expertly explained some of the more complicated calc IV concepts such as divergence and curl, and his almost daily repetition of the characteristics of conservative vector fields really helped solidify those ideas for me. I must criticize one of his practices, though. Woodbury likes to try out new things in lecture, so this semester he would pose a question similar to one of the homework exercises in class, and then give students time to solve it. Often, it was the second or third time we'd seen the concept, and so the questions would seem difficult (though to be fair he would usually do an example himself before asking the class questions). After giving students 5-10 minutes to do an exercise (or a few exercises), he would then ask students for answers. Once he heard the correct answer, he would write it on the board, and say something like, \"If you weren't able to to get this answer, then come to me after class, or read the textbook more thoroughly.\" I found this a little redundant. If I had wanted to struggle with exercises myself, I would just have started the homework. I would have really appreciated this new approach if he went back and explained how to do each of the exercises. His approach often left me and other students lost. This doesn't diminish Woodbury's rigorous approach to the material, his enthusiasm, or the level of detail he crams into each lecture. Moreover, Woodbury was eager to help in office hours, and I would recommend that anyone who struggles with the material make an effort to attend them. Calc IV is a difficult subject to study, and when you're tackling everything from surface integrals to triple integrals in spherical coordinates, having a professor like Woodbury to go to in office hours was reassuring. Also, the last three weeks of the course include a survey of complex analysis. While this part does not include WebAssign, the homework assignments for this part of the course are really challenging. Overall I would wholeheartedly recommend Woodbury's section.\nWorkload:\nHeavy. Unlike other sections, Woodbury utilizes both questions from the Stewart textbook and WebAssign problems for homework. I found that the WebAssign problems were often tedious and occasionally not so relevant to the concepts Woodbury was trying to teach. Generally, the textbook problems were useful to gaining understanding of the material and were good to review before the test. Woodbury had 2 midterms and a final. I found the first midterm difficult, but manageable. The average was around a 65 or so. The second midterm was highly conceptual and less like the exercises in the book (most of the class did very well on midterm 2, however). The average was around a 70. The final was more challenging than either of the midterms. Some of the integrals just seemed impossible, and there was at least one line integral where the proper strategy to finding the solution was unclear.\nGrade:\nFinal: 30% (covers everything from 1st and 2nd midterms, plus complex analysis stuff (Cauchy-Riemann integral theorem, etc.))\nMidterms: 25% each (1st covers double integrals through triple integrals in spherical coordinates, 2nd covers vector fields, Green's theorem, Stokes' theorem, fundamental theorem of line integrals, and divergence theorem)\nHW: 20%\n"

            "review_content": "\nGreat class. This was the first time that I attended almost every class of a calculus course at Columbia. Woodbury's explanations are extremely clear and he puts huge emphasis on making students understand rather than memorize the material. He starts on new concepts by drawing parallels from Calculus I, II and III and explaining how the new idea is just an extension of an old idea in many dimensions, vector form, etc. The homeworks and exams require you to understand the material but also to be able to apply it to solve different kinds of problems.Woodbury is also very friendly, makes it a point to get to know every student's name and is willing to provide help when needed. The calculus sequence is normally thought of as a dull requirement that simply has to be done, but I actually really enjoyed this class. Definitely take it with Woodbury if you can.\nWorkload:\nSee other reviews\n"

            "review_content": "\nStrengthening the previous reviews, Prof. Woodbury is a great guy, good teacher, and very approachable, not common qualities in a math class. Two things to keep in mind: The weekly problem sets, while usually not extremely difficult, were very long, consisting as they were of both online WebAssign problems (7-10 per week) and written assignments (similar). Together, even if you know the material well, these can take many hours, and if you get stuck it can be very frustrating. Then again, the TA and Prof. Woodbury are always there to help. \nThe second and more important point is: the exams are very challenging. Out of the three exams we had, only the second can be considered straightforward; the other two were very involved and, more to the point, necessitated more time than you had. The final included 9 questions, none of which were quick, and some of which had very complicated integrals; that leaves you with an average of 20 minutes per question, which- if you estimate 5 minutes of initial preparation and 10 minutes of writing down the solution- leaves very little room for error. So if you start getting mixed up, you might simply run out of time, something that happened to me on both the first midterm and the final. \nSo, my advice: it's a great class overall, Woodbury's very personable and is a good lecturer (note: if you take the class, try to make a minimal effort to show up and participate, if only to give Woodbury the positive feedback he deserves). However, prepare to invest more in this than you would in a typical computational math class if you want to get a solid grade. In particular, prepare strongly for the tests: do enough problems so that you feel you can answer a typical question not only correctly but quickly. That way, when the actual question comes up, you'll just have to figure out how it fits in to what yove already done you'll be set.\nWorkload:\nWeekly (long but not too hard) problem sets, both WebAssign and written, you get to drop two of each (i.e. two WebAssign assignments and two written ones). \nTwo midterms and final, very challenging but not removed from the material. \n"

His lectures are interesting, easy to follow, and appropriately paced. He's available for extra help, his tests are reasonably hard without being impossible, and the homework assignments and practice tests are very helpful in terms of test prep. He made the effort to learn literally every student's name (in a class of over 100 students) and sometimes tells funny little stories in the middle of lecture (not too distracting, but often a very nice break). The homeworks are intense (WebAssign as well as a regular written problem set) but are definitely doable. He scales well and drops the lowest few homework grades. I didn't have a strong math background going into the class but was able to follow it with little difficulty and definitely learned a lot. \nWorkload:\nseveral HW assignments (WebAssign and written), two midterms (doable), final (harder than the midterms but not the worst). \n"

            "review_content": "\nColumbia has a lot of intelligent professors, but very few of them are good teachers. Woodbury looks hardly older than a TA, but lectures like he's been teaching for ages. He is a naturally gifted teacher who takes the effort to make sure that every student understands the material. He is approachable and welcomes student participation. There are times when he makes mistakes on the board - please correct him, he'll appreciate it. He may seem to be moving along a little slowly sometimes, but he ensures that he explains every concept in detail so that you understand. This is a good thing. With all the homework and his great teaching, you really don't have to study much for exams. You can tell that he's very passionate about math because he points out neat stuff and shortcuts all the time. Woodbury doesn't like formulas, preferring to derive them on the spot from concepts - this helps boost student comprehension. He is also a very nice person to boot - by the first month of class, he knew almost everyone's name (there were about a 100 of us).\nThe first half of the semester was kind of boring as Woodbury did really basic stuff like vectors, complex numbers, conics and planes. The second half was much more engaging - he covered 3D geometry, quadric surfaces, partial differentiation, etc.\nThe first midterm was painfully easy. The second midterm was hell because it involved a lot of tedious calculations like differentiating a complicated 3 variable function three times and finding it's magnitude to get the normal vector. The final was between the two. Woodbury is a fair grader - not easy, not hard.\nHomework was heavier than other sections because Woodbury uses WebAssign but not bad. Note that you must purchase the textbook for $110 to get WebAssign. The PDF of Stewart Calculus you got from a friend won't help you here.\nWoodbury is probably one of the best Calc III professors. I highly recommend taking his class.\nWorkload:\n12 Assignments (each consists of a Written HW of 8-15 problems and a WebAssign assignment of 10-20 problems)\n2 Midterms (1 easy, 1 hard)\n1 Final (easy-medium difficulty)\n"

However, he drops the lowest 4 hw grades.\nHe posts a practice midterm before each midterm but refuses to provide solutions--he only posts answers. However, he does post solutions to hw sets before each midterm. He also provides a detailed review before each midterm which is VERY helpful. I often find that his typed notes that he ocassionaly posts are much more helpful than his lectures.\nExams/HW tends to be returned fairly quickly--1 or 2 class after it is handed in.\n\nWorkload:\nnot bad if you're good at math. weekly written hw/webassign, 2 midterms, 1 final\n"

Although I had to withdraw from his class for personal reasons, I'm very glad I took it for the time I was in it. He's a Native English speaker (always a plus at Columbia), so no worrying about heavy accents here. The notes he puts on the board are very clear and very well organized. Something that I noticed that other professors don't do is that he never uses a method of notation without explaining it to the class, which is very good for students who got AP calculus credit in high school but didn't necessarily learn set notation. He is very good at making himself available to students--he asks for input on when he should have office hours or outside of class review sessions (which he does sometimes!) and he made an effort to know everyone's names. He is also very passionate about math, which makes the class that much more interesting. He gets very excited about the concepts he's teaching and, if someone is juvenile enough to ask what's the purpose of learning this level of math, he will genuinely respond with, \"because it's beautiful.\"\nWorkload:\nTwo problem sets a week--one written and one WebAssign.

Tests are written clearly and fairly, and he's reasonable about adjusting credit on everything if the TAs grade weirdly.

This was his first semester at Columbia, and he's a young guy who just finished his PhD at Wisconsin, so I'd imagine he's a little inexperienced and can only get better as a professor.\nYou can tell that he really cares and is trying really hard, but sometimes you don't want to hear about line integrals in the complex plane for an hour and fifteen on a Monday morning. This is only problematic because, unlike a lot of other math classes, class is often unskippable: he never mentioned whether we could turn in our weekly problem sets in the box, like most other math classes, and there are six quizzes throughout the semester, which were all pretty easy, but their existence means you have to go to class at least some of the time.\nOn the bright side, he knows everyone's name and is really, really nice and generous with his office hours. And if you're ever up for talking about frisbees and Sufjan Stevens, go to his office hours or just show up to class early.\nI mostly wrote this review because I want people to feel comfortable that they're not doomed to a hellish semester if they choose to take Professor Woodbury's class.\nWorkload:\nNot too bad at all; weekly problem sets took 2-4 hours apiece, and the exams were all pretty straightforward.\nTen of twelve problem sets counted, but if you chose to get the online thing, you had four more opportunities, so there were pretty much sixteen opportunities to get your ten best scores. Two midterms and a final, but on the final, you get a cheat sheet with whatever information on that you could possibly want.\nHomework: 20%, Midterms: 20% each, Final: 40%\n"
