            "review_content": "\nProfessor Marten was one of the hardest working professors. You can just tell that she loves teaching and she is genuinely passionate. I think it also helps that she has other stuff going on in her professional life beyond teaching polisci so her life is dynamic which also makes her lectures dynamic. She definitely is engaging and makes you question on how you used to perceive global politics. In short, she's great lecturer.\nBut did I like her teaching style? Perhaps, but not entirely. First of all, you can clearly tell that she's biased. And for me, that was neither a bad or a good thing, but some people don't like it when professors are biased - so that's for you peeps. \nSecond of all, she goes through the frigging powerpoints so quickly. You look down and write some stuff, look up and she's talking about a completely new topic. And the way she writes all her notes up on the slides psychologically encourages people to write down her notes word by word when that clearly was not the case; hence many people end up just rewriting notes and not listening. At least I fell into that trap in the beginning. And she goes over rather complex ideas so quickly that you might lose track of what is being discussed at times, but if you do her readings ,you should be fine. But overall, her teaching style was just too quick for anyone to really copy down her notes - I would encourage instead listening more carefully and writing scarcely (although she doesnt post her powerpoint...) \nHer midterms and finals were definitely tough. Not the easiest bunch, although if you tried, you could get an A- at least. \nBut don't treat this as an easy \"A\" just because it's an \"introduction\" class. Also the grading can get subjective because different TAs grade differently - just gotta pray! \n\nWorkload:\n100~150 pages of reading a week - not required to read all tho. \n2 midterms - take home papers\n1 final - take home paper \nAll three were pretty challenging but not end of the world hard. \n20% participation, 20% 1st midterm, 30% 2nd miterm, 30% final. \n"

Had heard a friend complain about her lecture speed but she must have worked on that because it wasn't really a problem for anyone in my class. She's really adamant about drilling in the theoretical framework, but its good because it would be a really unpleasant surprise to figure out in the last week of class that you have no idea what's going on on that front. Coherent syllabus, relevant readings. She brought in a former Navy gunman to give a first-hand account of the Cuban Missile Crisis, which was really interesting.\nThe class is huge, and carries all those disadvantages, but its damn solid. Jervis may be the bigger name, and he may be a good lecturer as well, but I really doubt I would have gotten as much out of the class if he taught it.\nWorkload:\nA lot of readings if you do them all. But, they're not all necessary. In fact, she recommends to read them after lecture so that you know which parts are most important and which parts to skim. Standard course load for a poli sci lecture, if not a little light. Two midterms--one in class and one take home. One in class final.\n"

I would highly recommend this class for anyone even minimally interested in international politics...by the end of the class, you will have a new appreciation for the subject. \nShe's also really great outside of class. I highly recommend going to her office hours if you have any questions. She's very friendly and open (even with her 1000 Harvard degrees!). \nOne minor thing that I didn't like that much about the class were the weekly sections. They were not very productive, and I never really felt like I left having learned anything. The TAs are great, though!\nWorkload:\nNot impossible, but not easy. There are ~40 pages of reading per class before the first midterm (in class), and then about ~80 pages of reading per class afterwards. Mostly articles.

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Marten is a wonderful, engaging, and very intelligent professor. Her lectures are great, and I don't think anyone's tried to argue to the contrary here.\nThat said, there are problems with this course, though I would disagree with the nature of them as mentioned in previous reviews. Here's my take:\n1) As for accusations of bias: Professor Marten certainly does not pull punches when it comes to Russia. That said, I didn't really see much bias in her assessments. The Soviet Union WAS an economic disaster. Contemporary Russia IS extremely corrupt. Violent nationalism is prevalent. Money and power are concentrated in an extremely small elite while the masses live in abject poverty. You can certainly sugar coat these facts, but that's not the job of a political science professor.\n2) In terms of speculation: I agree, this was a big part of the course. On the other hand, the Russian government is pretty closed to scholarship, and often speculation is necessary. I didn't always agree with Professor Marten on her conclusions, but she did always preface her speculations with \"this is pure speculation.\"\n3) In terms of needing to agree with her: I didn't experience this.\n4) In terms of workload: I really don't know what the previous reviewer is talking about. Most political science classes assign 200+ pages a week or more plus an in-depth research paper, mid-term, and final. This class was nowhere near that workload.\n5) Class structure: The real flaw of the class is its weak attempt to integrate itself into political theory. IR theory is discussed and oversimplified in one class period, and theory is never again mentioned. \nWorkload:\nNot bad at all. 100-150 pages of reading a week, a position paper (7 pages), short reaction paper (2 pages), essay-based midterm and final for which you get to bring a cheat sheet.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAs the previous reviews said, Professor Marten is an extremely engaging lecturer; she is also, no doubt, an extremely intelligent and likable person. However, there are a few problems with this class you have to consider before taking it. First of all, her style can get overly enthusiastic at times, which makes her lectures look more like, in the words of one of my classmates, a 'puppet show'. Basically, a major part of her lectures, especially on the modern-day Russia, are based on pure speculations and emotions (believe me, she gets really, really dramatic at times). A lot of what she said was over-exaggerated or simply not true. Now, here comes the second problem with her course - she claims that you don't have to believe and endorse everything she says, but if you dare to express an opposing opinion in class, she will make you look like an idiot. Now, the third problem, which might be a problem just for me, is that the basic message of this whole class is that Russia is scary, corrupt, and horrible and the West, and, mainly, the USA, is righteous, free, and all-together wonderful. No crime that was committed by the Russian government can have alternative explanations, while all the crimes committed by the US government can be justified by 'mistake'. 'conspiracy theories', or 'negative public opinion at home'. Finally, the fourth problem with the course is its incredible amount of work, especially in the second part of the course. I know that many of the students, including myself, simply gave up on readings in order to be on time with all the papers, speeches, and negotiations for the project. Now, that all being said, I also want to add that the project itself was lots of fun and I would say that it made the whole class worth taking. Another good part about the course was its TA - Israel - probably the best TA I have ever had! He is incredibly smart and approachable. If he ever becomes a professor in Columbia, take his class!!! In terms of Prof. Marten, she is nice, and I got a good grade in the class, which is why I don't regret taking it, but I would advise to take all those things into consideration before taking this course.\nP.S. Oh, and, once again, if the class was supposed to give us an unbiased information and alternative views on the political situation in Russia, than why we spent most of the class talking and reading about Putin (including the whole 300-page on his reign) when Medvedev, who was only briefly mentioned both in class and in the readings, has been Russian President for almost three years now!!!!\n\nWorkload:\nHeavy, even for a pol sci course. The second part of the course is disproportionally heavy. two exams, two papers connected to negotiations, 2 3-minute speeches, one extra credit short paper (optional).\n"

It's been a long time since I've been able to pay attention for an hour and a half's worth of class, but she manages to keep your attention on even the most boring topics (oil politics in central asia, georgia's developing economy, etc). Rarely did I watch the clock.\nWith that said, this class was closer to history than political science. The first half of the course is devoted to learning Tsar chronology and how it impacts modern Russia. The second half is a bit more relevant, but still frustratingly centered around events. Marten shies away from applying theoretical frameworks to these events (Jervis, as a counterexample, really employs theory).\nOh, and it also felt like getting anything higher than a B+ was impossible. On the midterm, she told us she didn't give anyone an A, and only a few A-. Take it for what you will.\nWorkload:\nMidterm exam, simulation position paper, in-class simulation exercise, simulation reflection paper, final exam\n"

I was also surprised at her silver nugget status.\nPrevious reviewers neglected to mention the inability to engage with the professor over course material either in lecture where students dread the result of asking a question or at office hours where she only ever returns your question back at you. Despite her enthusiasm for the subject, Professor Marten seems like a very angry person and I was disappointed to have that directed at me on a number of occasions when asking clarifying questions in lecture or at office hours. A course like this has to be more than well put together PowerPoints and understandable readings. Even though it is not a seminar, the professor should still do better in terms of interpersonal skills and engagement with students if they are here to teach.\nHer inflexibility on class policies was admirable in its consistency, but extremely frustrating for a student who really was trying their best in this course. Students are only human and we merely ask the same of our professors.\nWorkload:\nReasonable, but you're entirely on your own unless the TA is enthusiastic.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI don't really need to write this review; this Professor's amazing reputation precedes her, and rightly so. But there aren't any new Russia and the West reviews, so here goes. Professor Marten is the best teacher I've ever had, period. She knows exactly how to represent all the different sides of an issue without losing her razor-sharp analysis in the process. When it comes to the complexities of Russia's foreign policy with its neighbors and the West, that is really saying something. She accomplishes this by staying very methodical in her explanation, using a ton of history to deeply explain each conflict, and then breaking down the various explanations, usually according to the major IR theory paradigms. \nThe course is likewise arranged very logically, starting way back the Tsars and then covering the USSR in its entirety before moving on to the Yeltsin and Putin regimes. Even if you don't agree with her on every point, that's okay, and in fact encouraged by Prof. Marten, to the extent that you can back up your views with sound theoretical understanding and use, and that you know a majority of the facts about which you speak. She will challenge you in discussion (15 minuts at the end of each class), no matter what position you take, so be prepared to learn to really hold your own and make more cogent arguments. This is a very big teaching priority for her. Debate is not only allowed, but encouraged.\n Finally, it was really fun to take this class because Professor Marten made it fun. At the beginning we made predictions about what we thought the next months had in store for Russian politics, and at the end it was a blast to get our responses handed back to us and discuss as a group how we fared. There was also a simulated energy summit that we spent a good part of the last weeks' time preparing for and which was incredibly useful for helping us understand probably the most complex of Russia's current geopolitical conflicts: the Ukraine gas crisis of Jan. 2009 and its aftermath. Take this class!\nWorkload:\n2 challenging exams, lots of interesting reading that you don't have to do all of (but it helps)... 7 page policy memo, 5 page retrospective, participation in the simulation was a big portion. In short, very doable.\n"

Expect to take notes as fast as you can for the entire hour and fifteen minutes, every time.  \nShe presented each of the competing theories objectively.  It was clear that she was trying to make the students pick a theoretical lens of their own rather than try to sell them on hers.  She was usually spoke very intelligently, yet accessibly, about most of the topics.  \nThat said, as a former veteran I was usually disappointed by her treatment of war and warfare.  I understand that she was speaking primarily to a group of 18-20 year old women with virtually no understanding of military issues (the class being taught at Barnard), but for me it came off as dumbed-down.  I agree with those who say that military issues are clearly not her area of expertise.  \nI also agree that she seems to relish tearing students apart when they challenge her viewpoints to any degree.  It didn't seem to make any sense. She may not realize how she comes across to her students when she puts them down in this way. \nThe discussion section was a waste of time.  This might have been because of my TA's style, I don't know.  He usually reiterated the theoretical frameworks and then asked the students to explain how the historical events in question should be interpreted through those frameworks.  There was very little interaction between students; it was all student-TA.  I had a difficult time understanding the theories this way.

My most enjoyable class because the material was related to everything we've experienced in life, politically, and all the significant parts of world (Okay, U.S.) history that make up our understanding of Foreign Relations. \nHer lectures follow a strict outline with LOTS of material to cover. She comes off as a bit of a bitch at first, but it has more to do with her not having time for individual questions in her already packed lectures, she's actually quite nice. More about this: Don't ask a question in the middle of lecture, write it down and save it for the end of class or she'll let you have it. Trust me, I know.\nThe most important thing you can do for yourself is put together a reading group after the first class. Go to the front of the class and just grab 3 other people to get started and then pull the rest from your discussion group. (Whoever sounds smart.)\nThe class was not hard, just intense, but the subject matter makes it interesting. If you are interested in 20th century history or politics in general then THIS CLASS IS A MUST. I have nothing but good things to say about it. Those who didn't like the class should have never taken it in the first place and then focused their complaints on Marten or \"it's too hard, wahh\" - They can all suck it. This class kicked ass!\nWorkload:\nREADING: Much reading, but if you get 4 smart people together you can divvy up the readings and email summaries to each other. My group had ten people, it worked out so that we only had to do 20-40 pages of reading once every two weeks. Piece of cake. Aside from that, most of the pieces are really good, about terrorism, the cold war, cuban missile crisis... very cool.\nMID-TERM/FINAL: The midterm and final are pretty much the same thing, she weights them evenly, but you get more time for the final. You also get to bring a double sided cheat sheet that you write or print out yourself. If you have good enough eyesight you can fit all your notes onto two pages. \n\n"

She's not really a \"performer\" in that she doesn't move around a lot or go out of her way to entertain you, but she is incredibly knowledgeable and her lectures are clear and easy to follow. The material was great and covered everything from WWI/II and the Cold War to Jihadism, peacekeeping and economic issues. My one warning is that the work load was enormous. Granted I'm a relatively slow reader, but I ended up spending 6-8 hours per class on the reading. A significant portion of the reading was not touched on in class and we were expected to master it for the exams.

However, there is always a cost, and the one you pay taking International Politics with Marten is high. Expect to have as much reading as all your classes put together. We probably read anything from 180-300 pages a week, and most of it was very dense material, which for you to do well o the tests you had to have a very good grasp of them, be able to refer back to them, and analyse them when writting you definitions and essays on the midterm and the final. Also you will find that there is not nearly enough time to say all you have to say since all of the issues are very complex,and there is always so much to consider when you are dealing with diverse and convoluted world.So yes, you do need to do the reading. But that being said you have choices on what to write on the test, so if you were able to only do the majority of the assigned reading for the week, you will be fine. In addition to that the reading and the information you are dealing with is so interesting that to a certain extent the readings became pleasurable. Even if you are not a poli-sci major the information you will learn from this class is extremely pertinent to today's world. The class is almost a very very very fast paced summary (with analysis of course) of every major international conflict since world WWI with emphasizes on the most recent issues. So the breakdown of the class is basically 1 section focusing on the main approaches to international politics, analysis of WWI, WWII, and the Cold War. The 2nd section focuses on political economy, EU, international trade, and 90s conflicts.

Professor Marten is member of the Council on Foreign Relations, has written op-eds for the NY Times, and was embedded with Canadian Forces in Afghanistan. She is well organized, and writes an outline for each of her lectures at the beginning of class. She is very clear of what her expectations are for her papers and exam. PAY ATTENTION to her directions. There are two 5-7 page papers that must be completed in one week, and a fair final that has 7 ID terms and two essays. You must do the readings! If you can't read all of them, at least skim the ones you can't get to, because for both the essays and the final you have to be able to synthesize, analyze and make comparisons of the readings at a much more sophisticated level than if you try to get by with just her lectures. To do well on the essays, make a strong argument, back it up with examples from the readings, define your terms, and address the opposing argument. Professor Marten does not shy away from controversy, and you will cover issues of terrorism, the Jewish lobby debate, and globalization. She is very engaging, even when presenting dry information. She is incredibly smart and funny, and very accessible. I wish her upper level classes were in areas that interest me, because I would love to take her again. I can't emphasize what a fantastic person she is. My one critique would be that she doesn't spend enough time addressing radical or progressive  frameworks and really relies on the dominant conservative and liberal frameworks. \nWorkload:\n2 5-7 page papers and one final. A decent amount of reading that MUST BE DONE in order to get a good grade. My suggestion: form a study group where each of you in responsible for one reading a week and swap summaries. \n"

            "review_content": "\nFirst off, everything you've heard is true: Prof. Marten is a fantastic teacher. She knows her stuff and she's really really good at explaining things. But there is one curious thing: I think she can be really malicious sometimes. Why? I'm not entirely sure. It's like she's afraid of being challenged or something, which doesn't make sense because a) she's the dept. chair, and b) everyone really respects her. But occasionally, it seems that if you ask a question that she doesn't like or point out an inconsistency in what she says, she just gets crazy and uncomfortably forceful. Very bizarre.\nExample: Prof. Marten gave somewhat confusing instructions on the midterm (citing is optional and not so important, she said) then came down on us after the fact and said \"you didn't cite enough!\" An international student with a heavy accent then asked a \"but you said...\" question and she just ripped into him, the poor guy. \nI'm hoping these episodes are due to some sort of exogenous factor because I like Prof. Marten so much that I don't want to attribute it to any fundamental character flaw. \nSo I say this: Prof. Marten is the best Intro to IR teacher out there, but just watch yourself. She has a darkside that is hard to explain or understand. \nWorkload:\nHeavy. Lots of reading, all of which is required. Harsh grading on the midterm. \n"

This is your spot.\nYou can sit with all the barnard groupies in the front row and worship Marten, as if she doesn't have a high enough opinion of herself.\nThis class is easy.  It doesn't require thinking.  It requires the ability to nod and take notes and take whatever your professor says to be the word of God.\nIf you want to think for yourself, ask questions, challenge yourself intellectually...then skip it.  Its not worth your time.\nIf you know anything about 20th century politics or international affairs, RUN.\nIf you enjoy asking questions, SPRINT: Marten takes any questioning of her 'infallible' theories as a personal affront.\nI have never written a poor review of a professor.  She never gave me a bad grade.  She never was a jerk to me, personally, in class.  I just watched as she shot down questions from anybody who had a solid background or half a brain.\nDissapointing.\nWorkload:\nIf you know how to skim, this is an hour and a half - per night course.

However, you need to have had some sort of a global perspective to begin with in order to follow a lot of what she talks about; if you've never made it a point of reading international news, then don't bother taking up a space in this class.\nThat said, Prof. Marten is a really engaging lecturer. She puts an outline up on the board at the beginning, which is incredibly helpful if you end up zoning out for a while. Definitely shop for a good TA, because the discussion is the only way to pick up on important points if you don't do all the reading. \nWorkload:\nHeavy and sometimes boring reading, 2 papers (dont expect to do these last minute), and a final.\n"

(I didn't do this...but I should have). I actually enjoyed learning from some of the readings, so I did all the ones that interested me. I found the class fascinating, but overwhelming too. It was history, current events, political theory, and application all at once. I do think she's an excellent lecturer. She's open to questions and some discussion even though she has a ton of material to cover every class and there were like 150 students. You can tell she's liberal, but she tries to present both sides of the story and each theory, which I find admirable. I talked with her during office hours a couple times, and she was very approachable after my initial anxiety. She's friendly and pleasant, and very smart, but human too. She was kind to grant me an extension when I was sick. I found that she was fairly available to her students, although she did travel because of her new book. I learned more in this class than any other. It made me think, and it definitely made me work hard. It was almost traumatic, but very worth it if you can handle a class like this. The TAs weren't too good about going over the material thoroughly.

If you talk to her in person, she's actually pretty sweet -- the barrier is definitely maintained, but I'm sure that if you visited her during office hours a few times she'd take it down at least somewhat if you were truly interested.  Anyway, enough psychological analysis; the class is pretty damn good, you learn a lot, and if you do the work, you should be fine.

She scared a lot of people in the class by saying she \"didn't give As\" which means that the two take-home midterms (5-7 pgs) are graded on a curve (I'd never heard of a Poli Sci curve but apparently the TAs are only allowed to give 20% As).  Not to worry, if you get a reasonable TA, all the other papers get a grade of B or B+.  My only complaint about the class is the TA sections--poorly organized and completely pointless but unavoidable, the TAs take attendance that counts for 10 % of your grade.  The newer material at the end of the course is pretty interesting--she actually gives a few lectures on bio/chemical weapons, terrorism, and the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (most courses that intend to make it to the present day don't make it past the 80s).  Overall she's a pretty good authority on the major topics in IR, and manages to give a nearly unbiased view of all the material (very rare for a Poli Sci teacher).

She outlines every lecture at the beginning of class on the board and sticks to it, making notetaking very easy. The course material she chooses is interesting and pertinent and she seems to be very nice as well.\nWorkload:\nMandatory recitations with TAs who aren't so great, two papers and a final. The reading list is absolutely enormous but you aren't expected to read everything word for word. Its a hard class but its worth it\n"

She provided very clear outlines on the board which she followed closely - making note-taking very easy.  Her lectures were always well organized, clear, and thought provoking.  By referring to her own research fields, Prof. Marten added much to her lectures.  She was also very willing to go over subjects with students during her office hours.\nWorkload:\nHUGE reading list.  While the list was incredibly long and time consuming, nearly all of the readings were thought-provoking and added to what was covered in class.  Two midterm essays (7 pg max) and one long inclass final.  Mandatory discussion section was helpful to review concepts covered in class, but somewhat uninsightful.\n"

Her reasoning for giving as much reading as she does is that a lot of polisci majors go to law school, so unless you fall into that category, you might want to look elsewhere for an intro to international class.  Her test were two take-home essays and an in-class final.  You had to sign an honor code for the take-homes, promising you would not discuss the material with anyone else, which seemed counter-productive to me, as she asked about current affairs.  Good news is it turns out the reading is not as necessary for your grade as she claims.\nWorkload:\nexcessive reading, two take-homes essay-exams and a final\n"

Her lectures are systematic enough so that they are easy to follow, but she is NOT a robot. She makes the information extremely lucid, easy to grasp and very interesting and applicable to today's political situations. She takes plenty of time to answer questions, and class time is well alotted. Martin is a fan of the socratic method of teaching and responds to many questions with further questions. Sometimes this is frustrating but it is often an effective way in urging class participation. All in all, a good class to take.\nWorkload:\nVery do-able...a lot of reading, but don't be discouraged at all! 2 midterm papers (graded fairly) and a final.\n"

A ton of reading, accompanied by some tough grading make it not a grade inflator. However, if you are interested in international relations, she is the best.\nWorkload:\nAbsolute absurd amouts of reading, 2 take home midterm essays (5-7 pages), final\n"

In person, she's very friendly - go chat to her during office hours - she's very likable and nice.
