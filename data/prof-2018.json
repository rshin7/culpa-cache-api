            "review_content": "\nThe best professor I've had at CU. He is so enthusiastic and NICE. He legitimately cares about his students. Of the three assignments we had, I turned in two of them late and he graded them normally. The readings for this class are absolutely amazing (Frankenstein, The Argonauts, Never Let Me Go, a few fantastic medical anthropology pieces) and while you could get away without doing them, I always prioritized them \u2013 simply because they are worth reading and discussion is worth participating in. He took us out for beers etc for the last class and is really just such a homie. Also open invitation to shadow him at the emergency department at CUMC (where he is an attending). Super reasonable grader. Not easy A, but an A is possible.\nWorkload:\nreadings every week, 1 casual 2-3 pg midterm: visit him at the hospital and write about the role of medical technology in emergency care or create a medical technology and talk about how it might be received, pros/cons, etc, final 8-10 pg paper on relationship between body and technology and how representations of the body in literature expand or constrain notions of consciousness, identity, and presenting one of the readings to the class, leading a discussion\n"

            "review_content": "\nRishi is one of the most helpful, enthusiastic, and interesting professors I have met at Columbia. Although I was initially intimidated by his syllabus and rules (\"tardiness is a practice that will be frowned upon\" and a 3 absence limit), he doesn't take attendance. Instead, you will want to attend his class just to watch him in action, sometimes getting so excited about a thought that he will write on the board so quickly as to be unintelligeable. He is very flexible in his due dates and syllabus, but he is also a very good editor and writing teacher, something it is not easy to be.\nWorkload:\na few ungraded short (1000 word) responses to reading, short reading assignment each night, three large papers (1500-2000 words), reading three books/plays by Samuel Beckett, with a presentation on one of the works.\n"
