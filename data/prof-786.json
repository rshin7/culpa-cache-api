He is so friendly that the class took him to dinner, and he invited us to a home cooked dinner at his studio. The class is geared more toward maturing your skills than your style, and to that end you try many different techniques. You can, however, do pretty much anything you want. \nWorkload:\nUse of each technique, and one large final project which involves a great dear of work but is worth it (if you can finish--finishing was rare in my class).\n"
