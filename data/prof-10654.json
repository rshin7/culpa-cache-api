I was excited to take numerical methods, but this guy does not teach. I could go on and on but I think this summarizes it: He shows you Wikipedia pages in class. He'll lecture on say, linear algebra, from an analytical standpoint, without ever getting into the NUMERICAL methods. The lectures are completely devoid of content and it shows in the fact that half the class is routinely absent; on quiz days, there is a marked uptick in the number of people in the room for the second half of class (quizes were given in-class for the second half of our double-session class).\nIf you see Deng listed as the professor for a class you want to take, run.\nWorkload:\nIt would be fine if he actually taught you anything.\nActually, it's deceptive. You can skate by on the easy problems on the homeworks, and then the final will be on the material you didn't do because he didn't teach it.\n"

Exams consist of coding on the spot, which is unheard of, even in computer science courses. Exams are poorly written and do not test you on your knowledge of the subject. Averaged to a C and plans to fail \"two or three people\" in the class. Wait to take this class if he teaches it in 2012. \nWorkload:\nridiculous\n"
