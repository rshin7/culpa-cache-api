He is an amazing dancer and is demonstrating all steps himself- which looks incredible, but at the same time he is very approachable and down to earth. He makes sure to pay attention to all of the students in the class and I really feel like I have gotten better thanks to him. I had very minimal dancing background before taking this class and no ballet background at all and I feel I have learned so much. Interestingly this ended up being the class I most enjoyed going to this semester. \n\nWorkload:\nCome to class! \n"
