I found his class quite difficult for an intro to economics class (that could be my personal opinion) but the problem sets were also very challenging for a lot of my fellow classmates. I enjoy economics but again the class was really boring you have to stay really focused to pay attention. \nWorkload:\nPretty difficult but not obscene. Problem sets were quite difficult and everyone needed a lot of help on them. Midterm/ final were more manageable.\n"

He assigns a fair amount of reading each night, however, his lectures hit the high points and basically cover everything you need to know. Everything else you might need to know can be found online since the texts are so famous. I didn't read a single text after the first week of class when I realized everything was online in summary form. \nThe papers aren't too bad. The papers were graded by the TA's and Weiman. I suspect each TA graded 1 paper and Weiman graded the last. And it was pretty clear which one was graded by Weiman. He is very accessible and willing to help and even read through essays. However, when he says \"this is a good paper\" after reading a draft, he probably means it's a B, B-. Very harsh and can be condescending with his corrections (both in office hours and on the papers).  \nI took the class for the econ major requirement and actually ended up enjoying it. It's interesting to learn the basis of modern economy. However, it is also the only writing intensive econ major requirement, which makes it outside my realm of expertise. \nWorkload:\nThree 3-4 page papers\n1 final (given a list of terms before that he picked half of to put on the final)\n"

            "review_content": "\nI highly discourage anyone from taking Professor Weiman's course. When one of my paper arguments clashed with his political views, I received the lowest mark I had (and have) received at Columbia. He claimed that the paper was \"horribly written\", and as writing is one of my stronger points, I sent the paper to various others (including a relative, who is a professor at Harvard). All of them claimed that it was well-written and reasonably well argued. It was not my strongest paper, but I would say it was B+ worthy. I received a C-. No one who read the paper could believe that I had received such a low grade. It was suggested that his comments and general distaste reflected personal biases, and though I was reluctant to believe that sort of thing actually happens here, it seems to be the case. While it is simply possible that I wrote a truly heinous paper, I do not think so. Also, constructive criticisms were severely under-developed and all others were unnecessarily biting. \nHe was also, in my experience, extraordinarily unreliable. He cancelled several meetings at the last moment, and then later blamed those cancellations on me (which was incredibly frustrating). He granted me an extension, which he revoked on the mutually agreed upon due date. There was no way for me to prove this, as the extension was granted during an office hours meeting (therefore, I had no written evidence. I did not think I needed it). \nIt is very possible that this was purely my own experience, but if he is like this with any other students, I strongly discourage anyone from taking his course. He takes himself far too seriously, which is not reflected in his lectures (in which he is often engaging and has some sense of humor). He also tends to go a little over-time, so if you're coming from Columbia (and need to head back to go to another class immediately after), you might be late. \nWorkload:\nModerate\n"

Don't get me wrong, he's definitely going to push you on things and make you back up your argument (with an argument and not quotes -- remember that. No quotes.) but he'll work with you until you get your ideas straight.\nHis lectures are always awesome and straightforward -- you know exactly what he's going to talk about in class, and even though he doesn't use slides or anything, it's always completely coherent and easy to follow. Also, he really knows his stuff. If you're interested in the philosphies behind the economics we study today, you NEED to take his class (and not just because it's required by the barnard econ department.) He literally knows everything. The man can quote passages from almost any known (and not-as-well-known) political economist. \nOne of my favorite classes. Wish I could have taken more with him. And I wish I would have used more of his office hours. (Also - discussion section is optional, but GO! He teaches one of them, and it's so great to be able to talk to him in a smaller setting. That's where he shines.)\nWorkload:\nThree papers and a final, or two papers and a longer research paper. I did the latter. It's not the easier option by any means, but it was the right choice for me. He definitely makes you work for an A, but I'd say it's not too difficult to get an A- if you do the readings and you put some effort into your papers. You can get by with not doing the readings, but you get so much more out of the class if you do them. I didn't do a lot of them and I regret it so much now.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI've had Professor Weiman for three classes and he's my adviser, so I thought I'd offer a more balanced perspective since some of these reviews seem to really contradict each other. The intro to economic reasoning class isn't the best to take with Professor Weiman. He obviously understands the material and I felt that he could communicate it clearly (admittedly, I'd taken AP Econ in high school), so it won't be a disaster or anything, but this isn't one of the classes where he really shines. \nIn the US History class and Theoretical Foundations, Professor Weiman is so much more engaging! He's obviously really passionate about the material for these courses, and it shows WAY more than in the intro class. His lecture style isn't much more dynamic than average, so you have to have at least some interest in the material to enjoy class, but he has a quirky sense of humor, encourages conversation and participation, and clearly has a ton of knowledge which he's happy to share. Professor Weiman is always happy to help with any question you have about the material, help you track down sources for research, and generally make sure you get as much as possible out of the class. \nOne of Professor Weiman's main strengths as an instructor and an adviser is his level of organization. You'll never be confused about when things are due or what is expected of you. He keeps an easy to understand, regularly updated syllabus and courseworks site, and uses the calendar function on gbear and courseworks better than almost any professor I've had here to make sure everyone knows what's happening when. He's really helpful and kind without being too hands on \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he even helped me figure out what to do when I got a jury duty summons. Basically, if you're genuinely interested in economics (especially economic history or thought) and want to be an independent student who can count on your professor when it matters, Professor Weiman is awesome. \nWorkload:\nReasonable workload for every class I've had. Generally, Professor Weiman does a really good job of encouraging you to develop your empirical reasoning/data interpretation/excel skills without giving tons of busy work problem sets. Readings are usually good to supplement your learning, but you won't be penalized if you don't have time to do them. \n"

I am very well aware that some people hate this class - it is philosophy-heavy, but really makes you more aware of the theoretical underpinnings of economics and its evolution as a science. Perhaps not a class for those who choose Economics due to its application to the business world, but definitely a class for the intellectual mind. Readings range from Smith to Marx, Keynes and Friedman. There is lots of room for exploring the issues you find interesting and Weiman is very open to questions. Make sure to attend office hours!\n\nWorkload:\nReadings are pretty heavy but not really all that necessary. Lectures are a pleasure and very structured. That's also how Weiman likes your writing - he is into innovative interpretations and applications (lots of examples) but be careful of stupid grammatical errors and repetitions.

Weiman manages to keep the class focused, even if the topic is something like a random bank run from the 19th century. \nHe keeps a tight, organized calendar on Courseworks, so the class is never really in the dark about anything.

History of the US with Weiman, and not only thought that the class was relatively enjoyable, but that Prof. Weiman was a very kind man. \nAs for the class, it was pretty light on work, especially for an econ class. There are 'required' readings every week, but seeing how the midterm is take-home you won't be hurt if you skip some/most of them. \nMy interest level in the lectures varied based upon the topic that was being presented, with some eras/discussions less interesting than others. Only about 1/2 the class showed up for each lecture - which he laments - which is an indicator of how the class tended to feel about the presentations and how unnecessary they are to be successful in the class.\nThe primary concern of the whole class revolves around the final paper and presentation which are tied into each other. The two add up to 55% of your overall grade, and both take place in the last month of the semester. Groups are formed early on based on 3 panic periods in American Economics, and within those groups, students assign themselves to a specific topic. This topic is directly reported on in a 15-20 minute class presentation (powerpoint). From the main topic, you select something a little more specific/researchable, and back it up with primary sources in a 10-12 page paper. This can create a daunting few weeks of work, but it isn't very hard and can be interesting enough if you select a good topic.\nOverall, I would recommend this course to any econ majors who want an escape from a lot of the graphs/equations/problem solving that is so familiar from the pre-req's/some electives. Not difficult and pretty stress free, save for a few weeks at the end. \nWorkload:\nWeekly readings, take home midterm, 15-20 min. presentation, 10-12 page research paper, final (really, just a 2nd midterm). \nNot too bad at all.

I would guess that this is usually a major class, and there were only about 25 of us in the class, but it was a great class. Weiman changed the syllabus this semester so that we could focus on panics and depressions in the United States over the past few centuries. His lectures tended to be pretty boring and all over the place, but after the first few weeks of class, the group-student presentations began, which tended to be pretty interesting, as long as the student speaking sounded semi-intelligent. Professor Weiman was extremely helpful whenever a student needed anything. I got very sick during the middle of the semester and he gave me a large extension on the take home midterm, allowing me to do it over spring break. He was also helpful to all students when it came to finding sources for our presentations and for our final papers. The presentations were based on different panic periods, and each student ranked the period that he/she wanted. The class was then split up into groups of 5 or 6 for each period. Each student was graded separately, specifically on his/her presentation. Overall, the class was interesting, not too work-heavy and Weiman was very understanding and encouraging when it came to doing work for his class. I would advise econ majors who need to fulfill their upper level electives to take this class! \nWorkload:\nattendance is semi-mandatory since participation is 5% of your grade but many students skipped class regularly, a take home midterm that was based on the reading of 2 books, but one could skim the readings before writing the 2 essays and still do very well on the essays, 1 group presentation (each person presents for about 20 minutes), 1 final paper based on your presentation\n"

Weiman is also not very accessible, he spent all of last semester worrying about his son transferring to a different school, so his office hours were very limited.

Many students did poorly on the longer essay, so they would have been better off taking the final exam instead. Weiman does not really help with the final assignment, he just kind of throws the idea at you (but it is your own choice if you decide to write the long essay instead of taking the final exam) and you kind of just have to do it on your own.

In retrospect, I'd say you should print out the powerpoints before class, since he posts them on courseworks (however, they aren't especially helpful for studying, since they consist of a lot of bulletpoints or questions that he answers in class, so good notes are more important). Also, you should at least skim the reading so you have a better idea of what's going on in class.\nThere are three exams--the first two aren't cumulative, and the last one has a short section of questions from earlier in the semester, on top of a longer section of questions from the last third of the semester.

Some may find him boring, his lectures to be sleep-inducing (not helped by the fact that the class was a Mon-Wed 9AM), but it is clear that Weiman knows his stuff.  He's a clear lecturer, and if you stay awake in class to take notes you WILL feel better about the quizzes (which tend to be easy) and the midterm and final (which are not quite as easy).  The textbook is expensive and boring, and not a whole lot of it is on the tests.  I think he does a decent job of preparing students for the final, and if you go to all the classes and do the practice and graded aplia assignments, do your reading and all that, you should be fine.  \nThis isn't coming from someone who did exceptionally well in the class,.  As a matter of fact i didn't do nearly as well as I could have.  From my experience, just make it to the class, even though it's early.  It'll pay off in the end.  \nWorkload:\nBuilds up if you don't do your reading.  3 chapters in the text perweek, 3 annoying excel assignments, 2 quizzes, online Aplia work, articles posted on courseworks, midterm and final\n"

After taking the course, I want to be an econ major.  His lectures are interesting, clearly outlined and on courseworks. He answers questions in class and during office hours well. While the average grades are low, they are curved, so if you read the text and don\u00c2\u2019t skip class you can be on the top of the curve and get an A. \nWorkload:\nThere are two midterms that are curved, two quizzes that don\u00c2\u2019t count for much, 3 excel assignments (the recitations help with this), and aplia assignments. There are 5 aplia assignments and only the top 4 are counted. The text book is clear but time consuming. There are additional articles to read, but if you go to class then you don\u00c2\u2019t have to read them because he covers the material there (the exception to this is the CBO report).

            "review_content": "\nWhat a nightmare this class was!  Had I known that econ majors consider Weiman to be one of the most boring lecturers ever, I probably would not have taken this class...and now that I've experienced Weiman for myself, I KNOW that would not take this class again or any other that is taught by him.  Please bear in mind that this class is called \"INTRO\" and there are no prerequisites; however, I often felt unable to comprehend Weiman's lectures because he seems to assume that his audience follows him.  He often abbreviates terms without clarifying what he's abbreviating and likes to give major assignments that have no immediate basis in the textbook.  Weiman also likes to hear himself talk and he does a lot of it, and aside from random moments of humorous sarcasm, you'll want to tune out his whiny monotone voice.  While he's extremely organized, his lack of clarity is an issue.  All I can say is that thanks to a bunch of outgoing question-askers in the class, some things were clarified; but in general, I felt like I was sinking in quicksand.  Do not take this class if you have no interest in econ or if you do not have the time to camp outside Weiman's office for his weekly office hours.  Another thing, expect there to be major curves in his class to make up for the lack of teaching.  In my opinion, curves are only necessary (especially on his grandiose scale) when professors are not getting through to students.  As a side note, if for whatever reason you choose to take Weiman's class, make sure that you know how to use Excel!  \nWorkload:\nOne midterm, One final (he calls it a '2nd midterm' and it's not cumulative); 3 empirical assignments (excel-based); semi-weekly online problem sets (Aplia)\n"

Asking him questions is like getting teeth pulled; he lets you know that you are wasting his valuable time.  The lecture doesn't break up into sections, though, so if you do have questions you're kind of screwed.  My class had one TA, she was literally 70 years old.  While she was very nice, she wasn't exactly accessible...plus, she couldnt hear anything you said.  Also, the few assignments that we did have were returned about 3 weeks after their due date, since there was no one to grade them except Weiman and the old lady.\nWeiman is very whiny.  He'll walk into the classroom and find his desk out of place, or a piano in front of his lectern (the room is used for music classes as well), and he'll moan, \"This is NOT in my contract.\"  Then he'll call the custodian and bitch to him.\nNeedless to say, I did not enjoy Weiman's class.\nWorkload:\nNot very much at all.  Which, in the end, wasn't that great.  Maybe if we'd had problem sets, I would have known if I understood the material.

The class is rich with information, both in terms of historical facts and in seeing how economic theory is realized through events in American history.

For students who pay the least bit of attention, his excitement about the subject easily inspires their own.  The readings he selects reinforce the text and delve deeper into the more important topics.  Overall, they're extremely interesting, though a few may be a little dry and empirical for the non-econ students.  Most importantly, he's a good teacher (and a nice guy to boot).\nIf you have the slightest interest in economics (in general) or American history, I cannot recommend this class highly enough.  It is easily the best overall class I've taken.\nWorkload:\nFairly heavy reading, especially including the optional readings that add extra oomph to the material.  But it's worth it.  The good news is, if a particular topic doesn't interest you, the reading is often skimmable.\nOur semester, we had to participate in several online discussions about selected topics.  I've never really found online discussions to be interesting or helpful, but these weren't terrible.\nThere's a final paper assignment (~15 pages), done in pairs, on a topic in the economic history of New York City (chosen by you and your partner and approved by Dr. Weiman).  Dr. Weiman's helpful on every step of the paper, from topic proposals to research guidance.  Pick something interesting, because you will become a near expert in it by the end of the semester.\nThe midterm and final are very fair.  Standard \"8 questions, choose 5,\" short essay/long answers type of design.  If you've done most of the reading, or at least paid very close attention in class, you should have no trouble defending your T/F answer or explaining the significance of and relationship between two terms.\n"

However, what is key, is to do the reading. If you don't do the reading, you will have no idea what's going on in the class, and hence you will be bored to death. However, if you do the reading, he asks some very insightful questions that really make you think.
