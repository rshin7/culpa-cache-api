            "review_content": "\nProfessor Mylonopoulos was a great professor. One of my favorites from last semester, if not my favorite. I had taken Professor Di Angelis's Roman Art class before and had gotten used to that sort of Art History class and it was great but when I went to Professor Mylonopoulos's class, I was pleasantly surprised. The midterm and final was an actual test with short answer questions. The Professor actually invests time and energy into this class and two museum visits are mandatory in which as a small group, students have to speak about pieces that we mostly have never seen before. He truly wants to see that you understand and cares about how much you have learned. His lectures are always interesting and they are very enlightening. You can tell that he enjoys teaching, not just teaching because he has to. He teaches so well sometimes you don't even know it. Even if you don't think that you are learning anything, when you start studying for his tests, just by going to his lectures, you'll see that you know more than you thought you did just by listening to him speak. He has one paper due in the class and he is always willing to become involved in the writing, from the topic you pick to the actual writing process. He even makes it a point to announce in class the fact that you SHOULD go and ask him about your paper and that he wants you to talk to him about it. I found him to be very accommodating when I had hundreds of questions about the paper. He even responded to an email I wrote at 3 in the morning five minutes later and always responded to any email with any amount of questions I had to throw at him. I highly recommend this class to any person with an interest in Art History. \nWorkload:\n8-10 page paper, midterm and final are tests and weekly readings which you don't really have to do....I didn't. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI think most people from Mylonopoulos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 class would disagree with the previous review. Mylonopoulos actually did a lot. He taught us how to describe what we saw and compare it to other things in order to come to an understanding of the art through our observations (and some historical context, which the readings gave us). He carefully guided our conversations and had us do a lot of looking and talking, but I think it was clear that his intention was to empower the students, not embarrass anyone. Professor Mylonopoulos encouraged each and every student and was extremely patient while we all learned how to look at art. He is generous and attentive, happy to answer questions outside of class time, and definitely wants all of his students to succeed. For those students who are not motivated: go to a different school. Everyone else: Professor Mylonopoulos is great. Take his class.\nWorkload:\nFair amount of reading, 3 papers (first one ungraded), midterm, final, 2 museum visits.\n"

            "review_content": "\nBy way of teaching, Professor Mylonopoulos does little. After a brief introduction to the syllabus, this class of unenthusiastic students was asked a question that we would hear several times every class: \"Now who would like to describe this?\" Most students, myself included, knew nothing about art and, having been given no parameters, fumbled awkwardly and embarrassingly through their descriptions throughout the entire semester. Professor M gave little to no historical context or information regarding the artists or artwork, relying on the students to talk for the entirety of the class--I learned more from Wikipedia. He is pleasant enough, but his extremely minimalistic teaching style is suited to only the most motivated and interested students, something found rarely in a core class such as this. \nWorkload:\nvery light (and he is an easy grader)--light reading, midterm and final, 3 papers, 1 presentation and 2 trips to museums outside class time\n"
