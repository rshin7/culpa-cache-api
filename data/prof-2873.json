            "review_content": "\nMaiken is generally pretty good at facilitating discussion (and her Dutch accent is very cool).  You're required to give a presentation on one of the supplementary readings and also required to meet with her before the presentation.  During said meeting, she tells you almost exactly what she wants to hear in the presentation, which doesn't leave you with much elbow room.  But the everyday class discussions are fairly open to find their own path.  Overall a good class and a good professor.\nWorkload:\nReading: One play and usually two supplementary articles per week; Papers: take home midterm paper and final seminar paper; not bad at all for an English seminar\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class and professor are both so-so. You'll learn a few things about genre theory (which surprise, surprise, is really boring), you'll read genre criticism, (which is worse), you'll write 2 papers, both of which you will get A-'s on, and ultimately walk away feeling embittered about the pre-1800 requirement for the department.\nThe saving grace of the class is the syllabus. Marlowe, Webster, Jonson -- quite engaging actually, when all that genre theory is ignored (which you ultimately abadon by the end of each class because it is so god-awful boring). \nAll in all, don't take it unless you need a pre-1800 and an A-. \nWorkload:\nmidterm paper, final paper and a presentation which is surprisingly difficult to put together (renaissance drama ain't no henry james).\n"
