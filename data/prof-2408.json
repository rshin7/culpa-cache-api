            "review_content": "\nAna is absolusely lovely. She is extremely patient with the class and is very understanding. She takes the time to make sure that everyone understands everything, and while she likes everyone to speak french all the time, she has no problem re-phrasing something in french 5 times until the whole class understands. She tries to make everyone speak in class, although it is possible to get by without speaking that much at all, which unfortuantely means you don't necessarily improve your spoken french THAT much unless you make the effort yourself. She tries to make the class fun(some fridays when very few people would show up we would play hangman in french), and she brings in supplementary material that is interesting(we read some of  Napoleons letters to Josephine and some Moliere). I would definately recommend her as a teacher for this level of french.\nWorkload:\nVery low impact. 4 compositions and re-writes which almost always recieve A-s and then go up to As if you change it just a little bit. 4 tests, very generously graded in my opinion(she gives a lot of partial credit and will ignore tiny mistakes). Homework assignments for each class which are never checked(I know for a fact that at least half of the class never even figured out how to do the oral exercises online). Study for the tests, spend a little time on the compositions and you should do well.\n"
