            "review_content": "\nIf you are a writer, do not take Aaron Hamburger's workshop if you can avoid it. I'm a writing major, so I've taken classes with most of the professors in the writing department, and I just don't understand why he is teaching at Columbia. Especially since the other professors in the department are all so amazing. \nAaron uses rubrics to evaluate your stories. That means you get a 1-5 score in Plot, Character, etc. Maybe some people find this useful, perhaps if you are new to writing and need some structure, but it really is not useful in an Advanced Workshop. It is important to talk about the elements of fiction and how to use them, but a generic rubric is honestly just disheartening. As for Aaron's critiques of our stories, they were often very general, outlining how your story doesn't fit his idea of a story, but without specific examples or suggestions. \nIn class, Aaron is energetic and fairly pleasant, I suppose. He brings in lots of inspirational quotes and random writing exercises, which sound like a good thing, but they never really went anywhere. Also, be prepared to defend yourself when you're up for workshop -- he ignores that whole code of silence thing other workshops use. And although he acts sort of \"nice\" I could never really tell when he was being honest. And isn't honest feedback why we take workshops? Finally, he never, during the whole semester, seemed excited about writing. To me, fiction is a labor of love, so it was weird to be the student of someone as uninspired as Aaron. \nWorkload:\nNormal for a workshop. 2 Stories for the semester and critiques of your peers every week. Revisions on both stories for the final portfolio. A few exercises here and there.\n"

Having glimpsed several of the student evaluations at the end of the semester, I know I speak for all when I say Aaron was a great professor (straight 5's from most of us).  Every workshop started off with us going around and saying what we liked about the piece before we moved on to what we thought the author could work on.  Aaron also put in the effort to come up with writing exercises geared towards increasing the amount of time we write every week and getting past writer's block. Each class also had an informal title of Setting, Character, Plot, etc., which really made sure we covered multiple aspects of the writing process by the end of the semester.  He was always open to read additional drafts, to offer advice and to share his personal experiences.  He is also an AMAZING baker and brings a bunch of treats to class.  Having taken other writing classes at Columbia, this was by far the fairest and most enjoyable experience thus far.  He really challenges you to look at your characters and your work from a new perspective, but then he understands if you don't take his advice.  \nWorkload:\nTwo short stories. Weekly mini assignments (some optional). Class participation and attendance are a must! \n"

            "review_content": "\nAlright, so I went into this class expecting a terrible professor and got a mediocre one. Seems like he's taken into account that he was a little too pretentious and closed-minded, but the problems are still there, though bearable. He still asks students to submit questions about being a writer and then gives some general responses.\nHe comes off as ignorant to modern literature, seeing as he shoots down most stories that have more abstract or modern approaches. He wants everything to be simple \"tell me a story about a person that is totally clear.\" He wants people to write for the simplest audience that is imaginable--having taken a seminar class at the same time as this, I think he would probably have hated 75% of the modern work we were reading because he'd find it too \"vague.\" I don't feel any doubt in saying that if any student took all of his advice at face value, they'd stifle everything that might make them successful in the future.\nWhile he has some valid things to say about making stories about characters and making narrative more active, those comments are very general, and then when he gives specific advice, it's often to the detriment of the author's purpose. He just doesn't get authorial intent.\nThe class is valuable for the peer critiques, as people in class are more often going to understand what you set out to do far better than he does. There are large swaths of modern culture and society that he's so ignorant to that he can't connect to your story at all if it doesn't have a strong character. However, first drafts often are going to be weak in character, and this is the most common and meaningful critique he gave most of the time, so what he often ends up doing is burning down the authorial intent of the story (making the students insecure about their entire premise) and wanting it watered down to being all about character.\nBasically, while his advice is technically correct a lot of the time, the trouble he has connecting to and understanding the work of the students makes it so that this advice is not as useful as he thinks, since he's often basically telling the students that their entire idea isn't worth writing about. I say this based off of the comments he gives in class, not just those I received. Often a couple students would disagree with what he was saying and feel like they understood the purpose of the work.\nIf he were to improve, I'd like to see him more removed from the discussion and just keep more of his ideas to himself or to the paper. He sticks his hands in the critiques far too often with comments that can come off as deriding to the author's intent because he's unable to connect to their work, and if he wants to be liked by the students then he should just guide the discussion and keep his opinions out of it--I don't see him ever being able to connect with different types of literature than those he's interested in. He basically wants every story to be able to cater to his own way of reading, and so if it doesn't work for him, it doesn't work.\nWorkload:\ntwo stories, weekly critiques of three student stories, weekly readings and creative assignments, and a final portfolio of the two revised story and one revised assignment\n"

His \"lectures\" and/or \"exercises\" do little to help your writing and, when workshops begin, he becomes disorganized and his comments (if they are legible) are basic kinds of things that any close reader would pick out.  Furthermore, when you have your private conferences with him about your piece, he tells you where he \"sees this piece going\" and tries to suggest that you write it a certain way - his way. If you don't, your grade will suffer.\nPerhaps the most disturbing thing was his widely mentioned homework assignment where he called for us to ask him questions about his writing career.  When one card asked him \"why [he] teach[es]\" his first response was, \"writing doesn't pay all that well and I need a way to make money\" and, then, \"I feel I'm a prophet and have something valuable to share.\"\nBear in mind this review is not coming from a student who received a poor grade and was disgruntled with the class.  I received a strong grade, though not an A. \nPlease, stay way from this man and, maybe, he'll eventually leave Columbia.\nWorkload:\nNothing too intense.

I think this little anecdote sums him up best:\nTo try to \"liven up\" the class a little bit, he taped up a\npiece of paper on the wall-- titled the \"Word\nHall of Fame.\" Aaron would arbitrarily pick a word- such as PERFECT or MYRIAD, say something like-- \"what is truly perfect, anyway?\" write it into the Retirement Home,\nand declare that we were not allowed to use that word in our writing. Besides that, Aaron seemed to have barely skimmed over everyone's work before reviewing it (which was evident\nin the fact that he constantly misquoted people's work, was extremely egocentric, would take up class time talking about his many successful readings, reviews, etc and generally just didn't want to be there.\nWorkload:\nweekly reviews of your classmates' work, 2 poems, 1 scene, 1 short story, final portfolio\n"

News flash, Aaron: we *know* you're an accomplished writer -- the class isn't about you! \nWhat I disliked the most was the way he would go about critiques without saying anything nice about a student's work.  Of course in an intro creative writing class we're not (typically) going to have works of genius, but I found his disregard for the term \"constructive criticism\" to be very self-serving.\n Even if he liked a piece, the most you could get out of him was a, \"this metaphor was good\" -- or something like, \"this reminds me of my own excellent use of dialogue\" -- because come now, this class isn't actually about the students, it's Aaron's own support group, manipulated to make him feel good about himself.\n\n"

Once we were doing sentence writing exercises.  He told everyone to pick their favorite and read it out loud.  When it came to his turn, he said \u00c2\u201cOh, they\u00c2\u2019re all so good,\u00c2\u201d (giggle), \u00c2\u201cI\u00c2\u2019m going to invoke my right as a teacher to read two, because I can\u00c2\u2019t decide.\u00c2\u201d  (note, this is not verbatim, but it is the general jist... and the giggle was certainly there).  Ahh, the modesty.  If this is what writers are like, I fear becoming one.  Furthermore, He wants you to write a certain way and if you don\u00c2\u2019t, he gets upset and passive aggressively gets back at you during your critique.  For In the poetry section, you had to be crystal clear \u00c2\u2013 and explain everything\u00c2\u2026 no obscure poems.  Blake, Pound, and Yeats would probably not have succeeded in this class \u00c2\u2013 but I guess they are not good writers.  All the writing he used as examples is artful and pretentious, which is writing I don\u00c2\u2019t like \u00c2\u2013 so it was hard to stomach it.  He comes across as a wimpy, whiny, full of himself kind of guy \u00c2\u2013 he\u00c2\u2019s ENORMOUSLY passive aggressive, and will suffocate your writing.

I completely agree with the previous reviewers about Aaron's inability to inspire his students and his unfortunate preoccupation with none other than himself (and his own writing and literary tastes). You would think the cliche of 'the writing teacher who doesn't like your writing and just doesn't give you a good grade' would be obliterated in a Columbia creative writing class... that is very far from the case with Aaron. There were no criteria for grading and assessment, and the class became a bizzare free-for-all, in which Aaron served as a somewhat random dictator of 'word choice' and literary taste.  Also, you will never know what grade you are getting in this class, and he will spring it on you in the end. He will say things such as, \"The grades really don't matter... what matters is you as a writer\" and \"It is not a judgment of you but of what is in your portfolio.\" As you and I both know, such statements are sickeningly contrived, and only leave students guessing at what the teacher does and does not like. The only saving grace in the class was the students. The students were often very insightful, and the majority of the student comments on drafts completely disagreed with Aaron's somewhat sparse remarks. Overall, I'd say this class is more apt to make you dislike the writing program than continue with it. Steer clear. \nWorkload:\n2 poems, 1 scene, 1 short story.
