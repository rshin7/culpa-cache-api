Marcellus made economics so interesting by relating the numbers and principles to real-life problems, including some of his own experiences. I am an Econ major, and know Econ classes can be dry (see Math Methods for Economics), but this has been the most interesting class I have taken at Barnard by far. If you pay attention in lecture and take good notes, there is no reason to have difficulty with the midterms or final.\nWorkload:\nSeveral books\nOptional Problem Sets\n2 Midterms, lowest dropped\nFinal Exam\n\n"

He has such a passion for economics, and it rubs off on everyone who takes his class. He does such a great job of reviewing the material. While basic microeconomics can get a little dry, Marcellus used examples to keep the class engaged. Like the previous reviews have stated, Marcellus has been going through a tough couple months. However, his teaching, I felt, never suffered because of it. He really does care about his students and made an effort to get to know everyone before the end of the semester.\nOverall, Marcellus is one of the best professors I have had at Columbia/Barnard. He is the professor who convinced me to become an Econ major. Please take his class. You will not regret it. \nWorkload:\nNot a lot. Just keep up with the readings and you will be fine. Two midterms, one of which you are allowed to drop. However, the final is what really counts. Many times, Marcellus has told his classes that there have been people who have failed both midterms and have gotten A's in the class because of the final. \n"

He really does love to teach and don't be intimidated by him - he is helpful if you me with him and he likes when his students ask (thoughtful) questions. He wasn't at his best last semester, but as other reviewers have stated, he had an extremely tough few months. He is a really wonderful teacher- he is engaging, a good teacher, and for the most part, a relatively fair grader. He says there aren't any curves, but he curved all three of our tests. My one problem with him was that he was pretty unavailable, although, again, I think it really has a lot to do with his circumstances last semester. Anyway, take this course! \nWorkload:\nNot too bad. Just keep up with the readings and study for the midterms and final - both of which were pretty fair\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis is a GREAT class. Prof. Andrews is a great professor who really cares about his students unlike some other professors I had this past semester. \nHe wants to know all of his students (and that is why he often \"complained\" about the class size) - he wanted to be able to hear everyone - which is certainly very tough to do when you have 100+ class (eventually it shrank, but still was not a seminar type class)\nOne thing that I found many students complained about was the non-clearenes of the assignments, but this was changed  - only b/c professor Andrews really cared about our progress and asked the class what was wrong (the first midterm was not that great on average while 2nd midterm was much better).\nOverall, professor Andrews is a caring professor. Sure, he has his own point of view (as we all do), but he never let that affect the judgment of the exams.\n\nOne thing that would definitely make the course more exciting is attendance of his OH. He is amazing at supporting conversation and helping out during the OH - that is when he has more time to get to know you and to really understand what is the missing part that makes you struggle. \nMoreover, professor helped me with my other class by providing me with the list of readings and by talking to me about the topic. So he was a true professor for me not only for MB class but for my other course as well. My conclusion is that if you want this class to be amazing, it only depends on you. If you have the desire to learn, professor Andrews will provide you with all the necessary tools. He will contribute to your knowledge 100%.\nHaving said that, I STRONGLY recommend attending his OH.\nFinally, I was shocked to hear that prof. Andrews was not given the tenure. It is said to see such a great professor to leave CU.\n\nWorkload:\n2 Midterms (dropped the lowest) \n1 Final \nBooks are a great source of understanding the material although you don't really need to know them to get A.\nhw - easy\n"

He also cares about his students so definitely go to his office hours and talk to him if you're feeling lost or have a question.\nHis tests are reasonable. The first may have been too technical and he realized that, so the second was purely short answer and very conceptual. The final was also very focused on basic concepts -- the course is all about basics, which he constantly repeats. He also stresses that he only cares about what you know at the end of the course, which means you can make up for poor past performance on the final.\nIt saddens me to hear that a professor like Marcellus is not getting tenure. Yes, this semester's class may have been a little hectic due to (1) the class being oversubscribed past the point he was comfortable and (2) him having personal issues, including being diagnosed with cancer again. He's not a perfect human, but he is always the first one to admit his flaws and apologize to for letting his personal life interfere with the class. He clearly cares a lot about his students and is very dedicated to running a high-quality course. That's more than you can say for the majority of professors. \n\nWorkload:\n5 HWs (last ended up being optional)\n2 Midterms (dropped the lowest)\n1 Final \nA bunch of books assigned to read, but really not required.\n"

A few weeks into the course, he was the victim of an attempted mugging at gun point. A week after that his home in NJ was out of power for a week and his young son had to be cared for because his school was closed. Yeah...try to have that NOT affect your performance as a lecturer. \nDespite all that, he's being doing a FANTASTIC job. He saves a lot of the math for exercises, but he (really) only cares that you understand the subtle and complex links that underlie today's complex financial system, many of which were at the heart of the recent financial crisis. An understanding of those links, combined with an understanding of how they affect and are affected by risk, are really at the heart of this class. If you care about those issues, Andrews is a professor you will be interested in. \nPeople seem to be a little intimidated by him...which I don't really understand. In fact, he seems to actually care quite a bit about his students. Admittedly, he tried to scare some of them away (which he acknowledged), but that seems to have worked. Next time, when he caps the course, that won't be an issue. \nAll in all, a great class. \nWorkload:\n5 HWs (drops lowest)\n2 midterms\n1 final\n"

            "review_content": "\nMarcellus's lectures allowed a lot of insight. He goes from the basic economic models and brings them into 3-d by introducing real world applications of economics. He is also a wonderful speaker and very engaging, but there are a few issues i would like to present\nFirstly, i would suggest this class to people who have a high understanding of economics or have already taken an economics course such as AP economics in high school. He does not do such a good job at explaining basic economic theories. His lectures consist mostly of applications of basic economics in the real world or bringing the most basic models to the next level. If i did not take ap economics in high school, i would have been totally lost in the class. \nSecond, i did not enjoy the random comments he made in class which were sometimes inappropriate and seemed like self-pity. Throughout the semester he went on about how \"ugly\" he was and sometimes vocalized the disadvantages of african americans in society such as himself. Not that these comments really bothered me, they were just inappropriate since it did not relate to anything we were talking about in class and were rather distracting. \nThird, his tests were really unconventional and unexpected. Sometimes he says there are multiple choices but there aren't (well maybe they are in a way but not the sort you'd expect) The final was a killer. There were people who started crying. I'm not sure if his past tests were like that but this last test left some people feeling helpless. If you couldn't answer the first question, then it was really hard to answer the rest of the questions because the question after would depend on your answer to the question before. So the whole test was basically on one diagram and it depended on whether you could answer the first question or not. \nLastly, his lectures were really disorganized. It was hard to take notes. He would talk about one thing then go onto another and go back to the first thing. If you take the class you would have to retake the notes during your free time in order for them to be coherent. \nTherefore, i would recommend this class to people who have already taken an economics course in high school to understand and appreciate his expansions upon those basic ideas. His class was very very insightful and i enjoyed it. But i think i was only able to enjoy it because i understood the most basic concepts. I would have been completely lost and sometimes still was even though i knew the most basic concepts. In order to learn the basic concepts you have to read the textbook which he doesn't really draw from in class. \nWorkload:\nnot so bad. three midterms (one dropped) and a final. all exams are curved. readings from the textbooks are about 15-25 pages each chapter. You get about one chapter or so a week. \n"

Anyways, I'm super glad I took Prof. Andrews class instead. Very light reading and work (all problem sets were optional, though you should do them to prep yourself for the exams), and his lectures were very engaging. He's extremely left wing, but I think he's pretty good at separating the theory from his own bias, and does give the right credit where its due. That being said, his exams are killer, though he grades them on a curve like any other class, so if you know how to think through the ideas behind the questions, you can do quite well. Just use supply/demand.  Anyways, great last class at Columbia. Anyone who wants to do econ for fun should take this instead of the more boring/tougher Columbia ones.\nWorkload:\n3 midterms (one dropped), final exam\u00e2\u20ac\u201dall pretty challenging. textbook reading (regurgitation of class) and one other more politically inclined book\n"

He is extremely knowledgeable about basically anything relating to  economics and social justice.  He manages to command your respect while being very approachable.  The texts that we covered were very useful in discussion (even though they were sometimes poorly-written).  He has a great sense of humor, too, which is often self-deprecating.  He keeps it pretty real, often using coarse language to get a point across.  But we're all big kids now, so this shouldn't be problem.\nThe only part of the course that sniffed turds was a few of the other students. Because he's such an engaging lecturer there are those students who always have something to say, but when they speak they manage to say nothing at all.  Andrews does do a good job of redirecting the class in these situations, and does so somehow with out belittling the classmates that like the sound of their own voice.\nWorkload:\nTotally manageable.  There are a lot of required readings, but they are often summarized by Andrews himself.  The key to a good grade is participating and asking difficult questions, having command of the texts, and writing strong essays.

He likes to make self-deprecating jokes about how you shouldn't listen to him because he is just a black man, and how his wife is too good to love him.  Then he would waste twenty minutes telling us all about his impending divorce.  \nHis office hours are a mockery; he will tell you the answers to the homework questions and then make fun of you, which isn't that bad until you get to the tests and realize you don't understand how to do the problems.  More often than not he would cancel his office hours or change the times at the last minute because of personal problems, which he will tell you all about in class.\nTo his credit, he does a fair job at making the course material interesting and will try to make understandable analyses of current economic events.  However he spent so much time philosophizing about how economists are inherently angry people and telling us there will be no jobs for us when we graduate, that he didn't end up spending a whole lot of time teaching. \nI would avoid Professor Andrews at all costs until he gets his undoubtedly complicatedly personal life in order and is ready to come to class with a lesson plan and actually hold his office hours.\nWorkload:\nTwo midterms, a final (both multiple choice) and a variable number of homeworks, as he does not view his syllabus as binding.
