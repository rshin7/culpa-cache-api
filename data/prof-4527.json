She goes by her first name, and that's okay, but she also teaches at NYU Gallatin, and you can really tell that she cares a lot more about her class over there. She is okay, but you really can't hear a single thing that she says throughout the entire semester. She's not the absolute worst, but she definitely ruined my first semester at Barnard.\nWorkload:\n2 essays and 1 research paper at the end of the semester; daily readings for every class, usually not too bad, but sometimes a bit overboard for one night\n"
