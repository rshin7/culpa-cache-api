            "review_content": "\nDr. Kehoe is just fantastic. I had her for Art Hum, and she made Art History one of my favorite topics to study. She is HILARIOUS, engaging, knowledgeable, approachable and amazing. She has a great sense of humor, which she incorporates into her lectures. Out of all of the core classes I have taken, I can recall the most information from Dr. Kehoe's class because of how memorable her lectures are. This was one of the few classes I regularly wished would last longer, each session. LOVE HER and take her if you have the chance. \nPROS: \n- trips to the Met & St. John's Cathedral\n- everything about Dr. Kehoe\n- the class discussions: it seemed like almost everyone participated because they wanted to\n- the workload: very manageable\n- the readings!!: very carefully selected; reasonable; no busywork\n- the first paper: to analyze one of the buildings on campus; fun to do \n- doesn't expect you to memorize a billion dates and names of paintings - only the few you write on for the exams\nCONS: \n- ... classes too short? Seriously, our entire class adored Dr. Kehoe, and I can't think of a single negative about the class \n- She might be leaving Columbia after her postdoctoral fellowship \n\nWorkload:\n2 papers (4-5 pages, 6-8 pages) \n1 midterm (comparisons between paintings, essay portion) \n1 final (comparisons between paintings, 2 essays) \n\n"
