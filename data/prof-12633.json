            "review_content": "\nSeth is a really smart person and a really good professor. He will take the time to read your essays thoroughly and cares (sometimes more than students care) about helping students become better writers and thinkers. He asks challenging and interesting questions in class. One of the best things about having Seth as a Prof is visiting his office hours. He takes time to talk through writing ideas, will \"hash out\" books with you outside of class, has interesting life advice, and is interesting to talk with. Some people thought his class time could get boring and his grading was too harsh but I disagree. I would take his section again in a heart beat. He deserves gold. Plus he lets you call him Seth which is cool. Also you get to know your class well and he takes y'all out for dinner instead of doing academic extracurriculars like the other sections of LH.\nWorkload:\nPut a lot of work into your essays and expect to think hard about your writing style and edit edit edit well and edit again. Go to talk to him at office hours. Come to class sincerely prepared. Other than doing the readings and writing good essays (only roughly 2 per semester) not much work.\n"

            "review_content": "\nCongratulations! You were randomly placed into Professor Kimmel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s section of Literature Humanities. Please, call him Seth. My advice is to stay. Why? Cause I liked the class and think you will too. \nSeth is certainly not the lecture-at-you-professor, telling the class everything you \"need\" to know about each book that you read. Instead, he spends roughly half the amount of time we speed on each book (so about a day) listening to what the class thinks is important. Then, he spends the other half of the time pushing us towards what he finds important in each text. He is rarely interested by such things as Shakespeare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renowned knack for inventing words or the definitions of terms such as kleos, hamartia, and ubermensch. Seth makes the class think about what these texts mean now. He lead us to ponder Montaigne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pursuit of a universal system of judgment and Cervantes simultaneous warning against and defense of ideals. \nThese are Question!\nYou will not necessarily come away from this class feeling that you know more about \"literature\" in the scholarly sense, but I feel that I came away from this class knowing for the first time how to successfully read a text, how to critically reflect on it, and how to write a thoughtful and meaningful analysis of it. Seth emphasizes close reading, and originality of thought. He places a greater emphasis on the philosophy aspect of western literature than the literature aspect of it.\nBut, even I (anonymous voice on the internet) did not always think it would be this way. I wanted a Lit Hum class where my professor would tell me all the answers: what this book means, how it answers the problems that it raises. Professor Kimmel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s class is the antithesis of the class I envisioned being in, but after a year, I am glad to have taken it and would definitely take it again.\nApart from being a great teacher, Seth is pretty cool dude. Get to know him! \nNow that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve convinced you to stay in the class, here is a survival guide:\nSeth does not seem to like: verbosity, long-windedness, redundancy: Both in writing and especially in speaking in class. This is not to say that he is impatient, but he does quiet repeat offenders efficiently. He also does enjoy silence in class.\nSeth does seem to like: words such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tension, pedagogy, epistemological\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, sharing good places to eat in Manhattan and the other boroughs, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concision and originality of thought.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nAnd please, read the books. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say it is the one thing you really need to do to do well in his class. Seth would add, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turning in your papers on time is all you have to do to become a Harvard professor.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\nWorkload:\nSemester 1: 3 papers: the first one (5%) teaches you how to write (it really works, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an amazing writer, see), the other two are more serious (spend a weekend on them not a night) and worth 15% and 20% (in order). Posts online/class participation: one post per book and 5 comments on other posts per semester, and hopefully speaking more than once per class: 20%. Midterm and Final are each 20%.\nSemester 2: 2 papers 20% each with peer edits on a draft due a week before the final draft that are 5% each. Midterm and Final are 15% each. 10% for participation: 5 posts online for the semester and lots of talking in class. 10% for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153presentation\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\nDo all the reading!\n"

            "review_content": "\nSeth is a good teacher for lit hum. I wouldn't call him great (if he made some small changes, I think he'd be perfect) but as it stands, this class was good and I would take it again. Don't get me wrong. The class seems a lot more enjoyable than other sections that my friends took, where the teacher drones on and the class is constantly behind. But that's not to say that it was perfect for me. \nThe best part about this class was the emphasis on discussion. I know some of you will hate that. Some people like to listen to someone drone on about metric economy or whatever you talk about in each book. I personally found it much more enjoyable to have a teacher that emphasized class discussions, even if it did come down to only a few of us actually having this discussion. But really being able to get a sense of ideas and where people stand on issues was really, really helpful when it came time to write my essays. Though there were some painful moments, Seth did try to really to keep the discussion lively. \nHowever, there are some times where I felt that Seth could be a better teacher. Often, I felt that his expectations for essays were too high. I understand that this is Columbia and it should be difficult -- but he was never clear from the beginning about what he wanted to see/did not want to see, and expected you to figure it out more or less through the semester. His comments were sometimes very precise (especially the ones regarding style, which I will comment on more later) but other times were very, very, very vague. He once wrote that I had a \"good style\" and left it at that. It was difficult for me to determine what made my style good in particular, and what he liked to see. \nThat's not to say the comments were entirely useless. Often he'd point out stylistic or organizational flaws, particularly passive voice (seriously, just avoid it at all costs -- even constructions like \"X is characterized as Y by use of ...\" WILL be noted) padding (use of phrases like \"also,\" \"similarly,\" \"in other words,\" etc.) or adverbs (he doesn't seem to mind these as much, though). By the end of the class I was not sure what made my writing good, but rather what made it bad and what I should avoid. That's something, I guess, but I'd rather know what to focus on improving and making shine rather than what to remove entirely. \nAnother notable aspect where I think there could be some room for improvement is knowing who wants to participate. I know I said he does a great job at getting people to participate, and I still hold by this. He achieves this mostly by getting out of the way and directing people to talk not to him, but to one another. However, that's not to say that *everyone* participates in these discussions, or even that everyone should. As we all know, not everyone does the reading or even reads the SparkNotes. But Seth still expects everyone to participate -- which I think is a fine expectation, but in reality, I'd rather he not call on people obviously not prepared and have the class sit in utter silence for (literally) thirty seconds to one minute. Honestly, I did not feel embarrassed for that person, but I felt embarrassed that they were put on display in the first place. \nI also felt that some of his behaviors in class were rude or downright unprofessional. Once, he interrupted a student to ask another to stop snapping in support. Regardless of what you think about snapping, it would have been much more professional to send that student an email or talk to them during break or something else -- stopping a student entirely to reprimand another in front of the whole class not only disrespected the student he interrupted but also everyone who was listening to her. In addition, he also commented that Ovid \"raped\" Homer and Virgil by adapting their stories, a comment which I will leave to stand for itself.\nThat being said, don't think I hate Seth or even dislike him. He is a very talented teacher (seriously, look him up. He speaks like four languages and got tons of honors) but he isn't without flaws. He took Lit Hum as a freshman, too, so he knows what it's like and tries to space out the reading to be easier for the class (i.e. most of a book will be assigned over a weekend). I also liked his class for his laid back personality, vibrant discussions and his office hours. Speaking of, seriously go to office hours. He is super helpful and will schedule additional office hours if his don't work for you, even if you just want to talk about essay ideas! Since he is grading your essay, definitely ask him as he will help you choose the best idea and develop it a bit. He will also have good restaurant suggestions (I've noticed a lot of them are in Brooklyn), though they may be lost on first years as they need a dining plan. \nOh, he also lets you use laptops in class AND has a break in the middle :) Which you may or may not enjoy. Personally I didn't mind it as most people took notes by pen and paper and those on computer generally paid attention. The breaks were always welcome though. \nAll in all, if you get Seth Kimmel as your Lit Hum teacher, you probably lucked out. While he may not be perfect, I think he is one of the best instructors and you will probably not regret staying in his class. \nWorkload:\nTypical Lit Hum course load. He stays very true to the syllabus, never adding or removing any extra days for any book (which can be a good or bad thing). He requires online discussion on CourseWorks, which can be a good place to look for essays. Second semester I felt was much easier than the first. \nAll essays are close readings. \nFirst semester: \n- Short paper (5%, 2pgs)\n- Two long papers (15% and 20% respectively, 5 to 6 pages). There are no drafts for these. \n- Midterm (20%, basically a shorter version of the final)\n- Final (20%, standard Lit Hum final without any changes)\n- Participation (20%, both in class and on CourseWorks) CourseWorks participation first semester involved posting a discussion topic every week (usually about 200 words or so) and five responses to other discussion topics throughout the semester. \nSecond semester: \n- Two papers (20% each, 6 to 7 pages). You turn in a draft about 10 days before the final paper is due, which is then edited by a peer.\n- Peer editing comments (5% each) This is basically a gift for your grade. You just fill out a sheet and make some edits to your peer editor's essay. Graded from check to check++ (though I don't think it impacts the score you get for this part)\n- Midterm (15%, shorter version of the Lit Hum final)\n- Final (15%, standard Lit Hum final without any changes)\n- Participation (10%, both in class and on CourseWorks). Second semester it was very different. You would pick a text at the beginning of the year and you were responsible to \"curate\" the discussion, which entailed posting a longer topic for discussion and actively checking up on it. A lot easier as you don't have to come up with a topic every book. Like last semester, though, you're expected to post five different responses to other's posts, though they may not all be on the same book. \n- Oral presentation (10%) Basically discussion leading for 50 or so minutes. You also pick this text at the beginning of the semester, and you present in pairs (sometimes groups of three). This is much easier than it sounds, and odds are you'll run out time before you run out of things to talk about. It can be hard to get people to participate in your discussion but Seth will jump in and sternly ask people to answer questions you raise. This is graded credit/no credit, so don't worry too much about quality. \n"

He's little tough on the grading and doesn't always seem forthcoming about his criteria, but he's very good at encouraging meaningful and deep discussion in Lit Hum. He's a very nice guy, and you can always feel comfortable going to his office hours or just chatting with him after class. He's also pretty understanding about the stress that students feel at certain points in the semester but continues to expect that all the readings have been done. \nWorkload:\nThe average for a Lit Hum class\n"

            "review_content": "\nSeth, or SK, currently teaches LitHum. He is honestly a really great teacher and facilitates the class really well. As a class mostly of first-years he really helps you bond and at least in our experience we actually became a really solid group of friends. He is a very likable guy and easily becomes more of a friend than an instructor. He's pretty flexible with how far you get in the readings and is willing to fill gaps in the conversation and spark new topics of interest. If you get Seth for LitHum you are one lucky son of a gun. You won't regret staying in his class and maybe even some of his coolness will rub off on you. \n\nWorkload:\nA couple of papers each semester, then core-wide midterms and finals. Flexible with readings, never assigns a whole book over one weekend, etc.\n"
