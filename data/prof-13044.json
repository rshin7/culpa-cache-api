Class was pretty engaging, and he knew a lot of interesting tidbits about the works of art. If you get him, don't switch out!\nWorkload was fairly light and the grading was pretty easy.\nWorkload:\nFour 3-page papers. Thesis driven; you can write about anything you want pertaining to the material.\nMidterm- IDs, comparisons, and essay. Not difficult if you studied.\n1 take-home final- comparisons between works of art.\nPretty easy/fair grading overall.\n\n"
