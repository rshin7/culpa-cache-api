The readings were entirely too long (think 100-200 pages of reading a week), and most of the time while I was reading them I was wondering how they would ever possibly be relevant to my studies. \nIt only focuses on the Mediterranean, fyi. \nBesides the reading, the workload is light, three responses, one big (12-15 page) paper. No exams.\nTake it if you care passionately about the Mediterranean for some reason. Skip it otherwise.\nWorkload:\nThe workload is light, three responses, one big (12-15 page) paper. No exams.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Dobie was the first French teacher I had at Columbia and from what I have come to understand since then, she is very reflective of the entire department. She is very French and if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite know what that means, it might be later than sooner that you find out. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice, but more like polite than warmhearted. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledgeable, but will not exhibit any visible passion for the subject material. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy going, as in she tolerates blatantly bad accents and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flexible about dates and assignments. Overall, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blas\u00c3\u00a9 (...does one add an E in English?) about the class and life in general. She was often late to class yet had that easiness about her attitude and even wardrobe that is just. so. French. The class on the other hand, at least for me, was fascinating. Professor Dobie mainly lectures, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking to brush up your speaking and grammar, go elsewhere. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basically a history class. Simple as that. You must be able to understand French perfectly and write fast, because she talks for 74 of the 75 minutes. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not particularly engaging, but the texts are still worthwhile. Another word of advice: this class deals primarily with France and political, historical and social developments therein. The follow-up course (Francophone Studies Part II) is ENTIRELY about French colonies (read: AFRICA). They do not have to be taken subsequently but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advisable.\n\nWorkload:\nVery manageable: midterm, final, and 2 or 3 brief essays (really more like responses).\n"

            "review_content": "\nPros:\nMadeleine Dobie will look after you: she takes OH seriously, and schedules appointments without any humming and hawing. She gives solid advice to those who enquire before writing  a paper, and follows up afterwards with every student, by default\nShe is extremely well-read in all aspects this particular course, does not limit herself to literature (and includes history, political science, social philosophy, etc. etc.), and shows none of the wishy-washy naivet\u00c3\u00a9 of the typical CCLS scholar. You will learn the subject inside out, from two centuries of immigration, to post-colonialism, to youth culture, to the riots of 2005.\nMadeleine will let your research just about anything you want, within or without her areas of expertise: she grades on the argument, use of material from class in testing assumptions, and, it seems, thoroughness and originality. \nHer opinions are strong, but her prejudice is not.\nYou will be taking this class in French. This is not a negative, in that Madeleine will not mark you off on your papers for misemployment of the language, as long as your argument is intelligible. This is a plus in that she will mark every error she can find and explain to you how you can improve your writing.\nMadeleine Dobie is the director of undergraduate studies in the French and Romance Philology department (on leave now, but generally this is so) and has some significant ties with CCLS. She is always looking out for job opportunities to pass on, too. Few faculty members would be more useful to know.\nCons:\nIf you read poorly in French, you will be in trouble. \nW3505's readings outnumbered my CC readings at least three to two, page for page. Not doing the readings is not much of an option, as class participation is a huge part of the assessment.\nWhile you could read a few pages and think about them really hard, you won't be able to bullshit a point without stepping in it: the texts you will be reading\u00c2\u2014novels, complex theories, and convoluted histories\u00c2\u2014resist skimming. \nAs most Columbia students of French aren't fluent French speakers, this course is structured around a lecture. Dobie fosters enough participation to keep the room awake, but not enough to bring about a full-blown discussion.\nIf independent research isn't your bag, you're out of luck: the two papers you'll be writing use the contents of that collosal reading list as a jumping-off point; the papers range over new material.\nWorkload:\n100-250p/week, almost exclusively in French, with a mix of literary, argotic, academic, and academic-obtuse registers. Two research papers, 8-10p, in French.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis is a rewarding course to take if you're looking to satisfy half the Major Cultures requirement or to get some credits for Comparative Literature and Society. That it falls under List A (meaning it works for Major Cultures but has no pre-requisites and can be taken in addition to ANY other List A course) is another definite plus. Professor Dobie is an excellent, rather hard-core professor. Her TA this year was very nice and graded quite fairly. (Professor Dobie grades your exams and one of your essays, and the TA grades your other essay.  At least that's how it was this year.) The material is interesting, the syllabus is meticulously assembled (or so it appeared), and the lectures are informative (although sometimes scattered and rarely linear). My only complaint is that the material was not always presented chronologically, since the course dealt with so many regions and histories. You'll probably find \"Islam and Europe\" interesting if you like postcolonial studies. Other topics covered in depth are Spanish history (Andalusia/Al-Andalus), Islam (although Professor Dobie doesn't go in depth into doctrine), the Crusades, and immigration issues in modern Europe. You read very interesting material. I recommend this class especially to people interested in literature, since you'll learn a wealth of surprising information about Arabic and Islamic influences on canonical \"Western\" classics, even some Christian texts. The class, I think, prepares one well for the political climate of humanities courses at Columbia. That's not to say that Professor Dobie is any kind of political crusader - just the opposite; she welcomes diversity in class discussions - it's just that she thoroughly introduces you to a bunch of topics that will probably come up in other humanities courses. But I'm just speaking from my own experiences.\nWorkload:\nTons of readings from various genres - political, academic, polemical, philosophical, poetry, fiction, Shakespeare - MOST of it is good reading. Two papers with the prescribed length of 3-4 pages (although I think a lot of people wrote a lot more, and we were sort of on our own for topics). Very fact-based (meaning difficult, almost but not quite unreasonably) midterm and final. Professor Dobie is a fair but arguably tough grader.   \n"

The class is a mix of lecture and discussion, although a few people would just speak for eternity.\nThe impression I got from Dobie is that she is a true scholar: very careful with the words she uses and very meticulous with her selection of reading to try to enable us to learn as much as possible.  She has a witty sense of humor and good interaction with students.  She actually put in the effort of learning everyone's name!  She's also very approachable outside of class.  \nA great class to take for fun and for the major cultures requirement.  If an engineering student like me could say this about a humanities class, that speaks volumes =P\nWorkload:\nLots of reading, two 3-4pg papers, a midterm and final that are quite factual-based.

However she lacks personal charme which is reflected in her lecture style..The class is interesting and  taught entirely in French. I took it as a preparation for Reid Hall in Paris and it was a great combination of subject and language study. If you have any interest in cultures this is definitely a good course to take as it looks at many interesting theories and all in French. But i wouldnt say it was THE CLASS to take..an A is possible but only if your French is up to it..\nWorkload:\n2 papers in French about 5 pages (interesting topics, challenges your writing and thinking in French) midterm and final require memorization of dates etc. can be a bit annoying, but doable\n"

I had already taken a class on European history 250-1050 and CC, and there was quite a bit of overlap with both.  Most of the class time is lecture, but from time to time she will make it a discussion.  This happens most often towards the end of the semester, so try to keep up on the reading then.\nThe course focuses on where Islam and European culture meet, so you spend most of the semester on Andalusian Spain and British and French colonies in the Middle East and North Africa.\nThe course was really interesting and Professor Dobie knows the material inside and out.  The reading load is heavier than most major cultures courses, but if you've ever taken a history or literature course and done most of the reading, you'll manage fine.\nIf you ever miss a class, send Prof. Dobie a nice email and she'll send you her lecture notes.  Beware, they're looong.  My class shared our copies of her notes, so we pretty much had the semester covered.\nA note of caution:  Prof. Dobie has been studying Islam for a while and from a European perspective.  If you hold views that are outside the mainstream, be prepared to defend them, especially in your papers.  That being said, she won't argue with you in class, so leave your soapbox at home.\nWorkload:\ntwo papers (with possible rewrites), midterm and final\n"

She's also the undergrade dept advisor and someone with EXTENSIVE background in F&F; Studies, so she's a great person to get to know if you have a real interest in the subject. \nAs a professsor, however, Dobie's class was pretty dry; she wasn't great at provoking conversation, and most of the class was a Q&A; type session, where she asked a question and class time was spent trying to direct students to the exact answer she had in mind, rather than discuss topics/issues raised in the readings. Nonetheless, it is a an interesting subject and definitely throught-provoking, even if much of that \"thought\" won't get expressed in class.\nWorkload:\nDefinitely very doable. 2 papers with rewrites(first on an assigned topic, second you come up with the topic), in class midterm/final.
