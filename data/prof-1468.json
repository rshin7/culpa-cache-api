Seriously, she will help you with everything in both lab and lecture, schedule outside time to go over things with you, loan you books to help, find you other TAs to talk to if your question isn't in her field of expertise, and bring you candy on Halloween!  And she doesn't get mad when your class breaks a gazillion mercury thermometers.  Millie is a very kind grader, but mostly just works really hard to make sure you understand everything so she doesn't have to take points off.  Transfer into her section as fast as possible!\nWorkload:\nIt's lab, you can't get out of the 10 labs, quizzes, write ups and the final.  But with Millie, you'll emerge happier.\n"
