He had the ability of connecting personally with his students all the while maintaining his role as the teacher. Our class was always well-structured and I felt I learned more about writing in this one semester than I had in my entire high school career. Even if you already have mastered what the writing center wants you to learn (using a lens, conversation, etc.), Chris pushes you to find ways of making your writing grow. Chris understands when you are swamped with other midterms, finals and such and is willing under certain circumstances to grant extensions.\nFrom everything I've heard, I was very lucky to have taken his class. Best teacher I had last semester hands down.\nWorkload:\n4 major papers/\"progressions\". In each \"progression\" we had 2-3 drafts, complete with peer-editing. We had to turn in a small (less than a page) writing assignment almost every class. HEAVY reading, for a writing class, but it helps your writing in the end.\n"
