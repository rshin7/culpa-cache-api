            "review_content": "\nThis is a fun class. Small, self-selecting, and fairly niche, as would be expected from a seminar with reading knowledge of Anglo Saxon as a prerequisite. And while translation is the major component of the workload, the class itself is more for discussion and literary analysis than for the technical aspects of language and translation, so the more solid your own foundation in OE, the better, though Prof. Dailey will give you tons and tons of language resources to help.\nWorkload is manageable and negotiable. The grading is pretty easy. I feel like as long as you come off as more or less competent, Dailey will give you the benefit of the doubt and grade you well. \nWorkload:\nWeekly translations/discussion posts on 2ndary readings\u00e2\u20ac\u201d40%\n5-page paper\u00e2\u20ac\u201d25%\n10-page paper\u00e2\u20ac\u201d35%\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Dailey's Introduction to Old English (ENGL W4091x) isn't very good.  Professor Dailey clearly knows Old English enough to translate it into Modern English on her own, but her command of the language isn't thorough enough to make her a competent teacher of it.  She's halting, easily flustered, and sometimes seemingly confused in class.  I should add that she's a terrible classroom manager, and assertive, obnoxious students can easily (and do) hijack the class with dumb questions.  Old English is certainly worth learning, but I'd recommend doing it at another institution or on one's own rather than taking this course.\nWorkload:\nRegular translation homework, a midterm, and a final.\n"

On the second day of class I thought I still thought I was in the wrong place, but I carried on.\nBy the third class, I realized what a privilege it is to be in Professor Dailey's class. This woman isn't just smart- she is the walking encyclopedia of her field and what she doesn't know, she is quite willing to admit. She values everyone's opinions, and surprisingly, everyone had interesting and thought-provoking things to say. She expects a lot from you and the work is at times challenging, but you will walk away from her class with more knowledge than you realize at the time. Months later, that knowledge will still be there. \nPlease take a class with Dailey. Don't be intimidated. It's one of those classes from which you walk away feeling rather proud.\nWorkload:\nLots of reading, a midterm and final that require quite a bit of preparation but match the work you've done in class and at home. She gives you great feedback on your papers and will always email you back if you have any questions on the homework. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis is a review for non-medieval studies majors like me.  There are a couple great reasons to take this class.  First of course you will read excellent poems and stories that you will never find by yourself.  Second, Prof. Dailey is one of those rare birds who grades papers thoroughly.  She requires a topic paragraph in advance.  Then she accepts electronic submission of the final.  And she e-mails it back to you covered in comments, along with a paragraph synthesizing everything she said (and you said) at the end.  She corrects grammar and style, suggests how to extend your ideas, and recommends further reading.  Exactly what you want in any humanities class and here you finally get it.\nThe course pursues a good question: how did people understand the past in the past?  I really liked considering this and if you are a history or anthropology major, you might too.  The English majors who dominated the class were more interested in literary stuff, but the professor will speak at length to the question.\nWorkload:\nEach week maybe 30 dense pages of primary text, plus five secondary essays that you can read as deeply as you like, or get away with skipping.  A class presentation, 10 minutes.  One 6-8 pg paper, one 6-10 page paper.  I got the feeling that you were supposed to err towards the longer side.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Dailey is a fantastic professor, one of the most brilliant I've come across (with a memory verging on encyclopedic), who definetly knows her stuff. While she can be quite abstract at times, and therefore a little difficult to follow, this should not be confused with ignorance. I found her grading quite appropriate. She does not inflate grades, so if you're doing B- work, that's what you'll get. I've found she has no trouble disagreeing with student opinions, but does so in an appropriate manner, usually asking for further clarification, helping guide the student back on track. I did quite well with her papers and found her comments extremely helpful for deepening my own thoughts and just generally taking my work to the next level. While it is the responsibility of professors to help their students achieve greater understanding of the material and to guide them in the best articulation of their ideas (which Dailey does in spades), they should not be condemned for calling mediocre or inadequate work for what it is.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Dailey is a very kind person and a young, but excellent professor.  This is a seminar class but an extraordinarily broad survey of medieval lit, and the professor is a bit general on the Dante and Augustine.  But on the Anglo-Saxon texts (her specialty), the course was very interesting, and I recommend it for those with wide-ranging backgrounds in medieval studies.  Dailey also has an impressive grounding in lit theory, which definitely heightened the texts' relevancy and brought some really great insights.  Classmates' presentations were occasionally a waste of time.  This is a passionate professor who clearly cares a great deal about the material and teaching it to her students.  Relaxed class atmosphere, fair grading, foundational texts.  \nWorkload:\n2 papers, a presentation, many texts\n"

In class, she agrees with every comment everyone makes, but when you write your papers, she disagrees with everything.  Her grading is really unfair; a lot of the class receives B-'s or lower.  The class itself is really boring, with no breaks whatsoever.  Most of the class was either sleeping or using their laptops.  She's a terrible teacher who grades unfairly: don't take her.\nWorkload:\nA bunch of short response papers, some pop quizzes on the reading, and 1 big paper\n"
