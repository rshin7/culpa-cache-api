            "review_content": "\nSuwen is a very shy lady who can be very strict with grades, because it is easier for her to take off a few points from your lab and do it for you, than explain to you what you were doing wrong.  Her English is absolutely terrible, although it did improve over the semester. If you need a question answered, save yourself time and ask another TA or Kim or Sara (although Sara can be really sarcastic and mean sometimes), because she probably won't understand you, or if she does, she won't be able to explain the answer in English. Check over your quizes and labs carefully, because many times she would mark a question wrong because you used a synonym that she didn't know.  Also, if you have a dispute, approach her smiling and be really nice, because she is more likely to listen to you. If you show that you do real work for your labs, and you study at least 2-3 hours for the quizes (don't blow them off, they are worth a lot) you should do fine in the course. \nWorkload:\n1 Lab and 1 quiz each week, 1 Practical In-Lab Final\n"
