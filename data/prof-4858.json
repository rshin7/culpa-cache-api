It was her first time teaching a conversation class so it was definitely rough in the beginning to find ways for us to be engaging with the language. By the end of the course though our class was really close. It can very with the day how interesting the class is, sometimes we watched a movie, sometimes we did first grade level worksheets. I can't say it helped me improve my french though. She's also usually late for class. She's really funny and nice but I don't know if I would take another class with her.\nWorkload:\nTwo oral presentations of 10 minutes with a partner. \n"
