He is also not the best at conducting discussions during class, but it was rewarding nonetheless.  I recommend this class for anyone interested in psychology.    \nWorkload:\nNot bad at all: Readings and/or videos for each week that ranged from short to a medium length.  They were all interesting and relevant to the topic and some were fantastic.  There were two 3-4 page papers, both of which we had to hand in a rough draft for.  In most cases, the grades were high enough so that a final draft was not needed.  There is one longer final paper (7-8 pages) for which you do not hand in a draft, and an audio or video interview that you conduct.  In all, the assignments were easy but the concensus among some of the students was that he had very specific expectations that he didn't communicate which resulted in lower grades than expected.  \n"
