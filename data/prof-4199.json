Open only to seniors by application, it's an opportunity to join two great literary minds, who happen to be best friends, in their version of the Great Conversation. The course is surprisingly well organized\u00e2\u20ac\u201dHuyssen and Pamuk take their feedback very, very seriously\u00e2\u20ac\u201daround the interplay of textual and visual media from antiquity to the present. Since it's a literature class, that means mostly conversations about how writers deal with the problem of trying to represent images. There's considerable focus on theories of ekphrasis, discussion of a wide range of texts, mostly very interesting, and a lot of good class discussion.\nHuyssen is a fantastic professor for reasons that should be clear from other reviews. Pamuk is a fantastic author who's still learning his way around a classroom, but nevertheless had some interesting things to say. It's always nice having a class with a Nobel laureate, after all.\nDefinitely recommended if you're into, well, words and pictures. \nWorkload:\nHuyssen is softening. Response postings ONLY ever other week. Lots of reading, but mostly short works. Class discussion. Shockingly, a midterm exam. And of course a final paper on whatever you want to write about.\n"
