At times the class could feel like it was dragging, but sometimes something would come out that would be suprising. Diamond is a little to consumed with his own artistic critic, and his words can sound a little superfoulous during review, but he has a keen eye and can point out flaws that can only lead to you drawing a better piece.\nWorkload:\nfair grader, understanding of outside committments\n"
