            "review_content": "\nKristin is a competent art humanities teacher but her speciality is Russian 20th century art which means that she is not always that knowledgable about the material in art hum.  She is good at explaining the art but sometimes gets nervous and freezes up, not knowing what to say.  She has a good sense of humour and keeps most of the students awake, which is hard to do in any class where the lights are low.  \nWorkload:\n3  3-5 page papers which involve visiting a museum, a mid term, and a final.  Light readings for some sessions. \n"
