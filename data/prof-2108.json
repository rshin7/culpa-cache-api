Whether  your class starts off a little shy and dry or stupid and silent or bright and talented in critiques, it will likely end that way and so the class sufferability in one sense will depend on you. Still, crits are fostered or smothered by the class response to the professor, in Coopers case, a stupid, snippy woman who simply does not, in my opinion, know how to run a succesful drawing class or create a productive atmosphere.  You may improve basic technique by the mere fact of practice, but if you're serious about art, skip out- you'll be stifled by the ridiculously boring and unconstructive critiques and stunted by the lack of exposure to a sophisticated intellectual artistic sensibility.  \n"
