            "review_content": "\nProfessor Lee is great. He's upbeat, incredibly nice, and a very good lecturer. As a for example, his 3 hour long classes never drag, and he encourages a lot of class participation. Plus, he brings candy to class for correct answers!\nI'd highly recommend this class for anyone of any major, if you have an interest in going into consulting or marketing upon graduation. It's great preparation for case interviews -- I took it senior year first semester, and it really brought home concepts that I'd been prepping from \"Case in Point\". I wish I'd taken it earlier, actually, and maybe that would have solidified my post-graduation ambitions earlier.\nThe class itself is pretty easy, and everyone taking it is really into it. Our final projects (a comprehensive marketing plan and presentation for a product of your own making) turned out to be really impressive - some of the groups had actually created and sold the products they had conceived over the duration of the semester. The last day of class, during which we did our presentations, was really fun! The class is full of a lot of talented undergrads, and it's cool to see your classmates outside of the context of your Core classes.\n\nWorkload:\nA final exam (no midterm) that's open book, at least for now, and not too tough as a result; a marketing presentation that your classmates will take very seriously (join a group with a product you really like); weekly assignments that are easy and graded out of 10. You'll only need to know two or three quantitative concepts.\n"
