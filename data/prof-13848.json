Never once answered an email. Drifted off into weird tangents about her own opinions. Turned the class into an epidemiology course when COVID hit despite having zero knowledge of epi. (Granted, also doesn\u2019t have a degree in econ, but she invited plenty of friends from McKinsey to lecture so at least the capitalist barbie had some kens to go along with it). \nWorkload:\nsporadic, most stuff is just for completion but every so often she'll give you a huge assignment with no notice and also no explanation of how to do it and be like \"good luck!\" it's easy to get an A if you just do the assignments on courseworks and participate in a debate. google search the answers since she won't teach you anything on the graded assignments. \n"
