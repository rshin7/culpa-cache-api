            "review_content": "\nIlene was really chill. Her class was pretty relaxed, and while technically you can't miss more than four sessions, she was very flexible and just wanted to see us all pass (and enjoy the game). There wasn't a great deal of actual instruction, since most of the time she would just let us pair up and play by ourselves for 50 minutes with little or no supervision, but she was always happy to answer our questions. She told us that she's actually a tennis player, not a squash player, so maybe that had something to do with it being a relatively hands-off class. Also, she took the class out for pizza at the end of the semester. All in all, a good PE experience. You get out of it exactly what you feel like putting into it.\nWorkload:\nNothing except showing up and participating.\n"
