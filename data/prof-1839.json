He succeeded in rendering his class, \"Reading Freud,\" boring, which is no easy task.\nHe acts uninterested and bored with everyone. \nThe discussions were never deep enough, as though he didn't even really like Freud that much.\nHis assignments totally lacked creativity and when I approached him about a creative final project, he was dismissive and rude to me.\nWorkload:\nOne midterm that treats the readings like problem sets\nOne final paper that involves no analysis\n"

He's not the most exciting character around, but if you have a reasonable amount of discussion, it works just fine. He's also really helpful outside of class and very knowledgeable about the topic. I'd definitely recommend the class. \nWorkload:\nOne book a week, weekly ungraded response papers and a 5-10 page term paper. It's really not a lot of work at all. \n"
