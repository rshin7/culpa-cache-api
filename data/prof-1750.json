He knows everybody's name and loves the game of basketball. he wants everyone to have a good time and learn the fundamentals of the game he loves.  he's as likeable a character as there is.  if you play with zeal, he lets the class know that you're \"juiced\".  get ready to have some fun and chill with the mooch.\nWorkload:\na lot of layups and shooting. also requires ability to laugh at Bramucci's hilarious character.....\n"
