            "review_content": "\nProfessor Katznelson was the most brilliant professor I had at Columbia, as well as being a true inspiration. And TCAP was my favorite class (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not surprised to read this is true for other people too). There were many things I loved about the course. One was how far reaching it is. While the class centers on the New Deal, its title is fitting because it captures themes at the heart of American Politics throughout the twentieth century (and really, central to all periods) such as voting and elections, racial inequality, and separation of powers. The course also provides an examination of totalitarian regimes in Italy, Germany and the Soviet Union. Because of the ambitious nature of the course, any student is certain to find something they are interested in. I used the term paper as a springboard for my thesis. Professor Katznelson incorporates readings and lectures from all of the main subfields in political science: American, political theory, international relations, and comparative politics\u00e2\u20ac\u201dnot to mention history. This is perhaps the only class where I did every reading, not because I felt compelled to, but because I genuinely enjoyed the readings and found the material absorbing. What was wonderful and unique is the particular way in which the lectures always enhanced and complemented the readings, but never simply repeated them\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey always added something new and compelling. Professor Katznelson clearly put time and thought into them, and they were truly fascinating. As a person, Professor Katznelson has always shown such compassion and attentiveness\u00e2\u20ac\u201din this course and beyond (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the privilege of being his student elsewhere as well). He offers superb feedback and takes a genuine interest in his students. If a student could only take one class in political science, this should be it. Much of what he taught is applicable to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics (I kept thinking about realigning elections this year). Beyond that, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever enjoyed learning so much, felt so motivated from the example a professor set, or been so deeply rewarded for putting in hard work as I did during the semesters Professor Katznelson was my professor. These things have had a marked impact on me even after graduating. Professor Katznelson is a true gem at Columbia and I feel so fortunate to have been his student.   \nWorkload:\nClass participation, one research paper, one midterm, and one final exam. If you do the readings, review them and the main themes from class, you will do fine on the exams.  The same is true for the paper as long as you plan ahead (it helps to request feedback from Professor Katznelson and/or your TA). The workload is entirely doable and he is an extremely fair grader. In other words, if you put in real effort, you will be rewarded. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis was by far the best class I have taken at Columbia. \nProfessor Katznelson is one of the best lecturers at this university. Only Katznelson and Foner have been able to capture my attention for the full 85 minutes in a lecture class. He knows the material better than any other scholar. He is an expert in Southern Congressional studies during the 20th century and so his passion comes out during that section of the course. Nonetheless, from the first to the last lecture, he not only discussed interesting material (fear as a motive for political action, how the South controlled Congress, constitutional exceptionalism in times of total war) but also posed thought provoking questions or \"puzzles\" as he called them. He's also incredibly helpful in office hours and is a HUGE Knicks fan and fun to talk to during basketball season.\nThis was one of the few classes I enjoyed writing a paper for. He gives you complete autonomy into choosing your topic; as long as it is relevant to the course material, you're good. I ended up figuring out the topic for my thesis through this paper. \nLike any other class, it isn't hard to get an A if you do all of the reading, go to lecture, speak up in section, and write a good paper. I'd advise any potential students to meet with their TAs about the paper. Mine was basically written in a 30 minute conversation with my TA. \nAs for the exams, they were tricky but easy if you do the readings. He gives essay questions and short answers on the midterm. The short answer questions were basically given a list of 4 authors, choose 3 and either defend or reject a given statement. The statements/authors are well matched and its basically designed to test if you did the reading and can analyze. The final is the same format with 10 IDs on basic terms that you will undoubtedly know at the end of the term.\n\nWorkload:\nOne midterm (20%), one final (cumulative) (30%), a 10 page paper (25%) and section participation (25%). Reading was incredibly heavy for a lecture and heavily pertinent for exams. \n"

            "review_content": "\nJust updating for a more recent review, took Fall 2006. Course focuses on New Deal period and \"crisis of Liberalism.\" Katznelson emphasizes how Liberalism was able to evolve to confront challenges of 20th century. Course is very interesting, and with reading and 60% attendance quite easy. Highly recommended.\nWorkload:\nHeavy reading, but gentle grading on midterm & final. 8-10 pg paper w abstract due early in semester. Discussion group is simply review of readings.\n"

            "review_content": "\nDon't be fooled by the title. This class is not a survey course, but rather an intensive look at the politics of the New Deal. Not that that's a bad thing; the class is an in-depth study of the biggest turning point in modern American politics, as well as a great send-up of old school liberalism. Katznelson is a class act, a warm and outgoing teacher as well as one of the leading scholars in the field. He's an outstanding lecturer too, which is a good thing considering how dry and abstract much of the material is. Definitely worth taking for anyone interested in American Politics or just liberalism in general\nWorkload:\nFear the reading. There's a whole lot of it, and while there are some real gems (especially the contemporary texts), many of the assignments are pretty useless. Three reading quizzes, a 10-page paper, a final, and mandatory discussion sections make up the grade. \n"
