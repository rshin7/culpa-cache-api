            "review_content": "\nDO NOT TAKE ANY CLASS WITH HER EVER. EVER. EVER.\nI had psych stats with her and she is the worst professor I've ever had it was almost unreal. \nShe never was able to explain anything and it was so evident that she had no idea what she was talking about that you couldn't help but pity her. She said on the first day of class that she specializes in developmental psychology but what she really must have beens saying is that she knows absolutely nothing about psychology statistics. \nShe is so incapable of answering questions she would blatantly admit she wouldn't understand what the student was saying and would move on. Sometimes she would avoid asking if we had questions/ going over confusing coursework because she wouldn't be able to answer questions. So we would go on to new material without fully knowing the previous material. \nAll her power points are copied straight from the book that she just reads off. And she goes so fast taking notes is impossible. \nThe only reason i ever went to class ever was to turn in homework that she only graded for completion. Other than that it was the biggest waste of time.\nshe also has the weirdest sense of humor that comes off as rude, sarcastic, and hesitant. \nI had to learn all the material from the book because words cannot emphasize how little help she was. I scored well above average on all the tests, studied a ridiculous amount, and still ended up getting a B in this class. \n\nWorkload:\n3 long, hard midterm exams with a ll types of questions. Once I didn't even finish the exam. A lot of questions that she didn't funny explain or explain at all. \nShe doesn't curve but gives 3 5 pt extra credit opportunities that aren't much help\n"

            "review_content": "\nShe's not that bad. I took her course over the summer and yes, it is DULL, but it's not entirely her fault. She's pretty funny, actually, and her parenting stories break up some boring material. True that she does basically recite what's in the textbook (by reading it off the ppt slides), but part of that is attributable to trying to squeeze a lot of information into a short period. I personally find developmental psych monumentally dull, so I don't blame it on her. And whoever said the text book was more interesting must have had a different book, because the one we used made me want to blind myself to be able to stop reading. The tests were also not that hard, and she offered extra credit because she very obviously wants everyone to do well. She IS, however, pretty disorganized, often forgetting to send us things she'd promised or sending them so late as to almost be useless. \nIn short, the class is not the nightmarish experience the other reviews make it out to be. I wouldn't take it for kicks but if you need it, don't dread it, it'll be fine.\nWorkload:\nFor Summer: Midterm and a final, each worth 45%. Participation worth 10% (but it's a lecture class, so...). A lot of textbook reading of dubious necessity. She ended up assigning a 2 page paper reflecting on a NYT article worth up to 10 points on your midterm score.\n"

I sat through this class wishing that she would say ONE intelligent thing, but alas, nope!  She also taught both lab sections and would change her mind from Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday morning and then ask the Wednesday morning lab to repeat information to Tuesday.  This resulted in the such mass confusion that everyone failed their first assignment.  The grading rubrics she gave the TAs for the lab were absurd!  This is why more than half of the lab students are pass/failing the class.\nNot only is she a failure as a teacher but she is a failure as a parent as she tells us in class.  Her stories detail all of her children's mishaps with the law and otherwise.  I feel so badly for her, but seriously....\nDO NOT GO NEAR HER!\nWorkload:\n2 midterms where you have to memorize every word the textbook.  For the lab there are major writing assignments and 2 lab write-ups (about 40 pages each)!\n"

I guess she is nice, the few times I did try to approach her, she spoke to me like if I was a 2 year old, which was not appreciated. I did well in her first exam, but couldn't take her lectures so I dropped her course. If you need to take Dev.Psych. wait to take it with Nim Tottenham, she rocks!! \nWorkload:\n3 very hard exams \n"

But honestly, I found the textbook to be more exciting and intellectually stimulating than she was.  Also, anyone who has taken a gender class wil probably find her lecture on the differences between boys and girls to be mildly offensive.  She takes attendance, so bring your laptop to class and play solitaire.\nHer two midterms were ridiculously hard, and require you to memorize every minute detail in the textbook.  The second midterm was given one week before the final (she obviously thinks that her class is the only one we\u00c2\u2019re taking).  If that wasn\u00c2\u2019t bad enough, she posted our midterm grades on the blackboard right before we took the final: 3 students got an A, and 9 students failed.  You would think a psych professor would know better.  And for the record, I got a B+ in her class (just so you know that I\u00c2\u2019m not a bitter student who got a C).  However, I know the majority of the class did not do so well.\nOn the flip side, her final was really easy.  She gave us the essay questions that were going to be on the exam a week earlier, so you really only had to prepare the night before the test.\nAvoid this class if you can.\n\nWorkload:\nTwo really hard midterms (multiple choice), one easy final (essay), and class attendance.  She gives a few extra credit assignments throughout the semester. \n"

I wouldn't have gone to class at all if she didn't take attendance and show random videos that were usually mentioned on exams.  Read the textbook and use her notes to highlight what's most important, and you will do well on her exams. It's a lot of memorization, but also a lot of common sense... overall, I recommend this as a nice blow off class.\nWorkload:\n2 exams (I thought the first one was really easy and the second one was way too difficult), 1 final that you hardly needed to prepare for, and some opportunities for extra credit.\n"

Her classes generally consist of her detailing some incredibly basic material for 15 minutes or so, then spending the remaining time talking about her family or showing movies that serve little purpose other than to allow you to doze off.  However, despite her incredibly kind demeanor, she is a tough grader and does expect you to know the material from the book she 'didn't get a chance to cover' in class.  Much of the semester is spent by students giving oral reports for the first half of the class, giving her another opportunity to kick back and relax.  I don't mean to sound venomous, she really is nice, but it's somewhat vexing.  The class is a relaxing way to spend an hour or two, but does require a lot of reading to figure out what the hell you're supposed to be learning.\nWorkload:\n1 oral presentation, 1 extensive research paper (with a minimum of sources that make it fairly cumbersome), and a final consisting of short essay questions.

For example, we spent hours listening to stories about her children... lovely, but totally uninteresting to anyone but their grandmother.  We also had to watch videos of childhood and fetal development- slightly educational but mostly just dull.  It got painful at times.  I hate to critisize this class because Crisafi was so good to us, but I also hate to sit in class and feel as though I could learn all the material by myself by reading some paperback, popular psych book over a weekend.  Oh, but don't be fooled. Just because you're taking it easy in class doesn't mean you'll breeze through the exam.  You'll have to study- not a lot, but she often tests on things in the book that she didn't have time to go over in class.    All in all, I'd say the professor was good, but the class was flakey.  \n"
