            "review_content": "\nProfessor Watson is an incredibly nice woman who is very approachable and receptive to helping students. That being said, I didn't think she was a great professor. \nI wanted to get a lot out of uwriting and develop into a better writer. However, I don't think Professor Watson is the best teacher in terms of helping students grow as writers. Professor Watson will rarely/never edit your grammar, so if you aren't good at that, then this may be the class for you. She is much more focused on bigger ideas and the content than on the style of your writing.\nPerhaps the biggest flaw I found in Professor Watson was the randomness in giving out grades. Each time I thought I wrote an excellent paper, I received a B, and each time I thought my paper was below average, I somehow conjured an A. She does provide an extra credit opportunity at the end of the semester, but in general, her grading is totally subjective and random.\nI recommend going to her office hours and talking through her comments with you. \n \nWorkload:\nProbably less than average for uwriting. Many of my friends who took uwriting constantly complained about a ton of readings, but Professor Watson doesn't give too many. As for the writing, all uwriting classes have 4 progressions with similar deadlines. Her class is no different. \n"
