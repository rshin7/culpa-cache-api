            "review_content": "\nPersian with Hassan is a great overall experience. He is unorthodox, and he challenges his students, but he is extremely fair and he will work with you after class and in office hours until you understand whatever material may be confusing you. He is interested in seeing his students succeed with their Persian pursuits, and attempts to cater to the broad variety of interests students have for studying Persian. He may seem imposing at first, but has a terrific sense of humor.\nClass usually begins with Hassan greeting the class, then elaborating on questions he receives. He may follow tangents of thought regarding Persian in the beginning of class, but that is his way of exposing his students to the Persian language. He makes it a point to expose his students to both formal Persian and colloquial Persian, as well as Persian poetry, stories, and music. He will always make it very clear what students are responsible for homework and \"exams\".\nWorkload:\nThe workload can be formidable, but that should be expected in any of the MESAAS language classes. Homework will often consist of assignments from the book, as well as worksheets Hassan assigns. The \"exams\" in this class are more like long quizzes. There are four or five of these quizzes - Hassan uses these to prepare you for the final. After two semesters, I can say that the department's finals consistently feel easier than some of Hassan's quizzes. I guess his strategy works.\nHomework Assignments ~ 30%\n\"Exams\" ~ 35%\nCultural Project/Presentation ~ 5%\nMedia Worksheets ~ 10%\nFinal ~ 20%\n"
