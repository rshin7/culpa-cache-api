Which makes it confusing and chaotic to attempt any combination when it changes each time!  Nor does he EVER give personal corrections or really seem to actually be watching us dance or helping us get better.  Some students have fun with Ted- but if you want to actually dance and improve your technique, don't take his class!\nWorkload:\nnone\n"
