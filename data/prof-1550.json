            "review_content": "\nProf. Levicky is by far one of the best teachers I have ever had.  He can take  conceptually difficult topics and make it easy to learn for the class.  I, for one, never would have thought that I would ever understand transport phenomena, but I do understand!\nNot only can he teach, but he is also very understanding and patient.  He never makes us students feel dumb when we ask him questions.  I would recommend taking ANY of his courses because you TRULY do learn in his class.\nWorkload:\nNot heavy at all.  5 relatively easy half-hour quizzes (with one written sheet) with a 20 minute oral final.  HW not graded but good to do to prepare for quizzes.  Drop lowest quiz grade.\n"
