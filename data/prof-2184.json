Every other person that I knew taking frontiers at the same time as me was stuck doing twice as much work and being twice as bored in seminar. He is a really nice guy with hilarious stories and he is always willing to chat after class about anything. He holds incredibly useful reviews before the midterm and final and grades both pretty fairly/easily.\nWorkload:\nGives about half of the problem sets out that any other section does. \n"
