She is a fair grader and while the syllabus may seem daunting at first, it's definately do-able.  I suggest taking any class she teaches.\nWorkload:\nVery managable.  Three papers and short quiz, but lots of reading which you can kind of skip around with as long as you get the main point of the readings.\n"
