Fortunately, Zhi has an approach to explaining the intricacies, purpose and applications of the subject that brings it into perfect clarity.  He is infinitely patient of questions and always extremely well-prepared.\nIf you are a reading this review and are concerned over the issue of instructors teaching in their non-native language, let me assuage your fears (in this instance).  Though Zhi's English is not word-perfect, it is excellent, and his lectures are well-delivered.  Zhi was never unable to communicate a point effectively in my experience.\nWorkload:\nThe workload was determined by the calculus curriculum, not directly by Zhi.  I thought it was fair.\n"
