Andrew Nathan provides a broad overview of the various aspects of human rights. The readings are really interesting, however they are very heavy and I wasn't able to do them all. Nonetheless, I still did well in the class and got an A. If you put in the work, this class is easy to do well in. There are 2 papers and a take-home midterm/final. Different TAs grade each assignment, so the grading can vary-- however, if you adequately and appropriately answer the questions, you should be fine! \nWorkload:\n(above)\n"

If you're a poli sci major and you don't want to do anything (as in not attend classes, not attend discussion sections, not do readings), this is THE class for you. \nI had really high hopes for this class given Andrew Nathan's prestige and all, but I found that I was ALWAYS put to sleep by his voice. There's something about it that is so monotonous that it lulls me to sleep and there really was no fighting it. Additionally, Professor Nathan's lecture style is horrible in that the trajectory of his sentences reflect his train of thought. Horrible for taking notes--I gave up and stopped attending classes. \nI literally didn't attend lecture, discussion section and did not do any readings for a good two months. I completed two papers that were unrelated to things covered in lecture and got no points off on the take home midterm. I have never received a better score on a midterm than I did in Professor Nathan's class (keep in mind that I literally did not attend class). \nI'm not going to lie and tell you that I learned so much in this class because to be honest, I did not. I think I came out with the same amount of knowledge about China and \"Foreign policy\" in China as I had when I first entered the lecture with high hopes in January. \nWorkload:\n2 papers, one take home midterm, one take home final.\n"

By taking decent notes you will do well in this class. The 2 exploration papers I thought were great, no vague poli-sci intro theoretical question, you get to chose exactly what you want to write about. I chose Srebrenica for my first paper, a pretty obvious topic, and got a B+ even though I thought it was a good paper. For the 2nd one I chose the Omar Khadr case (a canadian afghan minor detained in guantanamo and tortured for being accused of working as a terrorist) which was more obscure and also current events got me which got me an A (I think because they hadnt read it 5000 times unlike my first paper). The exams are decent, I went to most of the TA sessions which were really helpful and interesting, but I basically got all my knowledge from the lectures. This class made me want to become a human rights major actually. TAKE IT!

            "review_content": "\nI had been looking forward to this class since enrolling at Columbia. Never had a chance to formally study human rights before, and since this is one of the only courses explicitly offered by the human rights department it seemed like a showpiece for the new undergraduate major. Nathan is a nice guy, the TAs are all brilliant, and they obviously care about the students. Doesn't matter...Wikipedia scratches the surface of human rights - in theory, real-world practice or academic use - more than this class does.\nYou can skip the lectures if you're not interested in the subject. Nathan lectures, too quickly and without slides. He defines things like women's rights by pointing to the relevant UN treaty and talking about how it is bad to hit your wife or discriminate based on gender because the UN says so. I suspect that if the UN hadn't been able to pass the treaty, he would be okay with skipping it because that would mean it wasn't officially a human right. Rinse and repeat for refugee rights, indigenous peoples, and the rights of businesses. Don't expect something more complicated like delving into the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment or the death penalty. Don't expect a thorough discussion of a framework or terms that will help you in future human rights/polisci classes.\nI even bought all the books! Not that I had to. Just wanted to ensure that I kicked ass in my major's course. This was a mistake. No one kept up with the readings, including myself. They seemed relevant but weren't integrated into the material at all. None of the previous students or human rights majors in the course with me read anything more than the one main book (Neier) at best. I also only went to one (optional) TA session and never saw the professor because I didn't want to be grilled about untouched readings.\nAs a transfer student, I don't have enough time left to change my major. After taking this class, I would if I could. THIS is the foundation of a top human rights department? An entire semester almost entirely devoted to memorizing different, transient UN bodies and treaties? Not a word about conflict resolution, or peace and justice studies, or the workings of social movements, or...?\nWorkload:\nTwo essays - either an \"exploration\" of a topic or a book review, plus a take-home midterm and final. Each of the four TAs graded one paper. One time, Nathan accepted an essay several hours after it was due when I slept through class.\nI got an A on everything and in the class. I worked hard to show off but it's probably an easy B or above even if you're not a social sciences major.\n"

Also, the TAs/Grader are nice people too as they reward you with good grades if you have worked hard enough on your assignments and they answered you inquiries (with patience) when you are in doubt.

However, these classes do not match the enthusiasm surrounding him. While he has many interesting and insightful points to make in class, his lectures are largely disorganized. He does not use slides, and instead, allows for a seeming oral free-for-fall, touching on any topics that seem to come to mind as they concern the topic of the day. As should be expected, he is enlightening, but again, only to a certain extent in his capacity as professor for this class. Form a group and share notes; there is no way any one person can gather all his says in one sitting.\nOn another note, Nathan is amazingly personable. Given his level of domestic and international fame as a scholar, he is nonetheless willing to meet for more than a half hour for first-year undergraduates. If you don't like a grade a TA gives you, he will meet with you to talk it over. And if he finds your arguments legitimate, he will change the grade for you -- that simple! In the end, I would definitely suggest this class. Just do not get your hopes TOO high. He deserves praise, but his mainly disorganized lectures are often a drag. \nWorkload:\nThe LONGEST reading list I have ever seen. You need not read all of them, skimming is fine and perhaps necessary, but this is not true is you want to attend the optional discussion sections, which many say are rewarding. 2 papers and midterm and final -- All are take-home and are each worth 25% of your final grade.\n"

Surely this class is considered easy with relatively little work, but it is filled with too much political correctness to be a great class (watch out those annoying people--they love to show off their lack of knowledge and reiterate their random sinophile, perhaps to appeal Nathan). The lectures are best characterized by Nathan's constantly scratching his head saying that his lectures are out of control, and a glance at the syllabus/reading list tells you how little effort Nathan seems to have put into teaching the course. Most of the concepts/arguments are outdated, and there is no topic assigned for the two essays. Instead students are left with several pretentiously ambiguous categories of writing to work on (which sounds nice at first, but actually a waste of time for students to come up with something \"interesting\" to write...).

Assumes that you have a lot of knowledge about political theory that you may not have -- I for example am majoring in human rights but NOT polisci, so had no previous political theory knowledge (not to mention that it's supposed to be an intro course).\nI am now taking the Barnard colloquium, taught by Peter Juviler, \"Human Rights in a Diverse World,\" which has essentially the same syllabus, except I'm actually learning stuff this time.\nSo my advice is: If you're a polisci major, don't take this class to fill a requirement, find something else.\nIf you're a Barnard student who wants to take this to fill a 9 ways of knowing requirement, I guarantee there are better courses you can find to fill it.\nAnd if you're a human rights major and think there is no way around it, you may or may not be right.  I'm not sure about Columbia students, but I know Barnard students who avoided taking it by taking the colloquium (taught by Juviler) first and then claiming that they didn't need to take the intro class cuz it would be pointless.  It's a small and new department so things like this are easy to get around.\nMy point is, unless you think there is absolutely no way around it, don't take this class.  It's not awful, just a complete waste of time and -- especially if you're going to take more human rights classes in the future.\nOh -- if you do take it, my one piece of advice is to go to class during the guest lectures.  There are a fair amount of these and almost all of them were amazing.  It was just Nathan that sucked.\nWorkload:\neasy easy easy. you don't have to go to class as the final and midterm are take-home.  the papers are easy too but unfortunately some TAs are easier graders than others, and most TAs are easier graders than nathan.  you don't have to do the readings either. also extremely extremely leniant about deadlines.\n"

Profs. Nathan and Hertel both provided 2-hour office hours, as well as TAs.  There is support from the TAs, profs and the human rights undergraduate staff if you want to take advantage of it.  The core of human rights, we learn,  is respecting human dignity, which is pretty much repeated in all major human rights documents, Prof. Nathan is an extraordinary professor, he likes to teach and to encourage students, and he started this course, and without him, none of the other political science TAs, who were immensely popular assisting him in this class, and Prof. Hertel, who just obtained her PhD here,  would have had an opportunity to show themselves to us.  A final point made about the class by a TA was that she hoped students should take away a sense of what human rights are and how they can add to that debate with their own concerns about rights.

The student in referring to the first drafter who wrote it with only one arm seemed to be referring to the idea that because the first drafter was handicapped, he would naturally include consideration for that.  The TAs along with the professors set a great example of freedom of speech and opinion, and sometimes even entertained us with their differing points of view on topics.  Students are free to express themselves in class and discussions.

Prof. Nathan needs three other T.A.'s to cover his verbal blunders, but Candace, Juntao, and Dani are awesome.  The class is a winner, definetly take it, just skip all of Prof. Nathan's lectures.\nWorkload:\nNot too bad.  Two in-depth research papers on anything you want to write about in Human Rights.  Take home midterm and final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI had him for first semester CC.  Class usually started with a short presentation of the book, and then a guided class discussion.  I found him to have a very good knowledge of the text, and the discussions to be interesting.  If the discussion lagged he would take a larger roll, if kids had a lot to say he would let it flow naturally.  He was pretty good about keeping the kids who liked to hear their own voice in check though.  He clearly liked the material, and enjoyed teaching the class.  He is very open minded and won't stiffle your opinion or grade you down just because he disagrees with you.  On both my midterm and final he made a point of saying he disagreed with my position, but felt i presented/argued it well and gave me good grades.\nHe specifies pages and sections of books to read.  The assignments are usually manageable, although he gets a little carried away with \"The City of God\" and he assigns huge swaths of the Koran.  I slept through some classes with no problem, also enjoyed class discussions.  As long as SOME people in the class are talking and discussing he has no issues and lets sleeping dogs lie.  The class is obviously better if you actually read the material, but you can get by with just skimming as long as others actually read or are good at BS'ing.    Definately a better than average professor.\nWorkload:\nTake home midterm, take home final.\n"

He got lots of press for publishing the Tiananmen Papers. He's even a nice man and a very nice advisor. Given all that, you'd think he would be a bit more interesting as a lecturer. I fell asleep in every one of his lectures. I expected to learn more about the cryptic and mysterious Chinese side of foreign policy formation, but Nathan teaches essentially a course on American policy towards China and an American view of other countries' policies towards China. He likes to involve student discussion into classes, which is nice, and the EP-3 incident spiced up all our lives. But the lecture content itself is pretty predictable.\nWorkload:\nThe reading list is insane. But Nathan and his TA tell you that you don't have to read all of it. one paper and a takehome final, but don't expect them to be easy on you as an undergrad. The discussion sections were useless.\n"

Since China is his specialty, he often goes off topic, but that just means you, too, can talk about anything when you're discussing the readings.
