Class was small, ran like 3/4 lecture, 1/4 seminar. but that was fine, b/c this guy obviously knows his stuff and gives good, but dry lectures. wish they had been more theoretical or linked to dramaturgy, but still interesting.  he really treats the class like a college course (5 2 page papers on whatever you want to talk about or a reading log instead) and neither babies you nor takes you very seriously. he's just kind of chill, and, being wise, he has a right to be.  for some reason, class is a magnet for old people and some grad students. he was totally respectful and nice to me as a freshman, very personable after class, and i loved that he openly contradicted ass-kissing and pompous grad students.  he's fair dammit. \nWorkload:\nnot too bad at all. play per class. 5 2 page papers about any topic (i really enjoyed being able to write about whatever i wanted, whatever i got the most out of, nice to be able to explore) and a final (for undergrads)...oh yeah or substitute a reading log for your papers. \n"
