She makes such an effort to make the class flow naturally, and we have engaged in so many interesting conversations beyond what we were talking about in class. 10/10 UW experience. Wish she taught more classes!\nWorkload:\nNormal for UW. Readings for first 3 essay, barely any for P4. Super interesting readings. \n"
