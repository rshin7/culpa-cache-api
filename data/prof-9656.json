He knows how to make boring topics very not boring.  The class entails 2 essays around 6 pages each, not too bad but somewhat challenging. Also weekly readings but easy to get away with not doing them if that's what you're into. 9/10 would recommend.\nWorkload:\n4 quizzes, weekly readings for section, 2 essays\n"
