            "review_content": "\nProfessor Albes is hands down one of the best teachers in the department. I still can't believe the amount of French I learned while taking her class even though I've taken French language classes for multiple years. She teaches grammar concepts in a concise, meaningful way that allows you to both appreciate the beauty of the language while also understanding how to use it. She is also insanely understanding and is absolutely willing to work with you if you need an extension on a composition or would just like to improve your French skills. I would highly recommend her for whatever class she teaches. \nWorkload:\nThe workload is the same as other French classes. Also, exams are standardized for all sections of the same class and are fair but thoroughly cover the material learned in class. \n"
