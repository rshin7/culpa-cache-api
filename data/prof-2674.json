            "review_content": "\nUnless you've steeled yourself for the challenge, and/or somehow know you have latent linguistic ability, Czech is probably not a good first foreign language to study (because of its complexity). But Jeff is an EXCELLENT teacher: organized, focused, patient, witty, and genuinely interested in seeing his students wrap their heads around the language. The homework is light but effective for getting repetitive practice of the concepts, which are reinforced in class before and after assignments. Occasional pop quiz on vocab. No surprises on the exams.\nIf you want to learn Czech, count yourself lucky to be at an institution that teaches it and teaches it well. Absolutely take this class.\nWorkload:\nLight for fast memorizers and those with a bent for languages, light-to-medium for normal smart people\n"
