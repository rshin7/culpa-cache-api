            "review_content": "\nI unreservedly loved Professor Sanders approach to the plays we read in Twentieth Century Central European Drama. He is hugely knowledgeable and able to elucidate the larger picture in terms of small details. The content of the syllabus is beyond fascinating and touches upon a number of topics relevant to the region and era (class dynamics, gender, politics, nationalism, existentialism etc.).  \nThat being said Professor Sanders usually spends the entirety of the seminar lecturing.  It would be beneficial to allow for student participation beyond reading passages. Granted this is not always a terrible thing for days where you are just mad tired. Probably should read all the plays though as he will randomly ask people what they thought of specific details.\nWorkload:\nRead about a play per class. Generally manageable. If the plays are long Prof. Sanders will spread the reading over two classes.\nThere is a take home midterm and final that are fairly simple. You are given a good amount of time to complete them (I believe the midterm was given to us over a week before it was due. The take home final was given nearly a month before it was due).\nThere is also a final research paper (10-15 pages) on a topic of your choice. Meet with Prof. a number of times to develop topic.\nI actually really enjoyed the format of the class. The readings were manageable and the take home mid term and final were actually intellectually valuable (a problem with many classes at this university).\n"
