            "review_content": "\nCourse content is interesting but the knowledge and intrigue of the material is completely detracted and butchered by Professor Metcalfe's careless instruction and presentation efforts, not to mention her complete lack of course structure and organization. Her lecture slides have no rhyme or rhythm and each slide uses varying font type and size. There may be a sentence here and then two paragraphs there. In short, there is no continuity to her slides whatsoever. To make matters worse, her PowerPoint background is sometimes in black and font in white which makes viewing/discerning the print outs extremely difficult. Her methods are primitive and serve more as a learning hindrance than anything else. It is somewhat ironic that her course is names as such. \nHowever, if you are a dedicated and patient student, it is possible to excel in her course, but with extraneous effort. Work with the TAs who have taken her course before and understand the struggles that students face with Janet; they are on your side and try to assist in any way possible. Go to the review sessions that are held before every exam -- they are extremely helpful. **Please note workload description below.\nPLEASE NOTE: Prof refuses to provide electronic copies of her lecture slides. There is ONE, yes ONE, physical copy of her lecture slides that are placed on reserve at the library for a class of 60+ students to share.   \nWorkload:\n5 (yes, FIVE) tests/exams all equally weighted (20% each). The \"final\" is slightly longer in format than the other 4 midterms but worth the same and is cumulative. 4th midterm is on the last day of class. If you miss/do very poorly on an exam, you have the option of replacing your lowest grade with an optional paper, also due on the last day of class unless granted an extension by Prof. \nSame 2 semester books as noted in past reviews, Sapolsky and Schacter.\nBe prepared to budget/expend/WASTE 1-2 hours of your time each week just to have the lecture notes scanned/copied. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI have to say that the reviews for this course and Janet surprised me. I'm glad I didn't read them before taking her course, because I would have thought about taking a different one and missed out. I agree that Prof Metcalfe can be aloof and potentially abrasive outside of class while during lectures seem engaged and enthusiastic. However, I don't think she is unreasonable or harsh, as others have suggested. Also, it was clear that she had spent a lot of time thinking about how to structure the course. She explained during the first class that the presentation of the material and spacing of exams is designed to maximize long-term retention, which related to the course topic itself. I found her lectures interesting, often supplementing and informing the readings. Concepts that were previously taught were integrated into new material, which helped reinforced learning them the first time and was helpful enough for me that it cut down on the amount of studying I would have otherwise had to do. That being said, the lectures also often presented material that was expected to be learned for exams, but not in any of the course readings. However, almost everything she covers that is not in the readings is in the book \"Thinking fast and slow\" by Kahneman. I would highly recommend reading it if you plan to take this course--it'll make your life a lot easier, esp. if you miss lectures.   \nShe gives a term/review sheet for each exam, of which there are 4 and a final (20% each), but she won't email it out until ~2 days before the exam and there are about 3x as many things on it than are on the exam. The TAs did a wonderful job putting together ppts and review sessions that helped focus studying. Prof. Metcalfe doesn't post lecture ppts, but she keeps a copy of each on the door of her lab. She lets you replace one exam grade with a research paper. Overall, this was one of the better courses I have taken in the psych dept and Prof. Metcalfe is one of the better lecturers I've had. I would recommend the class--especially if you're interested in metacognition. \nWorkload:\n5-10 published psych studies per section (there are 4 sections, each followed by an exam) and two psych books (Shacter's \"Searching for Memory\" & Sapolsky's \"Why zebras don't get ulcers\"). reading is easy but there are a lot of material and expt designs you are expected to know\n"

Unless you go into this class with some background it can be easy to get lost.  \nTo back up, I believe they should have pre-requisites for this class. I took Psychology of Learning at Barnard (HATED that class, but it prepared me the most for this class), Biology 1001, and a Social Cognition course (in case you could not tell, I am a psych major) and I truly believe all of those courses better prepared me for this class.\nThe two books are basically what the entire course centers on and they are very interesting. Another friend who got an even better grade than I did had read both books over the summer and was just leisurely reading them now. He literally only got .5 taken off on each test. \nAnd speaking of the tests... I mean seriously.. she gives out a study sheet.. i would sometimes study the day before or two days before just filling out those terms and I would do fine!\nOh! I guess I should also add that it helps tremendously to record the class lecture since she does not post the slides. But that kind of forces you to pay attention. \nThen, when studying just listen to the audio of the class over as you fill in the study sheet. But that study sheet will pretty much be the test. \nThe final was much easer than i expected. It was worth 20 points as well and instead of focusing on things that we did not get tested on before, it was on popular questions from all of the past tests! So for the last test I recomend looking over your past tests.\nAll in all, its NOT THAT BAD!! But I'd definitely recommend it for enthusiastic psych majors. \n\nWorkload:\nweekly readings. A couple articles and/or a couple chapters from the books you are reading (Sapolsky & Schacter). She posts all articles on courseworks. \n5 tests. All written down but easy to BS if you crammed. each test is worth 20 points. it adds up to 100 points and add all of them up will be your grade. She drops the lowest score if you replace it with a paper that you have to discuss the topic with her.\nI found the material absolutely fascinating. I did not really think that the material was that heavy either. All articles are primary articles so you do not even have to read the entire thing. just the general gist you have to understand. \n"

The subject area: origins of self-reflective consciousness, had so much potential, but it was immediately evident from the first few classes that Janet Metcalfe cared very little, if at all, about this class that she taught. \nInstead of doing any guidance herself, she assigned very vague topics for presentations every week and had the students pair up to make the presentations and select the readings for that week. She did not do the readings, never gave us feedback about our presentations, was always away. Basically, she literally had no role in the class other than to assign us a grade at the end. The discussions were only interesting due to the other students in the class, not to any knowledge she cared to share.\nMoreover, I realized throughout the course that she exhibited an incredible bias towards psychology majors who have done research with other psych professors. Name dropping was especially pleasing to her, as was the random allusions to obscure concepts. Also, quoting from another culpa review: \"self-awareness goes a long way, folks. If your anecdote has no other purpose than to drop an obscure psych term only tangentially related to the material, maybe consider saving it for the diary, mm?\"\nWhat is the most damning characteristic about her though, is that she ONLY cares about her research. She doesn't care if we are interested in other areas besides her area of research and discourage it. She recommends using her rough drafts of papers for our presentations so that we can give her feedback on how to make it better and email her about grammatical mistakes. I'm sorry, is this a copy editing class???? She says that our final papers should be \"publication quality\", probably so that she can rip off them for her upcoming pubs.\nShe also doesn't actually grade anything... and really just gives good grades to those kids that she \"liked\" from the outset. I am saying this, having made an A in the class.\nIn conclusion, a very disappointing, uninteresting, unprofessional professor. Don't take this class.\n\nWorkload:\nNot bad, but a waste of time.\n"

She'll go on and on about how important it is to keep up with the readings and study a little bit every night to maximize retention, but then she won't send out the list of terms to memorize before the exam unti the day before or let you know what readings you should have been doing over the past three weeks. She's a nice professor, but it seems like she has no clue that assigning landslides of reading and terms 2-3 days before her midterms is a no-win for all.\nAlso, instead of making the lectures available online, she makes one single paper copy of each day's slide available in the Psych Dept. This is more of an inconvenience than any true fault, but I think it speaks to problems in her lecturing style. She paraphrases plain text slides and blows past graphs she expects you to recreate on exams. If you can't come out of a 75 minute lecture with any take-away points because you're frantically taking down every word she says and focusing on the labels of axes rather than the explanations and meanings of study results, I just don't know if that's an effective lecture. \nAs others have noted, the TAs are the key to getting anything out of this course. Karen is amazing at listening to what students need and is an exceptional resource. \nI''ve had many of the exact same memory/stress studies and concepts taught to me more compellingly as part of a unit or lesson in psych courses with other focuses. I'd recommend embracing that route as much as possible until this course gets a major rethink. \nWorkload:\n3 non-cumulative short answer midterms worth 25% each\n1 cumulative final worth 25%\n1 optional end of semester essay to replace one of the midterm grades reporting on relevant research of your choice\n"

Test questions were generally fair and straightforward. Feedback was given after each midterm and we were allowed to keep our responses. TA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were generally helpful and available (though bad at explaining key concepts). \nHowever, several pedagogical flaws made it difficult to succeed in this class and comprehend the material. First, her Power Points suck.  No discernible outline, oddly worded paragraphs on slides\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe reads these verbatim, flips slides too quickly then refuses to post the Power Points.  \nSecond, course themes weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t well defined. We constantly returned to and developed previously covered topics, however the connections weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explicitly stated which made preparation for the cumulative final maddening. TA's should have outlined course themes at least. \nThird, review sheets were posted too close to the exam (often posted a day or two prior). This encourages \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmassed practice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (right guys?!) because studying with a promised review sheet is more efficient, particularly when so much material is covered on each exam. Either don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t post a review sheet at all or post one at least 1 week beforehand. \nFourth, student questions about experimental methods were not handled well. The TONS of experiments discussed in class and in readings are flawed and their implications are sometimes questionable and vague yet questions were often greeted with annoyance and dismissal.\nFinally, grading was arbitrary\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I lucked out because I often included the extraneous info they required for the definitions but did not specify on the test!

The experiments themselves are explained very poorly in class, so you have to go back to the original paper and understand the method and results yourself. \nJanet is very nice and all, very friendly in class, but when it comes to the bottom line of coherent, organized teaching I found it hard in this class, and I know at least handful of people who were very frustrated with this class.\nIt is important to mention that we didn't have our final exam yet (its cumulative ...) but I just had to write here so people who are considering this class for next semester won't register blindly after reading the last few good reviews - because I know some people who take this class right now and would undo it if they could.

Initially, Professor Metcalfe seemed like a sweet lady who was very interested in her subject; some of us referred to her as the (pre stock fraud) Martha Stewart of psychology.\nIt's hard to say whether or not I would recommend this course. I do know that this woman in NO way deserves a silver nugget. Ultimately, there was some incredibly interesting material to be learned, but her lectures were so tangential, sporadic, and inconsistent in speed that it was difficult to encode any memories, which was pretty screwy for a cognition class. The spectrum of testable material ranged from the most incidental comment in lecture to three sentences of a brief passage in the epic Memory text. She zips through her powerpoint slides in lecture and refuses to post them to Courseworks. She also gives sparse exam review documents (that don't cover all the material that she'll put on the test) too close to the date of the exams and her review sessions are solely given by TAs who (with the exception of Jen) are woefully inadequate and nowhere near knowledgeable enough about the material. Even Professor Metcalfe occasionally struggled to find the answer to a student's question, and not just because the field of neuroscience is relatively new.\n\nIf you are prepared to study incredibly hard and read every article and book in depth, you can succeed in this class, and you may find fulfillment. I found many aspects fascinating, but it was so ironic to me that in her quest to have us memorize as much as we could, she stressed us out to an unreasonable, unhealthy level. Literally everyone looked wrecked on test days, I have never seen anything like it. She tests us as though we are not taking 3-5 other academic courses. I have taken some amazingly challenging classes at Columbia; M&S; was stressful to the point of detrimental not because of the caliber of what we were studying, but due to Professor Metcalf's inability to lecture well, the poor organization of the overall course; random, inane selection of tested material; and the disconnect between her TAs policies and grading and her awareness of our performance and knowledge acquisition. One got the sense that she was always off in her lab somewhere, and that she could care less about what we learned or whether we did well in her class. I honestly think she arbitrarily graded our final papers; her TAs could only find about half of our research papers at the end of the year, and the ones that were returned had no comments or useful suggestions for further study.\nBE WARNED: SHE IS HONESTLY THE MOST DISORGANIZED PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER SEEN AT COLUMBIA AND SHE DELEGATES HER RIDICULOUS GRADING POLICIES SOLELY TO HER LACKLUSTER, BLUNDERING TAs. You will likely have to argue with them to get points back on exams, because there is NO curve and their points and deductions never tally up to the total worth of the test. They are also very inconsistent with grading, so definitely bring it up if you and a friend have the same answer but you for some reason did not receive points. It is almost impossible to get a solid A in this class while taking a normal course load and having a life. However, if you can handle the loony, poorly focused and structure lacking class/professor, then you might actually learn some phenomenal information about how the brain works.\n\nWorkload:\n4 midterm exams, one final exam (taken two days before final paper), 15 page final research paper. Extremely heavy reading load (of which you must do all in order to do well).\n"

Plus, much of the class basically teaches you how you remember and LEARN, so I was so glad I took it.  While I was obsessed with Metcalfe, some of my peers were not too fond of her.  I loved the class, wrote down every word she said, and seriously engaged with the material, so I aced the first test.  Then, I knew how to study and how she would test, so I continued and improved on what I was doing.  Many of my peers were caught off guard by her first exam and subsequently didn't enjoy her teaching.  Also, in their defense, she's a little disorganized, so make sure to go back before the test and pull everything together.\nHere are my thoughts on how to ace this class:\n-Try doing the reading before class- don't worry about the details of the experiments, just get the 'gist'\n-Listen in class and get down the MAIN POINTS of what she's saying, and anything you think would be significant to your understanding of the topic (but not stupid details, like background info, experimenter, etc.)  She will usually stress what you have to review_content- review_content between tests (her tests are so close together anyways, so its inevitable)\n- Rehash everything Metcalfe discussed, integrate the readings with your class notes, and pull out the main ideas.  Be fluent in definitions and identifications of the concepts. Do NOT try memorizing, because it will not help you on the test\nHer tests basically ask you to address all the major points in her lecture (and a few from reading).  The time will be a problem if you have to sit there and try remembering- you just need to be fluent.\nI loved her and I strongly recommend this class!\nWorkload:\nFour midterms but a manageable amount of info on each, one paper which is annoying but not super significant, and a final which was way trickier than we expected.

            "review_content": "\nMetcalfe is great. The topics she discusses in class are interesting and relevant. I always looked forward to class. Just be prepared because the class is HARD. It is hard, but not impossible. After bombing the first test, I figured out how to get straight As on the tests. So don't make my mistake (it was nearly impossible for me to get an A after the first test) and read what I have to say. \nFirst, you have to come to EVERY lecture. She covers topics in lectures that are not in the readings and she does not post her power points. You also have to pay attention and take fairly compulsive notes. \nSecond, you have to do your readings. This class does NOT have much homework. The readings total will not take more than 20 hours over the course of the term. Just get them done before the tests because inevitably there will be one or two questions from the readings that she has not covered in class.\nNow  to the test and I will explain why it is necessary to do all the work I just discussed. Before the test, she sends out a list of terms roughly about 50 to 100 terms depending on the test. You need to have a SOLID understanding of every term. For the first test, I defined about 95% of the terms. I thought I would be fine given my past experiences in psychology classes at Columbia. On the first test, there were two terms that I didn't know. That doesn't seem terrible and if this was Science of Psych I would be looking at an A- or something. The reason it matters is because her tests are out of 20 points with point value on questions ranging from 1 to 3. Because the two terms I didn't know were worth 2 points on the test, I was already looking at B-.  Then I got more off for not answering questions with all the information they wanted. \nBecause the tests are short, you have to know absolutely everything on them. Get more than two wrong and you are solidly in the B range. Plus, they are very strict on the grading. If you know everything, it is likely that you will get a point or two off just for not having exactly what they want. On top of that, she tends to throw in about one term that relates to the term list, but not in an obvious way. Try to get clarification from her, but its not likely to help. Thus, you need to know everything and write down everything you know to get the best score. \nNext: how to know everything. After going to every class and doing the readings, I would still be unsure about a number of terms on the list. Usually this was because I wasn't able to keep up with her pace at lectures (she goes really fast sometimes and can be slightly unclear). Do the best from the information you have and then go to the review session to figure out the rest. The TAs will explain everything that you don't know if you ask them. You just need to be proactive and make sure to get your questions out there (its not hard, they were really helpful). The memorize that term list before the test and you are set. \nThe essay was kind of the enigma of the term. A class of about 80 students turned in 10+ page research papers. She had them graded within 24 hours. We are not sure how she did that, but most students got the impression that she didn't really read them (maybe she is just super fast?). Anyways, everyone I spoke to got a 13/15 regardless of how much time they spent on it. So I guess just think of the essay as another few points off your total score.\nBy the time you take the final, you will have everything defined and ready to just cram into your mind. Spend a few hours reviewing everything again to make sure it stuck. Her methods do make the knowledge stick though. I think I will remember most of this material for a long time. \n\nWorkload:\nHere is how it gets calculated: 3 tests worth 20 points each, 10 page research paper worth 15 points, and a final worth 25 points for a total of 100 points. Oh and she doesn't curve, even though our class average appeared to be in the C range, based on the first 3 test scores at least (I don't know the paper or final average). \nThe class is worth it and what I described does not take too much time. Attending lectures, doing 20 hours worth of reading over the term, going to 3 review sessions,  and doing maybe 10 hours of studying for each test is not bad for a Columbia class.\n"

Also the TAs are ignorant to the subject matter and are completely disorganized and they never communicate neccesary information to the students on time.\nWorkload:\nNot too much weekly, but you have to do all of the reading and review sheets the night before the test because that's when the professor posts the materials.\n"

I also definitely have a better idea of how to study for exams. \nUnfortunately, she doesn't believe in posting her ppt presentations on courseworks (because she doesn't think we'd go to class/ pay attention in class, if she did that). Perhaps she has a point, however, it was quite frustrating to try to get notes from other people at the end of class, as no one was quite able to jot down everything.\nWorkload:\n3 MT, 1 research paper (you pick the topic) and a final. Definitely possible to do well as the exams are very straight forward--but you've got to know your stuff!\n"

A lot of the time that we discussed ground-breaking patients, she had her own anecdotes about working with them.\n  The Exams are not as crazy as some have made them seem.  You are required to really understand what she teaches.  Sometimes she is unclear in explaining experimental designs, but she posts all the papers, and they are pretty easy to follow.\nOne person cited the difficulty in not being able to tell the difference between \"knowing\" and \"remembering.\"  This is very well explained, and should be very clear, especially if you took Mind, Brain, and Behavior.\nI know several people who got A+'s on her exams, so they are clearly not impossible.  She is very engaging, and very interested in student's comments.  This class will be very difficult for people who do not show up at lectures, and do not do the reading, as she is a stickler for details.  But the subject matter is inherently invested in the details of experiments and theories, so it makes sense, and is not unreasonable.\nWorkload:\n3 or 4 tests, and a final paper.  Weekly readings are fascinating and even enjoyable.\n"

            "review_content": "\nMetcalfe, from what I've garnered, has long had a problem with her TAs. As per my experience with this class, the rumors certainly seem to be true. I did above-average on all three tests, the final, and the paper. Her TAs, however, did not aid the process at all: they knew nothing at review sessions and graded fairly arbitrarily (usually after a test half the class would be able to score a few points back from Metcalfe and override the TAs). It was frustrating, to say least. The professor is the only one who grades your final paper, though. She's not great about returning your stuff; she lost my third test and she left my final paper in a hotel in Arizona. Didn't seem too bothered by it either. Go figure.\nAside from that: she goes quickly through the powerpoint presentations (don't try and skip class and get them through courseworks-- they are so insubstantial that you'd just be wasting your time looking at one word slides, really). She's very enthusiastic, a little strange sometimes, and can get sidetracked easily; just PRAY you don't have some snooty guy or girl who wants to get in a battle of the minds with her, because class will come to a screeching halt. \nMy feeling altogether? As a freshman who has taken only summer and high school psych classes, I managed to wing an A- overall... so don't worry. Just work hard and enjoy it; you learn a lot of cool stuff if you want to.\nWorkload:\nThere is a lot of reading that I found to be interesting and well-written; I didn't read the experiments in great detail and still found myself doing well in the class. Tests: all I can say is study your ass off. Outline off the \"cheat sheet\" (review sheets) that she gives you. Put a good amount of effort in your final paper; talk to her about it if you're unsure of what to do.\n"

Beware the senior psych majors who will help blow the curve.\nWorkload:\nMajor workload. 3 next-to-impossible tests, graded by the pickiest TAs on earth. Also, a 15-page paper graded harshly and somewhat arbitrarily--you might thing your paper is great, but there were definately a ton of Ds and Cs given on the paper.

But about the class--it is a detailed overview of how the memory works from a cognition perspective (brain function). Tons of interesting case studies, and a lot of stuff about repressed memory (if you want to go into law this is a good class to take). All the info is VERY current. Her lectures are clear and build upon each other. She also encourages class participation, which in a lecture is really cool. While she is a great teacher, she is a harsh grader. On the paper, when she says a magazine article she means one that is worthy to be published in the New Yorker--and don't use chatty language. She means well but can be mean sometimes.\nWorkload:\nNot too much reading but watch out for tests! 3 during the semester plus a final! and even though they look easy, mess up on three questions and you are at the class mean (which is a C). She tests random facts, forcing you to memorize EVERYTHING. There is also an 8 page paper--turn in a rough draft and you will do fine, you don't and you could wind up failing. do to the random tests, i suggest taking it pass fail (though you will still have to work) because its a great class but can play havok on your gpa.\n"
