            "review_content": "\nThis is for the flipped classroom in fall 2014. We were assigned small (10-15 person) sections, and each week had about 60-90 minutes of coursera videos to watch before hand. At the session he would spend 20 minutes recapping the key points from the videos, then maybe 30 minutes we'd be doing questions (very similar to the exam questions), and discussing the answers with him. Lots of opportunities to ask questions and talk with him, especially if you get a less crowded session. (Note that his original plan was that he'd only do 2 of every 3 weeks for each section, and a TA would do the other. However it seemed like he abandoned this after a while, and combined a few sessions so he could do all of them himself.)\nI really enjoyed the format. Keeping up with the lectures before your session was a bit difficult when you have a million other things to do, but pretty important. I fell behind about 3/4ths through when we switched away from machine translation, and it took me a while to catch up again. It was also a little disappointing that you almost never saw who else was in the class, since a bit of discussion about the homework with other students was quite valuable. \nThere is no textbook, but he has a set of classnotes online that's basically an alpha version of a textbook, along with the slides he used in the coursera video.\nThe biggest issue I had with the class was general non-responsiveness on Piazza. There were a LOT of questions about the assignments, and the TAs just generally didn't respond. The TA led discussion sections were also basically useless for me, although the TAs also seemed nice and were trying hard, they just weren't up to Collins' level. \nWorkload:\n5 homeworks. Each was split into an analytical and a coding section. The analytical weren't too bad, but the coding was quite time consuming. You had to implement certain algorithms to produce specific output. There were generally hundreds of tiny bugs you could make that would drive your performance on the task from like 91% to 3%, and it often felt like a bug hunting exercise. Starting early enough that you have an intelligent design for your system is highly recommended, since you'll generally iterate on part1 in part2. Each one was probably 10-20 hours of coding.\nmidterm + final, both of which were quite doable. However, the types of questions he asks are mostly of the \"do something with a toy grammar\" type that you're asked in the flipped classrooms. Which means that often understanding the bigger picture is less important that seeing the tricks in the toy examples. Still, with the flipped classroom exercises + cheat sheet, you should do ok on the exams. \n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Collins did a flipped classroom format this semester, and I learned more in this class than I've ever learned in any other upper level CS class. I enjoyed the class and I'd recommend it. I also wish that every CS professor would switch to flipped classroom.\nEvery week, he assigned about an hour and a half of video lectures from Coursera. These lectures are incredibly clear and the great thing about them being online is that you can watch them 80 times over until you understand the material. I usually space out during CS lectures, so this was invaluable for me. Then you attend a weekly (~10 people) discussion session where you do problems taken from previous exams. This was more like him handing out the questions, everyone staring blankly at them for a few minutes, and him explaining the answers. Repeat for an hour. These discussions were led by him and the TAs, and they usually felt awkward, but they were useful. They were supposed to be mandatory but he stopped taking UNIs after a few weeks, and I don't think they really ended up being mandatory. Toward the end of the semester, a lot of people stopped going. He posted textbook style notes about the lectures as well as classroom questions and solutions online after each week.\nAs someone whose programming skills were rusty and mediocre at best, I found the homework to be challenging but not at all impossible. I recommend using Python, and if you don't know it, it will be easy to learn. For the programming, you're literally just implementing the algorithms that you learned in class, so it's not so much thinking about how to solve the problems as it is deciding what data structures to use and being careful with your code. They were sometimes unusually time consuming though.\nThe TAs were usually pretty helping during office hours, and not as helpful on Piazza. Prof Collins did not hold office hours, and he explained that the flipped classroom would be the time for office hour questions.\nDefinitely come in with solid knowledge of probability. You'll need a little bit of calc and linear algebra toward the end. Which really means if (1) you can take a derivative, and (2) you know what a vector is and how to take a dot product, you'll be fine.\nWorkload:\nweekly online lectures (1-1.5 hours), weekly discussion section (1 hour)\n4 homeworks (35%) - each had a theory part and programming part, due separately\n1 midterm (25%), 1 cumulative final (40%)\n"

            "review_content": "\nKnowledgeable? Yes. Approachable? Yes. Nice? Absolutely. A good instructor? Hell no.\nProf. Collins definitely knows his stuff. However, he has troubles conveying it to his students. Admittedly, I'm not very good at prob/stats, and this course is full of probability. However, it is not a sign of a good professor when you're really excited to be there on day one but feel utter despair on your way out. My friend and I went to almost every single lecture but felt behind everyday.\nAlso, there were three assignments the entire term. Usually this would be a good thing. However, because you did not understand what was going on in lectures, we at least needed some kind of practice for the midterms (called quizzes because he's British or something). Alas, no assignment was released before the second midterm, and it absolutely pooped on us.\nHopefully, this cluttered and unorganized class will get better as Collins gets more and more experience teaching. However, if you can, try to take it with Prof. Hirschberg or someone who can actually make you understand.\nWorkload:\n3 HWs (5 were expected in the beginning)\n2 Midterms\n1 Final\n"

            "review_content": "\nYou know you're taking a class on a different level when you're doing homework and whenever you Google for help, your own damn professor's slides and research papers are the top (and sometimes only) results. \nYou know from that that Michael Collins is obviously a brilliant man and has made a huge impact on NLP research, but he's also a great lecturer and professor. He explains topics thoroughly and thoughtfully and takes time during class to answer all questions. He'll give printouts of slides to you as well as post them online. (The slides themselves are really only meant to supplement his lecture though\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere are some classes where the slides are a good substitute for in-class notes; this is not the case here.) For some of the bigger topics (part of speech tagging, machine translation, etc.) he'll also type up his own notes that cover the subject pretty well. Overall an approachable and friendly guy. \nAs for the course itself, like a previous reviewer said, Collins definitely brings some rigor to a class that is generally within Julia Hirschberg's realm of teaching. The class felt like applied machine learning at times, and you were at an advantage if you've taken some sort of ML before, and a strong foundation in statistics is important to really understand what's going on. The average on some assignments and quizzes were really low (a third of the class got less than 50% on the second quiz), but the class is curved. The tests were a mix of applying basic knowledge on a topic and adapting algorithms learned in class to some unique situation. The analytical part of the homeworks were generally in a similar spirit. Grading was a bit harsh at first but seemed to let up towards the end. \nIf you know 1) your stats and/or 2) have taken some ML before and 3) want to learn NLP from one of the top people in the field, there's no question you should take this class. If you just want to do #3, it'll take you a little more effort, but you'll probably muddle your way through like the rest of us. If none of these sound interesting, there are better classes out there for you, friend.\n\nWorkload:\n2 quizzes, 1 final.\n3 homeworks, seemingly released at the TAs' whims. All had analytical parts, first 2 had programming. On par with what you'd expect from this style of course. \nProgramming wasn't necessarily difficult, but sometimes it's hard to debug when you're working with a decent-sized corpus and your entire program takes minutes, if not hours, to run. If you ask, the TAs should release how long each program should take to run (generally < 5min), but everything's language-dependent anyway so that's only slightly useful. \n"

            "review_content": "\nAn enjoyable, informative, and (really, really) laid-back class. Like the title suggests, it's about ML applications to NLP, but since just about every machine learning model anyone's come up with has been used for NLP at some point, it tends to focus on problems Collins himself has worked on or is working on now. This is obviously a Good Thing: he was obviously excited about most of the material in the class (I don't think I've ever heard the phrase \"fun algorithm\" used more or with such earnestness) and made it exciting to learn as well.\nHe's a phenomenally clear lecturer---I took this class concurrently with ML, and the contrast between Collins' presentations and Jebara's insane ramblings couldn't be clearer. I'd encountered a couple of the models we talked about in this class before and struggled with them; MC made everything effortlessly comprehensible. The slides are also good enough that you can get away with skipping the assigned papers (though you really shouldn't; I stopped after about two weeks but am hoping to catch up during the summer).\nAt times it felt like half the department was taking the class; other days there were only five people there. Obviously he's a big fuckin' deal, and just about everyone in the NLP group, faculty included, showed up at some point to watch the man himself teach. I'm still not sure how many people there were auditors rather than enrolled students. That said, both he and Vinod were very accessible during OO and by email.\nI'm pleased to see that he's teaching NLP next fall---he'll bring some much-needed rigor to Hirschberg's class (which is well-intentioned but a little fuzzy around the edges). I really enjoyed this semester and hope I have the opportunity to take something else with him again before I graduate.\nWorkload:\nRemarkably, at times disturbingly, little. Two problem sets, both assigned near the end of the course and requiring more time to typeset in LaTeX than they did to solve. The main event is the final project, but even that is pretty low-key: the writeup is only six pages long if you're working by yourself, and Vinod seemed surprised when I gave him something in the form of a journal article rather than a lab report.\nI don't know if MIT students are all crybabies, or if Collins feels compelled to dumb himself down for us (I hope it's the former); either way, don't let the 6 in front of the course number fool you into thinking that the material will make you sweat.\n"
