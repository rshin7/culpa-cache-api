He shows up prepared for each recitation with a list of the important topics of the week, reviews those topics in terms that students can understand, and solves examples of the same level as the exams. At the end of each recitation, the students usually leave with a good understanding of the topics of the week.\nOutside of class, Yinghua is easily accessible by email or through his office hours. He'll usually not only answer your questions but make sure you understand the entire problem.\nIf you get Yinghua as a TA, and you are willing to spend the time going to recitations and asking questions, then you should have no problems both learning the material and doing well in the course.\n"
