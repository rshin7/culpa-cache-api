            "review_content": "\nArman is a fantastic teacher. Though he can be overly energetic (which was sometimes hard at 10 in the morning), he is one of those rare teachers that is actually deeply passionate about the subject matter and about his students. Our class had a really fantastic dynamic that he facilitated well, and he always brought really engaging pieces for us to analyze and questions for us to think about. He gives great feedback on assignments and is generally an easy grader. Even though I am music major and thus knew a lot of the material already, he had a way of catering to each student to make everyone feel engaged, involved, and important. This is something that is often hard to find at Columbia, and I think that Arman does a truly wonderful job of it. I have no bad feedback about him at all.\nWorkload:\nListening to each piece before the next class and coming prepared to discuss it. 3 or 4 short assignments scattered throughout the semester. 3 concert reports based on concerts that he took us to that are 4-5 pages. His assignments tend to be vague, so just make sure that you pay attention during the concerts and in class for the short assignments. Take-home final. \n"
