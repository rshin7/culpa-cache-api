It's true that he talks about the children aka the cats a lot and words the problem sets/exams in vague ways that can require online searching because we did not cover it class. He uses Piazza to clear up wording, but doesn't always actually bridge the gap and requires you to go to TA's office hours to make sure you ace the problem sets. I scored on the average for the first midterm mostly because I couldn't understand what was being asked of the question. Luckily the second midterm and final were made into take home exams and actually helped me in learning a lot trying to answer them because it become a research project about interesting Economic topics like the Water-Diamond Paradox. Just another thing that was not covered in class but I was fortunate enough to stumble upon online. On the positive he send the class weekly email blasts about what will be covered in class, recitation, and weekly times articles that are on current events regarding the upcoming lesson plans. He brings a good sense of humor to class and if you sit up front you can get some good dialogue with him to clear up things. This kid Salim sat up front and wouldn't stop raising his hand to asks questions. Although sometimes annoying he did ask some good questions and make some of the more boring lectures a bit less of a snore fest. Overall, the class was enjoyable and didn't hurt my GPA like I heard Gulatti would, nor was it hard to understand because of a thick accent like other Econ professors.\nWorkload:\nSee TA's from Problem sets that are about one every 1-2 wks and you will ACE\n1st midterm is harder than the take home midterm and Final but possible to Ace if you devote 8-12 hours on each. He gave us 47 hours to complete each take home.\n"

If I could turn back the clock and take a different professor, I would do so. I have never met a more inarticulate, Harvard Ph.D in my entire life. His lectures can be interesting and occasionally humorous, but he will put you to sleep.\nMy biggest concern: His problem sets. He is absolutely horrible at phrasing questions and letting you know what he wants you to include in your answer. He lets you use Piazza to ask questions, but his advanced age is evident in his use of the website. His internet grammar makes the average YouTube troll look like an articulate, well-informed member of society. And the way he answers questions on Piazza is cryptic and makes just as much \"sense\" as the question he asked in the first place.\nPro: Because his problem sets are absolute bullshit, they're easy to knock out in a few hours if you use Google, but good luck getting the same results on the test. He will justify any grading mistakes he makes in the most ridiculous way possible.\nHe doesn't shut up about his cats.\nWorkload:\nNot that much work, but the problem sets can be frustratingly stupid.\nOne regular midterm \nOne take-home midterm\nOne final\n"

He basically prides himself on being an intellectual iconoclast, so much of the course focuses on disambiguating students of their previous \"common sense\" beliefs. Unfortunately, he goes about this in a very confusing manner. Generally, he will make some sort outrageously counterintuitive statement, causing students to miss his subsequent explanation because they are too busy checking with their neighbor to make sure they actually heard him correctly. His class promises much, and by the end it does start to deliver, but not without a great deal of frustration in the beginning of the semester. \nIn terms of grading, the strangeness only continues. Basically, your grade in his class has close to zero correlation with the amount of work you put in. I, for example, put basically no effort into his class, other than showing up for ~70% of the lectures. I walked into the exam with no knowledge of vast sections of the material, but he put a question on the test that involved using a uniform probability distribution (this was never covered in any material prior to the exam, and the question itself required no knowledge of the course material, just the ability to understand how to use uniform probability distributions). Since the rest of the exam (and the class) was so easy, this one question basically became the curve, so I got an A while many other students who put more effort in than me likely got lower grades. \nBasically, take this class if you are smart and confident in your ability to handle unexpected situations. Everyone takes it, so the main advantage in my mind is that you will have lots of friends with whom to work on problem sets. \nWorkload:\n4 problem sets (at least two of them involve copious and unnecessary amounts of math), midterm (easy), choice of a paper and easy final, or no paper and hard final\n"

First of all, there is very little economics actually taught and you will probably not be as prepared for higher levels of economics as those who had other Principles professors.  Instead of focusing on basic economics, Professor O'Flaherty would much rather espouse his views on healthcare, oil, or a variety of other issues.  While this could be interesting to provide examples of economic principles or as a sidenote, those random thoughts of Professor O'Flaherty are the main focus.  Also, O'Flaherty does not use the textbook at all.  Instead, he provides 7 problems sets which are some of the most bizzare assignments I have ever been given as a student.  The problems are exceedingly strange (as Professor O'Flaherty's examples tend to be) and it is very hard to determine what he is looking for on each one.  Additionally, they are seemingly arbitrarily graded by the TA's and really don't matter at all in determining your final grade.  The exams are almost as bizzare as the problem sets, filled with made up planets, jokes about his cats, and other truly strange situations and questions.  Again, the tests were seemingly arbitrarily graded by TA's, and for the midterm, Professor O'Flaherty initially refused to explain what the raw score correlated to in terms of grade, and would only tell us the mean and median score.\nSection is slightly better, as the TA's attempt to get some economics into the course.  Mine, however, was pretty unknowledgable and did not deal with questions about the material well.  Also, they are not terribly useful in attempting to navigate the course, as they find Professor O'Flaherty's teaching style and the course overall as strange and erratic as the students do.  \nOverall, the course is terrible.  O'Flaherty's teaching style is bizzare and pretty uninformative with regards to the Principles of Economics.  If you have to take Principles as a requirement and can't get another professor, take it Pass/Fail, which you can as your first course if you are an Economics major.  That way you hedge against how erratic and unpredictable the course is and can always uncover the grade if you do well.\nWorkload:\n*7 problem sets\n*Midterm\n*Final\n"

But mostly, his lectures, with exceptions, are interesting and filled with very dry, subtle humor. And if he makes mistakes, he always follows up by e-mail.  \nYes, he talks about penguins and pet food a lot. But maybe it's because this is a PRINCIPLES of economics course. He uses very abstract examples so that you actually have to think about the concepts and mechanisms at work there. If you spend some time thinking about the problem sets, you shouldn't have any problems. And if you do, you can always ask the TAs or O'Flaherty directly. The sets are graded check, check plus anyway so it's not even such a big deal.\nIf you think about majoring in econ, this class will definitely help you a lot if you're willing to think abstractly about stuff.

I'd say you could do one of the two: read the book, or strain to listen to what he's saying and take copious notes.  What wasn't good was the questions in the book for the problem sets--they usually had no real answer and/or didn't relate very well to the corresponding chapter.  For example, there would be questions at the end of the chapter involving math formulas, when no formulas were given and no math was discussed in the chapter.\nThe T.A. was a character in himself--trying to steal the show, but he often didn't know what he was talking about.  But since he did the grading, it was very useful to have him know your name, and in a positive way.\nAs for me, for what it's worth, I went to class & listened, didn't read much of the book, didn't do the optional 15-page paper, but still got an A.

Why is this a requirement for Economics majors anyway?

Take that as a hypo-test.  If it sounds boring to you, than no subject matter is going to make a clas with this teacher worthwhile.  If, on the other hand, using economics in this capacity piques your interest, then it is worth trying out a class with O'Flaherty.  I have several friends who have took Principles with me, and our opinions of Dan seem to split exactly on this example.\nEconomics of Race is taught less like a standard college course and more like a British university class.  Extensive literature is made available (far more than could be read during the semeser, approximately 5-6 big course packets).  Professor O'Flaherty lectures on the most important studies in various fields, but gives the students free play on what they choose to study.  The midterm is short and extremely objective, consiting largely of multiple choice and short answer questions.  I disagree with earlier reveiw that said the test was obtruse; I could find verbatim answers to each of the questions listed somewhere in my notes.  The final is the same format.  There is also an optional paper; those that choose the paper are given a shorter, simpler final (basically, to make sure you still come to class).  The whole point of a class taught in this format is personal research, so it seems kind of a waste to enroll and not right a paper.  Still, if you're one of those people that hates O'Flaherty and are still stuck in his class, just camp in the back and take detailed notes- they'll pay off for the final.\nWorkload:\nMidterm, final/final paper, a few short homework assignments, extensive optional reading assignments\n"

I had no idea what to expect at the beginning of this class, but having finished, I would recommend this class to everyone.  \nWorkload:\n3 problem sets, an easy midterm and your choice of an easy final or really easy final if you write a paper\n"

            "review_content": "\nThe first class, he started talking about short people.  The second class, he played country music at the end of lecture.  He's definitely a quirky guy.  I'm sure he'd be interesting to talk to, but the lectures bored me to death.  I stopped going after the second week.  Sometime in the second half of the semester, I started feeling guilty, so decided to give him another chance.  Admittedly, the lecture had more content and was kind of interesting, but still was not enough to convince me to go.  The last few, where he gets on tangents sometime, are okay.\nRecitations are required, and one problem with that is GRADE DISTRIBUTION IS THE SAME WITHIN EACH SECTION.  This means if you're stuck with 2 or 3 dorks who make econ their ENTIRE life, it'll be hard to get a top mark.  This doesn't mean the class is hard though; reading the textbook and going to recitation should be enough.  Just go to the very last lecture, where he makes a list of all the topics that are on the exam.  People ask, and he goes over, just about every topic that's not in the book.\nAnother warning, if you want to continue in Econ, this might not be the right intro class to take.  Significantly less material is covered compared to other Principles classes.  This makes for an easier class, but you're put at a disadvantage later on because you have to learn concepts other people have seen before.  Dan's philosophy is to teach this class assuming that most people won't take another intro class, so he wants to 'instill you with an appreciation of econ' or something, but doesn't expect you to major in it.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets, midterm and final.  All easy.\n"

The material was pretty basic, with many students knowing most of it from high school economics, but O'Flaherty avoided being boring by focusing on real life implications of concepts, rather than on dry technical definitions. The class does see the supply and demand graphs a few too many times, but perhaps the emphasis is warranted.\nWorkload:\nSimple problems sets every other week or so handed in at recitation. The tests were relatively easy, and each student was allowed one sheet of notes.\n"

The recitations would be helpful if I didnt feel like something new was taught everytime.  The readings, the lectures, and the recitations all seemed to cover three somewhat similar but yet very different topics.   I still dont understand the grading system but i dont think it matters much.  I didnt do great on the midterm and the final I found very hard (and can't imagine I did well on) yet my grade was rather good.  I think this is a class where 'things just work out in the end\" .  Warning though if all this info is new to you, you may be a bit screwed; most of the students have already taken econ in some form (high school.. another class etc...) and it seems your graded based on your rank within your recitation.  So find a recitation with the fewest amount of students who already know their stuff ( they're easy to spot they'll be the ones arguing wih the TA's on the first day of class, and constantly asking questions with no relevence to the material) and you shouldn't do to bad.\nWorkload:\nIs an intro course so if you've already taken econ... sleep through it... if not your gonna have alot to study if your really want to learn the material.\n"
