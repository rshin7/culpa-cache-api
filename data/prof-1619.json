Someimtes, however, i felt like he was taking it a bit too easy with us, and it hurt in terms of learning things like vocabulary. \nIn sum, I would definitely take him again\nWorkload:\nStandardized by department - daily homework, one test every two weeks.  essays once in a while. no midterm, yes final.  it is 4 points, but not overwhelming\n"
