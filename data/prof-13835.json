Classes also boring af\nShe has a very set view of how people should write which didn't set the way I was used to writing before. \nI have literally published papers and stuff but I still got a B. \nIts the only B I've ever got. \nPretty much no one got above a B+ in our class. \nI'm actually quite angry cos she has ruined my GPA. \nHer justification is: \"I make it really hard to give As because potentially everyone can do better.\"\nThat the same with every class - she needs to chill with the grading. It's supposed to be a core class!\nAvoid at all costs if you can!\n\nWorkload:\nStandard UW\n"

I love how I feel so inspired to write after meeting with her because she is just that helpful. If I go into the meeting unsure with what I am going to write about for the upcoming essay, I leave with a concrete idea I feel confident with. She also gives really useful feedback and will even directly help you revise specific sections as practice. As a plus, she doesn't make you do discussion posts or anything. Very manageable workload. \nWorkload:\nA couple readings, listening to podcasts, brainstorming, exploratory draft, formal draft, and final draft. (for each progression)\n"
