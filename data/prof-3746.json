You just have to make sure you don't take your midterm lightly it's a very challenging test also strt the paper a bit early and make sure you ask dr wind any questions you have. He's very approachable and a plain cool guy. A lot of material is taught but it's not hard the homeworks won't prepare you for the midterm!! your going to have to keep on top of the material but make no mistake this is a great course\nWorkload:\nA lot of material is taught but it's not hard the homeworks won't prepare you for the midterm!! your going to have to keep on top of the material but make no mistake this is a great course\n"

He gives fair exams, but makes you learn a LOT to do well on them. \nWorkload:\nEasy-Fair for 6000 level since more qualitative than quantitative\n"
