There's a weekly lab that's scheduled for 3 hours, but generally you'll finish after 1-2. The homework is reasonable, as well. There are 3 \"midterms\", all of which are reasonable and are on a decentreview_content. review_content the previous years' midterms, as the ones he gives are of nearly the same format.\nWorkload:\n3 relatively easy midterms, reasonable weekly homework, a weekly lab (lab assigments are required to be finished in the lab, so there's really no extra homework there), and a curved, harder final\n"
