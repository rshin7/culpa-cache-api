I mean it was so bad he became a total laughing stock among the people in the class - he just did not get that just because he knows yiddish fluently, people who have been learning for just a few weeks do not. \nThe midterm, thankfully a take home, was a total disaster since he felt he could ask about anything and everything that he obviously did not teach in class. He redeemed himself a bit by making the final easier since he knew we all hated him but whatever you do, take this class with Hoffman at all costs. If you cant, dont take the class.\nWorkload:\nnightly homeworks, take home midterm, take home final\n"
