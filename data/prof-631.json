            "review_content": "\nTake a seminar with Prof. Davidson! I really, really enjoyed this class -- Davidson is awesome and the syllabus was fun. Davidson is funny, kind, really understanding, etc., plus really smart and obviously knows her shit. She's kind of quirky in a fun way, very down to earth.\nI really liked the way she ran seminars -- she had the perfect blend of her own voice plus class discussion. One of my least favorite things about seminars is that sometimes they can become entirely student-run and you don't hear the professor's voice at all, which sucks because a lot of times you take a seminar with a really great/well-known/smart/etc. prof and then they don't say anything during class. The good news is this doesn't happen in this seminar! She doesn't really ever lecture, she will contextualize the text in the first 15 minutes or so of class if we're on a new text but she's really good at guiding discussion, asking good questions, and then sort of providing her own thoughts/in-class feedback throughout the discussion. Not sure I'm describing this properly but I think what I want to say is basically that she's good at being part of the discussion, instead of simply observing and calling on people and letting things sort of run their own course. \nThe syllabus was really enjoyable. It's an 18th century class, and I didn't know what to expect since European is pretty wide-spanning, but I really loved some of the readings. Even those works we didn't read the entire thing of (she was pretty understanding and didn't assign absurd amounts of reading, pointed out passages of Pamela that we should definitely read if we ran out of time and couldn't read the whole thing, etc.) I feel like I learned a lot from, about the history of the novel, about how novels evolved, and about the writers/works themselves. The supplementary readings when provided were really helpful in guiding this understanding. Some fun ones from the syllabus: Jacques the Fatalist, Sorrows of Young Werther, Princess de Cleves, Dangerous Liaisons, couple others... none of them are really about the same thing at all which is fun. \nTake this class, if you can. If you can't, take another with Davidson, she's great. \nWorkload:\nWe had a text a week generally speaking, or sometimes two weeks depending how long it was. Reading was manageable but by no means light.\nFour assignments throughout the semester, with guided topics for the first three, plus a final writing assignment. I think the first three were like 3-5 pages, and then the last one slightly longer, maybe 5-7 or 6-8. No grades on any of the assignments, just comments, which is sort of nerve-wracking but grading was pretty fair/standard for an English class.\nPretty low stress class, I think really because Prof. Davidson is such a cool person.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nFabulous class, taught by a professor who genuinely loves her material and wants her students to appreciate it as much as she does. Even if you think Pamela, for all its literary significance, is not something you should actually bother to read, and you suspect you're not up to puzzling out Tristram Shandy, or whatever, just take the class. She didn't force us to slog through every last page of Pamela, and I found it surprisingly rewarding to examine it as a text as opposed to talking about it in the abstract as I have in other English classes. You don't have to read all of Tristram Shandy either, though hopefully you will want to, and she walked the class through some of the more abstruse passages.\nShe takes the time to give us a full sense of historical context for these works, making the class very accessible. If you're already well-versed in European history, you'll just have to sit tight for a little while she explains who Bonnie Prince Charlie is, etc., but don't get too full of yourself, since you almost certainly won't understand every reference in the books on this syllabus, and you'll appreciate her explanations when you find yourself lost. \nShe does a lot of interactive close reading in her lectures, and I would have preferred less of it, but I'm just one of those people who gets burnt out on close reading quickly and prefers overall critical reflection on a work. \nThe written assignments she had us do in lieu of a final paper at the end of the semester were highly enjoyable--I often found myself wishing I could write more than two pages!\nProfessor Davidson has got to be one of the kindest and most enthusiastic professors in the English Department, and at Columbia as a whole. She is extremely intelligent and articulate, but manages to be completely down-to-earth. She is not patronizing or pretentious but also does not dumb anything down, does not play games or favorites, and overall just wants her students to enjoy and understand her curriculum. She has a rare touch, certainly deserves her silver nugget, and will someday I hope be bumped up to gold. This class was relaxing, informative, and all-around a lovely way to spend Monday and Wednesday mornings.\nWorkload:\nNormal/light (may depend on how easy you find moving through things like Tom Jones and Tristram Shandy; if you're a slow reader with a lot of other classes you'll probably be a little apprehensive about the per-week page counts)\nThe reading (which can be daunting if it's a more challenging book, but is completely doable/reasonable), five written assignments (informal--not like essays, but you have to be arguing or discussing something coherently over the course of two pages) and a take-home essay final intended to take us three hours to write. There is often a choice of topic for the written assignments, and she assigns more than you actually have to write, so that you have flexibility in deciding when and how to fulfill your five assignment requirement. You return them all at the end (preferably the ones she commented on, as opposed to fresh copies, so hang on to them) in a portfolio.\n"

She talks of History of the Plague Year as the first apocalyptic English novel. She is so incredibly intelligent and even though sometimes her questions range from \"What is a simile\" to identifying the origin of a random boxing reference, she steers the class well in identifying various narrative structures and techniques and illustrating the evolution of narration in novels. \nBooks: \nA Journal of the Plague Year\nPamela\nThe History of Tom Jones, A Foundling\nThe Life and Opinions of Trisham Shandy\nEvelina\nPersuasion \nWorkload:\nFive out of six or seven suggested two-page max \"thought pieces\" on narrative techniques used in the novels. She's very open about do-your-own paper topics; I ended up writing one comparing comedic structures in Tom Jones and How I Met Your Mother. \nOne take-home final paper that isn't supposed to take longer than three hours. \n"

Professor Davidson knows so very, very much. I feel like I've read the best novel ever written in English.  It surprised me that I was seldom bored during the 1,500 pages of this enormous book. My brain feels oddly... complete. \nI highly recommend the class; I haven't received any marks yet, so I can't speak to how it's graded... papers receive comments, but no check-plus or -minus or anything. Whatever grade I end up with, it was worth it. I don't say that very often.\nWorkload:\nCall it 160 pages a week, of the world's hugest book. We had two weeks without reading assignments, in case we needed catch-up time. \nYou will want to do the readings, there's obviously little point to the class otherwise. \nNo weekly reflections. One critical precis of a secondary source. One longer final paper, 10-12 pages.  \n"

Her lectures are fascinating by tying in historical developments with the reading material, along with anecdotes about 18th century life and literature. She focuses a lot on dissecting the nuances of sentences to figure out how they operate to produce a particular effect in the reader, which will hone your reading skills by the end of the semester. \nShe's also really nice and cool, though pretty disorganized (she loses things and her comments were a bit last-minute). \nThe only drawback to her style is she wanted to create class discussion during every class, which was predictably difficult in a 60-person lecture. The same people ended up speaking every class, and there were often lots of awkward pauses and gaps. But overall it was a good semester and I'd recommend her to any English major -- you'll learn a lot and form a good relationship. \n\nWorkload:\nFour (initially ungraded) short papers throughout the semester, midterm that draws directly from the lectures, and straightforward take-home final. You can easily get away with not doing many of the readings, but with the amount Prof. Davidson can teach it's not worth it. \n"

The material is light, especially considering that it's a pre-1800--themes include male manners, marriage, disguise/mistaken identity, town/country, social class--the plays don't take long to read, although they will probably all blur together by the end of the semester. There is also a unit on theater and acting styles (Garrick, stage technology, Shakespeare adaptations, etc) that is truly unique for an English class. Prof. Davidson is interesting, very enthusiastic, and approachable. She's obviously well-versed in historical background and it's clear that she genuinely enjoys the material. Yes, sometimes she just nods at students' comments without weaving them into a discussion, but overall, she is just so brilliant and insightful and the material so much fun that you can overlook this minor shortcoming. I'd definitely recommend this class--it will give you a good overview of a period you might otherwise ignore, introduce you to an excellent professor, and provide you with some laughs (the plays are genuinely funny at times.)\nWorkload:\n3-5 page paper, 7-10 page final paper, Shakespeare in the 18th century assignment that involves comparing texts on an online database (fascinating!)...Everyone has to post questions on courseworks at least once and participate in class discussions.
