            "review_content": "\nIn short, the entire Biosphere program has been among the best schoolin' I ever received.  Old man Wylie sort of wears the captains hat when it comes to organizing field trips (which are substantial and AWESOME).  He tells a mean story and teaches a guitar seminar after class on the side.  The best part about all of the professors at Bio2 is that you really get the chance to get to know them and pick their brains about anything - ecology, evolution, politics, Bollinger, their childhood mischief, and what the hell to do with your life with a history minor and a lot of student loans.  Too cool.\nWorkload:\nThe Earth Science semester is pretty demanding, but you learn lots and lots, and most of it is taught by people who are really interesting and really care.  Wylie is no exception.  If Columbia doesn't dump this program, and you're at all interested in the management of the planet, get yourself out here.\n"
