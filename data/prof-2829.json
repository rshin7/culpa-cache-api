            "review_content": "\nChristie was a mixed bag.  Generally i liked the class because we had good chemistry, although the six hours could be long at times.  She is laid back, although I was often unsure of whether she completely hated what I was working on.  She was creative and open to new ideas, and even joked around with us sometimes. As a potential visual arts major, I would have to liked to have more feedback and depth in the discussions-everything seemed kind of shallow.  Prentis was a lot of fun, and even if she's not the best teacher ever, the class was definitely worthwhile. \nWorkload:\n6 or so projects. Be prepared to spend a lot of your own time in the studio after class. \n"
