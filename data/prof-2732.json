            "review_content": "\nAn overall good survey of Western art (and of course a necessary requirement for College students). Deborah's teaching style is not didactic, which is appropriate for a class such as art appreciation. She allowed us to engage in discussion without poking holes in anybody's argument -- that she usually left up to other students. The workload was minimal, thus allowing us to appreciate rather than memorize art, though the midterm and final required some memorization. I would venture a guess that this art hum section was one of the easiest, so take it with Deborah at any chance. Unless, of course, you would rather have a dogmatic nutcase teach you.\nWorkload:\nBarely any readings and homework, three short non-research essays, easy midterm, and easy final.\n"
