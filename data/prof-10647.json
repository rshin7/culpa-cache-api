She was extremely responsive to what her students were saying, encouraged discussion, presided over class with a refreshing vibrancy, and always dealt fairly and with a touch of humor. Overall a wonderful person to learn from - if you're looking for a class that will give you the room to explore the world a bit differently, give this a shot.\nWorkload:\nLots and lots of reading, some hard, some downright pleasurable. Two short papers and a longer final one.\n"
