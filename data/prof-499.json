            "review_content": "\nThis woman was an amazing teacher. Unfortunately she seems to be teaching only the first semester of Elementary German this year. Classes are fun, insightful, and meticulously organized. She even brought candy for Halloween! She is willing at any time to make appointments to go over things (in English!) that you have trouble with. The complete immersion in German speaking made the class incredibly frustrating at first, but one can catch on within a few weeks (also use the aforementioned English-friendly office hours). She's also really, really generous about extensions and making up work.\nWorkload:\nDaily homework (anywhere from five minutes to forty-five minutes), short essays every two weeks, tests for every chapter, random short quizzes, midterm, written final, oral final project to be done with a partner.\n"
