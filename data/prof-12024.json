Lectures are extremely interesting (machine politics, national urban policy, fragmentation, etc.). His is easily the best professor in Barnard's political science department. \nDon't be late to lectures! I wish upon no one the shame Scotty Minkoff inflicts on those who are late to class.\nGrade Distribution:\n25%: In-Class Midterm Examination\n30%: In-Class Final Examination\n10%: Discussion Section Attendance and Participation \n15%: Urban Issue Journal\n20%: Urban Issue Policy Memo\nDefinitely take this class!\n\nWorkload:\nthe most reasonable. weekly readings, straightforward midterm and final (nothing unexpected). one memo assignment at the end of the semester. He got his PhD is 2011 so he understands the strug of being a student. \n"
