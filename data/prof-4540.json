            "review_content": "\nProfessor Minot is open-minded and helpful in her critiques. Intro writing workshops can be frustrating because the work tends to be of low quality, but she manages to be helpful without seeming harsh. That said, the course (while an easy one) is irritatingly repetitive and slow. Every week we turned in the same assignments, and each workshop was devoted to critiquing three student stories. Sometimes it was a very long two hours, even for a writer who loves workshops.\nWorkload:\nReview of/response to an assigned reading due every week, along with 2-3 pages of new prose, and page-long critiques of three student stories up for discussion in workshop that week. About every three weeks, you turn in a story for critique/workshop.\n"
