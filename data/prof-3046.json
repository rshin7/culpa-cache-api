            "review_content": "\nDisclaimer: I got an A in the course.\nParkin is a horrible professor. Not only is he not engaging and boring (although his in-class experiments from time to time make it somewhat bearable), this course teaches extremely hazy and disconnected concepts that most students have no clue what's going on and find it hard to relate to. For example, we are given random graphs and formulae to memorize throughout this course without being told how it's derived or its function. We have to take the statements made by the professor for granted, and practice plugging in numbers into these equations.\nHis course is designed so that the final grade is out of 550 points. 100 for quizzes, 100 each for 3 midterms, 200 for the final and 50 for OWL. The lowest 100 point equivalent is dropped.\nA friend of mine switched into this class a month late and he gave zeros on all the homeworks and quizzes that she missed that first month she wasn't there.\nAnyway, as mentioned, his lectures are dry and soporific, and I never made the point of going to class. He claims he gives \"bonus points\" if you use the iClicker in his class, but after reading past CULPA reviews in that his way of incorporating them are mysterious and there is no curve in the end anyways, I figure his \"bonus point\" scheme was just to make students show up to class. Getting an hour and a half more sleep will prove a much more valuable use of your time.\nThat said, he uploads his lecture slides to Courseworks which in my opinion is the best aspect of his course. They are clear and concise, and have a multitude of diagrams and colorful fonts that are really help understanding the material. Going through these lecture slides the day before a quiz, midterm or final is the key to success to this class.\nHis midterms (as well as the material in general) increase exponentially in difficulty as the semester progresses, and you focus on irrelevant models and arbitrary formulas that have no foundation. Every midterm undoes the previous one (telling you that everything you learned before was a complete lie), and by the third midterm and final, you realize you have no way of catching up to the material and you're royally screwed. That said, memorizing these ridiculous formulas successfully will inevitably lead to a decent grade.\nDon't leave the OWL assignments till the last minute because it will screw you over.\nHis TAs are horrible, and therefore the recitation sections are pointless to go to unless you have a quiz that day. I found it completely okay to skip every other recitation.\nIn general, I recommend Parkin if you HAVE to take general chemistry (ie SEAS/pre-med). If you're taking it just because you like chemistry (like me), then I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you won't get much out of this course. I thought chemistry would be one of my potential majors here at Columbia and I now despise chemistry (thanks, Parkin!). If you're also taking this course because you want to fulfill the science requirement or just for the heck of it, get out of this class now. Seriously.\nNote: most students in this course are SEAS kids (most of which have taken AP Chemistry or the equivalent already) and pre-meds (who...well, are pre-meds) and therefore there is almost little to no curve (according to my knowledge, the mean is a B), so if you're looking to get an easy A, this is definitely not the right course.\nAn additional note to pre-meds: many pre-meds are under the self-conceived notion that pre-meds have to get a good grade for med school. While this is true, I recommend taking Organic Chemistry (if you can) instead of this course since if you wait till sophomore year to take orgo, the curve will destroy your GPA that you managed to build up freshman year. From what I hear, freshman orgo has an extremely generous curve.\nWorkload:\n8 OWL Assignments\n5 Quizzes\n3 Midterms\n1 Final\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Parkin is pretty much universally agreed upon as being the best General Chemistry teacher. He is also pretty much universally agreed upon as being a bad teacher. The order in which material is presented makes little sense. For example, Lewis dot structures and Periodic Trends are discussed without mentioning the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153orbital\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, though knowledge of orbital structure is necessary to understand the topics. Parkin frequently uses vocabulary that he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain. In addition, he wants everyone to have a very deep understanding of chemistry. As a result he moves quite quickly (especially after midterm 3) and instead of having a deep understanding, most students just memorize a bunch of facts. He is not very good at understanding student questions. If you have a question go to your TA. The OWL homework is ridiculously tedious and rarely reflects what you actually need to know for the class. His Practice Exams are very good predictions of how you will do on the actual exams, and his exams are fair. He likes to test random exceptions to rules on his tests so make sure to study exceptions on his slides carefully. I would suggest studying well and performing well on the first 3 midterms so that your final counts for less, since Parkin rushes through the last 2 chapters in the last 2 classes. If you spend some time during your Thanksgiving travel to read the textbook chapter on transition metals, you will be much less stressed when the final comes around. The clicker questions are a very good gauge of how you are doing in the class. If you get one wrong, make sure you understand why. I would like to note that my unfavorable review for Parkin is not a result of my grade. I got an A+, but I attribute that mostly to my high school chemistry preparation. This class covers plenty of material not covered on AP Chemistry so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get cocky. Parkin is the best choice for chemistry but still a bad one. DO YOUR BEST TO GET PATRICK AS A TA. He is amazing, and will hopefully continue to teach after his PhD. Patrick attended every lecture and thus knew what Parkin didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain properly and knew how to teach those concepts in a straight forward manner to us. He also created extra practice problem packets for us which were helpful if you needed the practice. \nWorkload:\n8 owl assignments, 5 quizzes, 3 midterms, and a final. 6 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153equivalents\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to your grade: Quizzes (1 equivalent), midterms (1 equivalent each), final (2 equivalents). Lowest equivalent is dropped (i.e. all quizzes, 1 midterm, or half of final). Homework score is added to compute final grade.  Not a huge workload unless OWL assignments are long. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start OWL the night before. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI personally found that Professor Parkin taught a very fair section of General Chemistry. \nI can't say it was particularly engaging nor was it something that I thought was \nthought provoking. The occasional magic tricks and demonstrations were kind of \ncheesy at times but nonetheless fun. \nThat being said, I still found his lectures notes the best way to study for the tests\nand learn the material. \nHe doesn't do too well with questions. I found the best way to get my questions \nanswered was to email the TA. They tend to have more time to talk you through\nyour questions and exam questions. \nExams: Professor Parkin gives practice exams that are pretty much\non par with the exams. I think if you study and take the practice exam, that will\nbe a good indicator of the grade you will receive. \nCurve & Extra Credit: Clicker Q's and other ample amount of Extra Credit.\nIf you take a survey you get extra credit and such but the way this is incorporated\ninto your grade is mysterious and unknown. I'd say strive for it but don't think it \nwill do much. Also, the curve is not something to depend on. The mean is a B. \nthat means little to no curve. \nGrading: there are a total of 6 \"equivalents\" in your grade. Quiz composite grade, 3 Exam grades, and a final worth two equivalents. Your lowest equivalent is dropped. This may end up being an exam or your final exam may end up counting half the amount it normally would, etc. \nConclusion: If you are looking to fulfill a requirement, go with Professor Parkin.\nI found his class to be relatively low stress and very fair. \nWorkload:\n8 OWL Assignments scattered throughout the semester (some are very time consuming so plan wisely.) \n5 Quizzes: Pretty fair. Some questions were tricky and quite detail oriented but nothing too out of the blue. Lowest quiz grade dropped\n3 Exams: Very do-able. I went to each class, reviewed the notes afterward, did my OWL Assignments on time, reviewed quizzes. \n1 Final: Harder than the Exams but nothing again to worry too much about. \n\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Parkin taught an interesting and fair semester of Gen Chem I.  I never made a point of going to office hours, but he was engaging and entertaining in class (lots of demonstrations and magic tricks).  His TAs were awesome, hosting review sessions before exams and returned emails with questions very promptly.  A breakdown: \nLECTURES: Clear and concise, with step-by-step examples and lots of opportunities to practice (clicker questions).  Yes, it can be frustrating to get a series of clicker questions wrong, but the point is to test yourself.  As long as you are participating, he doesn't really care if you're getting them right or not.  In preparation for quizzes and exams, I found myself returning to missed clicker questions repeatedly in order to make sure I really understood the topic.  \nHOMEWORK: Parkin assigns homework using the OWL (Cengage) system rather than Zumdahl.  There are some errors here and there, but on the whole it is a great way to get lots of \"drill-down\" practice.  For example, if you have problems drawing Lewis structures, there are whole exercises that just focus on that subject; Zumdahl problems tend to incorporate several concepts into one problem, which can be helpful and challenging, but not when you're trying to learn the material.  While OWL doesn't mirror the types of questions found on exams, it is a useful skill builder.  Some assignments were longer than others (oof, Stoichiometry -- so many questions on mol/gram conversions), but you generally have plenty of time to complete (except for the last 2 weeks of the semester when 2 chapters are introduced in a week).  Completion of homework is a gimme, 50 points tacked on to your final grade.  \nQUIZZES: Quizzes are administered in recitation and range from easy-moderate to very tricky.  The key here is to review your lecture slides and any subtle notes that Parkin makes during lecture.  An exception to a rule on electron configurations might be mentioned very briefly in lecture, but will be a 5 point question on a quiz.  Doing well on the quizzes was the clean-up hitter for the semester, as your 4 highest quiz grades average together to make an exam grade.\nEXAMS: Standard Gen Chem I exams, 25 multiple choice questions ranging from easy to difficult.  To do well, make sure you understand the principles behind the rules (eg: periodic trends, shielding, etc.), not just memorizing the rules alone.  Parkin will definitely challenge you, but he's not out to crush you on the exam.  Study hard and you'll do well.\nNote: The course goes along at a pretty moderate pace, until after the 3rd exam, when Coordination Chemistry and an Introduction to Organic Chemistry are covered within the span of a week (right before finals).  It's doable, just stay ahead of the reading and work with OWL to clear up any confusion. \n\nWorkload:\nHomework/Owl: 5+ hours per unit \n5 Quizzes given in recitation, drop lowest: give yourself 2 days to look over the material, doing it all the night before leads to mistakes\n3 Exams: moderate\n1 Final: tricky, make sure you review everything\n"

            "review_content": "\nBefore you begin reading, please keep in mind that according to reviews of other professors it appears that professor Parkin is the best of a bad lot.\nThe good:\n-Professor Parkin knows his stuff. He is very proficient in the material taught, even the\n more theoretical parts. This might sound obvious but as some of you have already\n noticed, or will notice, this is not always the case with professors.\n-You will have plenty of opportunities to improve your grade. Professor Parkin has a \n rather complex system that ultimately benefits the student. The worst exam and quiz\n grades are dropped, and with 6 exam equivalents throughout the semester it is hard \n to screw up.\n-On the technical side of things, Professor Parkin is well organized. He posts slides \n before class, which are well written, and updates them after the class to match \n exactly what was covered during that class. Practice exams are posted quite early\n as well as the answers. Answers for the midterms also go online quite fast.\n-Professor Parkin is very liberal with his office hours and is very willing to meet with \n you at other hours as well.\nThe bad: \nThe bad things, weirdly enough, are derivatives of the good things.\n-Because Professor Parkin know his stuff so well, and deals with much higher \n chemistry on a daily basis, he cannot understand most of the questions that are asked \n in class. You might think this is not the case in his office hours, but I dare you to go and\n ask him a question. Not only will he not understand what you want from him (too simple,\n I guess) but he will also go on and talk for fifteen minutes about something totally \n irrelevant.\n-The number of quizzes and exams is crazy! 5 quizzes, 3 midterms and a final are a lot \n and turn out to be very stressful.\n-While Professor Parkin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slides are very neat; one very important thing that he still has\n not figured out is the semester schedule. We spent plenty of time reviewing material that\n was supposed to be quite familiar to most people, assuming they have the required one\n year of high school background, and we were left with two lectures to cover the last two\n chapters from the book in which nobody actually had former background.\n-While he is often very flexible with his office hours he is also, in fact, absent from many \n of them. Going to his office before an exam and finding that he is not there is quite \n disappointing.\n-The online assignments are a joke; they are very repetitive and every insignificant typo \n will cost you the answer. The effectiveness of a written homework assignment, even if it\n is shorter, is far greater than any of the questions that are presented online. \nAdditional info:\n-Be ready for some cool magic tricks throughout the semester (even though they are\n partly the reason for the bad schedule).\n-The clicker questions, which are easy at the beginning of the semester, \n get really hard so don't get too hyped.\n-A smart thing to do is to take a logic class prior to taking any of Professor Parkin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\n exams as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do his best to turn simple question into logic problems rather than chemistry problems\n\nWorkload:\n5 quizzes, 25 points each lowest one dropped \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 100 points\n3 midterm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 300 point\nFinal - 200 points\nOut of these 600 points the lowest exam equivalent (100 points) is dropped\nHomework (6 assignments, some are veeeery long) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 50 points\nSo the maximum points possible are 550.\nThere are also the clicker points however, that might help you out a bit if you are on the border between two grades.\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nParkin was a waste of time.\nWhy would you ever go to lecture? The hall is pitch-black so he can have his slides. Once, someone asked him to keep the light in the back (on for whatever reason at the time), and he refused, even though it was better that way. At 9:25AM, going to class when lectures were online wasn't going to happen often.\nSo why go to lecture? Clicker points. If you miss high school-style competition, show up for class so you can click on your $40 waste of a device on some tricky questions. You can see stats (generally only half the class or less gets the right answer), and you can score bonus points, whose effect are still a mystery.\nWhen approached and during lecture, Parkin skims the surface. You know that what you're asking is deeper than what he's answering, but you have to take it like it is. Luckily, I had a TA who was willing to put her money where her mouth is, and pick up a colored chalk and work on the board with me on drawing structures, for example.\nNext, the homeworks. These were due on Sundays at midnight, and if you left them for Sunday, prepare to work 8-9 hours on average. And prepare to realize that often, at least 1/3 of it has nothing to do with the material in class. One of the first OWLs (ridiculous waste of money for the skills it builds) assigned had hours of \"nomenclature\" of molecules to learn. But in class, Parkin specifically wrote in the slide we wouldn't be responsible for it. Right, except for the hours we have to learn it on our own. So just like you might find yourself skipping class (ie clicker points), you might find yourself forgoing a couple points here and there on the HW. I'm saying this because these issues lead to one main point: Parkin runs his class like High School, and those of us ready for a college-level challenge are so turned off by this that it negatively affects our academic experience. Of course, there are plenty of \"highlighter girls\" doing pre-med who must love this, and that's why premed is going to be one pain in the ass for sure...\nThe textbook (Zumdahl) was the most expensive one for me to buy, and it really, no exaggeration, belongs in the trash can. It's like smoke and mirrors, like a mirage: when you read, and you spend time on it, you come out with barely anything. It's actually incredible, how someone wrote an entire textbook so badly. Check it out on Amazon; I wasn't the \"Columbia student\" who left that review.\nThere were 3 exams, in increasing difficulty. Yes, be aware that the course gets harder fast, because its focus on bs models keeps growing. Just when you master this basic model of the atom, they tell you, wait! we lied! there's a better one! forget all your freshly-learned concepts because they're wrong! So really, every exam is undoing the last one, because it's on the Valence Bond theory instead of Lewis Structure, etc. Together with the final and homeworks and quizzes, Parkin drops one equivalent. Often what's strange about these multiple-choice tests is that they feel like an SATII subject test - they're all tricky devils. You come out of a test thinking, ok, I probably got 2-3 wrong, after looking them over twice (there is good time for them). Then you find out it was like 5-6. In the final, I thought I'd got 5 wrong, maximum. I really went over them all three times, from scratch; walked out in the last 5 minutes. Nope, I got those 5 wrong, plus another 7. But did I mention that sometimes there were questions on the tests - especially the final - that were completely from left-field? It was obvious they were from past years, when he covered different things. I know that, because I had some practice exams from previous years. So even with the answers to many questions that appear, you have a guarantee that you're gonna get f****d.\nWith dropped first exam, 89% of the HW done, 22/25 on second exam, 23/25 on third exam, and 63/75 on final, that's a B. No B+, no A-. Just B. And I was told to take this guy because he gives more As. This is one of those classes where you had better get everything right, because out of 200 kids only 25-30 are gonna get an A, even if 100 kids more or less deserve one.\nMy advice: skip the \"highlighter\" courses for tough mofos who teach them - those that scare off people looking for high-school style education. There, you will be challenged in a non-frustrating way, possibly learn more (since you're not learning on a highschool level), and probably end up making the same grade or better.\n\nWorkload:\nOWL (online homework) every other week, pain in the butt, takes many hours.\nExams 3 times. Very tricky\nFinal. Beware of questions and answers to them you've never seen.\n"

Why would you do that?!?\n \nWorkload:\nRight from the syllabus:   \n      (1) three exams given in class (3 exam equivalents)\n      (2) recitation quizzes (1 exam equivalent)\n      (3) the final examination (2 exam equivalents)\nEach exam equivalent corresponds to 100 points. In the computation of the final grade, the lowest of the six equivalents will be dropped, allowing for a maximum of 500 points for the course exams.\nBonus points for clicker-questions and using the online discussion board, optional homework and practice exams. (do them!)\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Parkin is great--he's an interesting and to-the-point lecturer and the vast majority of the information you are tested on comes directly from his lecture slides.  The first few classes have magic shows to get them going, but things stay interesting after that.  The homework (not part of your grade) is very helpful and often test questions come directly from it.  He provides practice exams before each test that are also very useful and again sometimes picks the actual exam questions from there.  The class isn't easy--sometimes the information is difficult to get through and you need to spend time outside of class to make sense of things, but in our case the TA's--Wes & Aaron Sattler--were very knowledgeable and helpful and good teachers themselves.  Ultimately the tests aren't easy but they are fair--they stretch your ability to manipulate your knowledge of the information and, if you are taking the MCATs, I think this is a good thing to get practice with.  Overall, I would say take this class.\nWorkload:\nAbout 5 quizzes throughout the semester, 3 exams, and one final--pretty relentless as far as the need the study but it gives you more chances to make things up if you slip on one of the tests.  There are 5 \"equivalents\"--the quizzes count for one, the tests for one each, and the final for two, and you get to drop the lowest one at the end of the class to determine your grade.\n"

But towards the end, he turned kind of nasty, not just as a professor but as also as a person.  The chemistry he teaches is vague and useless. Ruined my chem experience.\nWorkload:\nOptional homework. Recitation quizzes and tests. You can do nothing and screw yourself over for this class or you can simply not take Chem with Parkin.\n"

He teaches in the most roundabout way and makes everything much, much, MUCH more difficult than it ought to be. In the beginning of the year everyone did well because we knew the simple way to do things, but later we started learning RANDOM STUFF that nobody knew how to do and it was ridiculous. Parkin did not explain well at ALL. Still, though, he is better than Brydges and Turro. And he does magic tricks, which is cool.\nWorkload:\nOptional homework, recitation quizzes pretty often, 3 exams, midterm, and final. The later exams and final are pretty difficult; be prepared to do a lot of pointless memorization.\n"

            "review_content": "\nParkin is a very personable professor, he peppers lectures with magic tricks and videos to keep students amused. This sometimes takes up time that could be better used going over the course material.\nAll midterms and finals are multiple-choice, many of the questions are copied exactly from the sample quizzes and ungraded homework he posts to Courseworks - make sure to go over these before exams. Some are trick questions but many are pretty straightforward. Grades also depend on quizzes given by TAs, these are announced in advance and require written work, diagrams, as well as fill-in-the-blank answers. \nHe figures out your grade with a complicated formula, you can drop the worst component and the worst quiz grade is automatically dropped.\nParkin posts his lecture notes online before class, but he sometimes adds tidbits in class that aren't in the notes, so it's worth going to lecture (even if you don't like magic tricks). Some midterm and final questions come from the textbook and aren't emphasized in the lecture notes. Even though there's a lot of stuff in the text that isn't covered in the course, make sure you know the material that is covered, since the overlap between the text and lecture notes isn't complete.\nWorkload:\nStarts off very light, gets harder. Do the homework, even though it's not required, and read along in the textbook. It will pay off later.\n"

Just like Gerard Parkin.\nHe'll start out lecturing on complicated material, and then just briefly mention the fundamental basics that are necessary for understanding later on. Thankfully, you've got the lectures online to save you. \nThe textbook's a mess, as is the chem department's Gen Chem 1 curriculum (which he can't do anything about).\nHomeworks and Practice Exams are really the only way to learn the material, which is fine because they closely resemble the actual exams.\nThe curve is nice, and he apparently does magic tricks or something, but be prepared to not learn anything worthwhile (that, supposedly, comes in Gen Chem 2).\nOh, and don't expect your 5 on AP Chem to give you an edge...you've never most of this material before. \nThe Gen Chem professors are all pretty lackluster, so I guess he's one of the better options. \nThings I Learned This Semester: Something about plastics in The Graduate, the Ultraviolet Catastrophe would devastate the countryside, I do not understand how my eyes work, my electron is over here and way out there....at the same time! and plastics are everywhere! (even in The Graduate). Yes! I'm gonna ace the MCAT's now!\nOverall, it's more the course that sucks than he does. The Chem department needs to seriously revise it, ASAP. I went from being a prospective chem major to choosing not even to take another semester of chemistry.\nWorkload:\n5 Recitation Quizzes (1 Droped) accounting for 1 equivalent, 3 Exams (each one equiv), Final Exam (2 equivalents). Lowest equivalent dropped. Curved to somewhere between a B+ and an A-. Optional Homeworks that you should at the solutions for before an exam.First two exams and quizzes are easier than the last exam and the final, so get your points early on.Everything's multiple choice (except the rec quizzes).\n"
