            "review_content": "\nAni is an exceptional professor and Violent Muse is, by far, the best class I've taken at Columbia. She's incredibly intelligent, considerate, and personable, and knows how to stimulate a fascinating discussion. The syllabus (designed by Ani) was phenomenal, composed chiefly of Russian and Balkan writers who consider the symptoms of modern violence in Eastern and Southeastern Europe. All of the literature was interesting and thought-provoking; Borislav Pekic, Leonid Andreyev, and Ismail Kadare were among my favorites. If some of these names don't sound familiar, it's because the authors we read aren't typically studied in undergraduate classes. Thus, this course was a wonderful opportunity to explore literature that doesn't get nearly as much attention as it should. Ani was always available if students had any questions, and provided plentiful and insightful feedback when it came time to write the term paper. I absolutely loved this class, and hope that the Slavic department provides Ani (who is currently a grad student) with more teaching opportunities. I'll take everything she's teaching!\nWorkload:\nTypically, there were 80-130 pages of reading and a written response for each class. The midterm had passage identifications and an essay, but a term paper replaced an in-class final.\n"
