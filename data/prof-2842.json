            "review_content": "\nIgor was my Physics lab TA Fall 2005- granted it was his first time TA'ing a Columbia class- he is a first year grad student and not much older than undergrads.  The issue with Igor is that he makes an already painful 1 credit class even more painful.  Everyone knows that physics lab is 1 credit, curved to an A-, and TAs and students mail it in.  Sometimes I felt like Igor thought he was teaching a 3 credit class.  No other lab section had parts ADDED to their lab.  Very few lab sections actually had to work through the algebraic deivations of the equations-- I just copied the derivations I had from friends who had taken it in previous years and had TAs who gave it to them.  His made up\"pre-lab\" questions at the beginning were really time consuming- and the depth of the conclusions he expects us to write really goes beyond the scope of an introductory 1 credit lab.\n\nWorkload:\npainful.  ow.\n"
