            "review_content": "\nAurelie is one of those rare professors who actually makes sure that everyone in the class participates and understands the material.  This can get a little scary when she will call on someone randomly for an answer.  The way to avoid the \"Spanish Inquisition\" is to say something intelligent in the beginning of class so that you establish yourself as someone who talks a lot.\nThe material was not particularly interesting, but I suppose that is probably just due to my personal preference for more modern writers.  There are seven 1-2 page compositions that you write during the year.  The first 3 you are allowed to revise.  Grading on these is pretty fair and I would say that the grading is way more geared to content than actual grammar/spelling.  I suppose at this point the Spanish department assumes you've learned as much grammar as you ever will and thus they stop teaching it.\nThere are three exams during the semester which were not particularly hard.  They consisted of ID's and an essay. A good way to study is to just write down definitions for all of the key terms listed on the course website. \nOverall, the material is not that exciting, but Aurelie is a very good professor.  So if you have to take this class for the Spanish major/minor you won't regret taking it with Aurelie. \nWorkload:\nSeven 1-2 page essay, three tests, no final, 1 presentation in front of the class, participation.  definitely manageable reading...you don't have to do all of it, but you should be able to say something intelligent about most of it. \n"
