            "review_content": "\nProfessor Barkey (or Karen as she liked to be called) is absolutely outstanding\u00e2\u20ac\u201din fact, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best professor I had at Columbia. I took her Historical Sociology course a while ago, in 2010. Karen has several unique and remarkable qualities. First, she is brilliant. She is able to explain and analyze ideas and readings in a wonderfully clear way. She talked about her own research in the class, which was highly impressive. And she is able dissect and improve students' writing by providing invaluable feedback. Second, she takes a high personal interest in all of her students, something that is unusual among most Columbia faculty but especially for someone of her status. She sought for all students to be active participants in our course. She even had our class over to her apartment for dinner one night. She is an incredibly supportive and committed professor. Third, her classes appeal to students from a large array of disciplines and are invariably fascinating. This is partly because she assigns excellent readings on interesting topics like religion and fundamentalism, classic works by Foucault, Weber and other great thinkers, and combines theory and history with current events. But it's also because she really works with students so that they select research paper topics most interesting to them. She is really flexible and clearly wants students to learn and enjoy what they're working on. I learned so much in her course, which benefited me in other courses and beyond. And knowing how much she cared truly had a major impact on my college experience. Karen truly is an incredible professor and I cannot recommend her highly enough.\n\nWorkload:\nInteresting and manageable readings for each class, one final research paper. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth putting in the time on the assignments as they are intellectually rewarding and you will get more out of the class.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI am shocked that Professor Barkey does not have a gold nugget. Her classed \"religion and politics\" and \"political sociology\" were huge influences on my decision to concentrate in sociology. Bravo Columbia sociology department for finally hiring an accomplished teacher who is not self-obsessed and arrogant, or dull (as is typical of the Political Science department).\nIf you are someone interested in both theory and current events you should take this class because Karen has a great balance between the two, in both the readings and lectures. \nHer classes are also small lectures, not seminars, but everyone seemed to participate. She new everyones name and by the end of the semester the whole class was engaged in the discussions. Definitely not a lecture class that you think is empty until the final comes around.    \n\nWorkload:\nTotally manageable for a 3000 level class. Interesting readings, which are gone over in detail in class (so don't worry if you can't finish them or don't fully understand them). Midterms/finals are no problem, and the research paper can be WHATEVER YOU WANT. Literally no guidelines, just that we must do something we were really interested in having to do with religion/politics. \n\n"

            "review_content": "\nWhat so I see here? I see a silver nugget. Prof. Barkey does deserve a golden nugget. She is by far the most engaging and compassionate teacher I had last semester. She is an astute intellectual, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care to wear it on her sleeve by detaching from her students and casting them to the TA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. If you would like a professor who prides herself in making one eye contact and who possesses pleasant demeanor and way of speaking, then take a Prof. Barkey class. She is sharp and knows her materials. Though appears to be lecturing off the cuff at times, she has a class outline and presents the material in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fresh-mode\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with such finesse in her cool and collected manner that she makes it extremely comfortable for a student to sit back, listen and take notes. If you use a laptop, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be rude and surf then net or check your FB and Gmail. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distracting to others and she will call you out on it. She is very open to discussion and sometimes allows students to run on tangents, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of the deal with a professor who nurtures limitless borders of inquiry. She admires and respects all of her students and their positions. I will tell you if you are in the minority or way off base, it is not the professor who may recognize your unpopular position, but your fellow classmates who may debate you with intellectual prowess. Her classes do attract the vivacious types of thinkers who do not hesitate to come down on idiotic statements that come from uniformed or ignorant places.  If you want to speak in any academic environment, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine to be in the minority or have your own individual position that may isolate you, but be prepared to defend your position and respect others as well.\nProf. Barkey is a breath of fresh air in the Columbia majority pool of professors that simply do not take the time to meet with students, or individually read papers. She will sit down with you and help you to draft your paper outlines. The TA was fabulous and I was impressed with all of his written feedback on the midterm and during class. Writing a final paper is very manageable if you start at the top of the semester to do your research and reading, and get your outline done as soon as possible. Drafts need to progress throughout the semester as you go through the course materials and read your own selections. If you present Prof. Barkey with your final paper, she will read it, grade it, and give you the appropriate grade you deserve.\nI highly recommend her to students who are seeking to have more than just a superficial relationship with prima donna Profs and TA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s.\nProf. Barkey is a great asset to the department and to Columbia University. I hope they realize what a jewel they have in her presence and dedication to her students. \n\nWorkload:\nThe readings are difficult so do yourself a favor and sit down with a latte and DO THE READINGS before you get to class. You'd be depriving yourself if you simply attend and let her \"spoon-feed\" the bullet points. (which I see soooo often by fellow students who speak or ask questions answered in the readings)\nGet your papers together on time and you will be just fine. Prof. Barkey will help you if you are lost or just can't think of an angle. Study for the midterm as you go along by doing short summaries of each reading and/or author and learn how to incorporate those concepts both historically and into modern times. She really likes to see your thoughts so don't be afraid and just GO FOR IT! Original thoughts and writings really rock in her classes.\n"

She encourages students to come see her during office hours despite the fact that she's commuting to Amherst for weekends and a very active academic. The class was very interesting, albeit a tad disjointed with the beginning covering classical sociological theory about religion and the second half covering fundamentalism in the Abrahamic religions. The class got pretty heated over some issues (re: Israel-Palestine; relativism), and the professor - for better or for worse - came down strongly and stated her opinion rather emphatically on said points. The class dynamic was a bit strange (sometimes lecture took the entire class, other times one student would dominate and/or derail the entire conversation), but more often than not, dialogue was fruitful and challenging.\nTolga, the TA, was also very willing to help and eager to interject in class.\nWorkload:\nNot bad (though readings toward the end got heavy) - midterm, final, final paper (15 pgs), participation\n"

She is passionate about her lessons, and she wants to hear what the students have to say.  Most classes begin as lectures and then evolve into class discussions, with a clear demonstration of whether or not you have done the reading, however she does highlight the important parts of the readings at the beginning of each class.  She expects a lot from her students- definitely a lot of reading, but because the material is interesting, almost everyone does it for the sake of the conversations.  She is willing to talk to you at office her office hours, as well as via email correspondence.  She is genuinely interested in what the students have to say, and this class definitely fosters a positive student-teacher relationship, which is great for sociology majors because she is the head of the undergrad sociology department.  I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in political theory, religion, or an engaging class with a fantastic teacher.\nWorkload:\nThere is a lot of reading, sometimes an excessive amount, however all reading is gone over in class.  One midterm based on readings and class discussions.  A final on the last day of class consisting of two essays, and a final research paper- you decide the topic- 10-15 pages.\n"

She gives you interesting reading, and breaks them down in class so everyone understands what they're reading about. She encourages classroom discussion a lot- in-class performance is 20%. However, you will never feel any pressure speaking out your voice. She does not put any personal comment and review on people's opinion, at any time she shows full respect to your words. Very understanding professor, when she heard some people in our class talking about having many finals and papers due on the same day, she offered us extension without we asking for it. She's very sweet in person, answers all of your question and gives you best help during office hour. As the undergraduate director she helped me in planning my major courses. Our TA, Tolga, is also a wonderful TA. Very helpful, very nice, he works with Prof.Barkey very well, in class he participates in the discussion a lot and his explanation of abstract concepts is always clear. Religion and Politics is a new class, but also the most fascinating class I've ever taken. It is the class that let you really think, I learned alot.\nWorkload:\nMedium .Reading- about 40 pages a week before midterm and one book per week after midterm till final. Readings are interesting. Midterm with 5 IDs and 2 essays, Final on the last day of class of 2 essays, research paper 1.5 space 10-15 pages. You can write about anything as long as you show that you really think about it.\n"

She does not deliver brilliant, pre-planned lectures, and often she will pursue tangents related to current events, politics and world affairs, but these are almost always interesting and insightful. More importantly, behind the Turkish accent she is a very serious scholar who really truly cares about her students. Writing papers and doing research in her classes is a great way to explore your interests as she will be supportive of almost any project or interest, but she will always add in her own perspective as a historical sociologist.  If you are a sociology, political science, or history major Barkey's courses are must-takes.  She is a wonderful professor and teacher, and one of the few professors at Columbia who is always willing to take time for her students and really take the seriously. \nWorkload:\nPolitical Sociology is relatively light; historical sociology is one substantial research paper of 20 or more pages. \n"

There was no way to measure how well you were doing in the class, because nothing, NOTHING, was graded!!  Instead, your grade was determined by one twenty page paper.  That's it, nothing else.  I met with the TA, and with the Prof., and was told that my paper, a topic you choose, was right on track.  In fact, I was told that I was one of the best in the class.  However, this was not reflected in my grade.  I was shocked, and surprised considering I never missed a class, did all assignments on time, participated, and was told that I should consider being a sociology major.  Needless to say, I will not after this experience.  I agree with the other reviewer who stated that Prof. Barkey does not like interpretations that differ from hers.  You must stay inside the box, which I learned early on.  However, other opinions are valid, and can be substantiated, but it is best to keep your mouth shut. Hardly what one expects from an Ivy League education.  I'm sorry I took this class, and would never recommend Barkey to anyone!\n\nWorkload:\nSix ungraded papers, oral presentation, one twenty page paper that constitutes your entire grade. \n"

So many times you get a brilliant, well-respected person in the front of the room who can impart precious little because they don't know/care how to reach their audience.

You get to choose the book from the semester's syllabus, meaning that you can choose when to write your paper according to what fits your schedule or which book interests you the most. For the research paper, you choose your own topic from whatever you are most interested in. Prof. Barkey encouraged me to choose a topic that I had some background knowledge in so that I didn't drown myself in extra reading. Office hours with Prof. Barkey are great. She's very flexible, and always excited to hear questions, comments, and new ideas. Highly recommended. It is so nice to find a professor who loves their job and can share their passion for the subject with their students.\nWorkload:\nOne short book review, one longer research paper. Articles and books to read throughout. But, very possible to follow lectures regardless of how up to date you are on the reading.\n"
