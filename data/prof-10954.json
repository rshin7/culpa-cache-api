He presents his lectures in a format which gives you the most important information with examples of each term/artist/etc.  Sometimes he rambles on and talks about things which have no importance on what he is teaching but it is still a fun experience.  His exams have listening identifications, short response, multiple choice, and 1 or 2 essays.  The essays are very generic allowing you to write about whatever you wish.  \nOn a side note if he every invite you to a concert with a reception, attend.\nWorkload:\nVery light, occasional assignments, 2 exams, 2 concert reports.  \n"
