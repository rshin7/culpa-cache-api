He also encourages student interaction, which is helpful because then he can tell what he's explaining well and what isn't clear to the class (and overall, he does a clear job teaching). The TA was also excellent. \n\nWorkload:\nWeekly homework sets, 4-8 problems, depending on what's been covered.\n"
