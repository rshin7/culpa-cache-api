I easily spent five hours on Chinese homework/practice on the nights before the class.  The work and practice required to do well in this course has been the most physically and mentally exhausting work I have done at Barnard/Columbia, but I loved every minute of it!  Qi Laoshi is strict, serious, helpful, and really cares that her students understand the material and do well if they want to.  Our class was always ahead of other Chinese classes, and her method of teaching is really thorough and will get you speaking Chinese well even after only one semester.  Take this class with Qi Laoshi if you really want to learn Chinese and have a passion for languages.\nWorkload:\nHeavy of course--It's Chinese!  Lots of character writing practice, in addition to vocab, grammar, and voice recordings.\n"

When I first came into her class I was intimidated by her teaching style but then I got used to it. Our class went from 25 students to 15 in the first few classes. \nYou learn so much in her class because she constantly drills you on the vocabulary and the grammar structure. I wish I could have her for all of my Chinese classes but unfortunately she will not be teaching Elementary Chinese II next semester so I have to settle for someone else. \nBut if you want to take Chinese, sign up for the class that has her name next to it. I promise that you won't regret it, well you won't if you are a serious Chinese learner. \nGood luck! I am envious of the people who will have her next semester.\nWorkload:\nAlthough it was a 2.5 Credit class we had daily homework with weekly recordings (she really listens to your tones). Daily quizzes. 4 Tests. 1 Final. TAKE CHINESE WITH QI LAOSHI!!!!\n"

She is not for the faint of heart.\nShe is, however, for those with any kind of real ambition to learn Chinese.  She will work you harder and push you farther than anyone else, and she will do it by putting the fear of God into your heart.  She demands a lot of her students (undivided attention and unfailing allegiance), but she gets results.  Under her, Chinese will constitute the mammoth portion of your workload, but it's worth it.  Anyone unwilling to commit the time she requires is advised to avoid the class, and she will likely tell you as much at the beginning of the semester (\"Anyone taking a lab science?  You should get out now\").  In she pumps questions at you rapid-fire (and not easy questions, either--thinky ones, like \"what do you consider ideal in a marriage partner?\"), and if you stammer, blank or quail under her steely gaze, boom, she moves on.  There is neither dozing nor doodling in Qi laoshi's class.\nIf you can do the work, though, you will learn Chinese at a considerably faster rate than anyone else in the level, and furthermore, you will remember it, because the thing about Qi laoshi is, she knows what she's doing.  She really, really knows what she's doing.  \nWorkload:\nHeavy, to say the least.  Quiz every other class, homework every night, 4-6 essays, everything else you'd expect from a Chinese class. \n"

She is a strict, demanding and tough prof but also one of the nicest and coolest people. You will learn Chinese well. Period.

All other Chinese classes pale in comparison to the experience of learning Chinese with Shaoyan Qi.  She is a very demanding teacher and if you are ready to take upon the challenge, she'll make sure that your experience is a rewarding one.   If you take Shaoyan Qi for a year, your language skills will increase by so much and you'll leave with a much better understanding of Chinese grammar and sentence patterns.  She assigns written homework every single day and you are forced to learn the sentence patterns extremely well.  The dictations are really hard, but it reinforces what you learned in the past lessons, which prepares you well for the Unit Test and Final Exam. \nIn order to keep up with class and her talking speed, you must listen closely to the recordings for at least an hour each day. The intensity of her class is something that serious students of Chinese take advantage of.  I've had other Chinese teachers besides her and have been left very disappointed. If you want total immersion for a solid hour and a half, Shaoyan Qi is the way to go.  But if you'd rather hear a Chinese teacher practice her English speaking skills with you for the same amount of time, consider a teacher like Yuan-Yuan Meng.  My advice? Get your money's worth.\nWorkload:\nA lot of work, but I loved it every second of it.\n"

If I were less serious about taking Chinese, however, I would be out of there in a second.  As most of the reviews mention, she can be intimidating at first.  I remember that the first few weeks of class, most students arrived 5-10 minutes early just not to show up late to her class! \n   Her teaching style was equally intimidating.  She will call you on to speak, and then she will stare at you silently while you fumble for an answer.  She does not easily forgive a dumb mistake.\n   Later, though, she relaxes.  Contrary to what she says at the beginning of the year, she does accept late homeworks.  You cannot make up a missed quiz, but neither do you get a zero for it (it simply doesn't average in). \n    As for the workload, I don't really know how it compares to other teachers, since I have absolutely no interest in learning Chinese with another teacher.  However, I do find myself studying about 2 hours a day for Chinese just to keep up, even when I don't do homework for any other class.  On the other hand, whenever I am in my weekly drill session with students from other classes, I am surprised at how much less fluent their Chinese is, and I am sure I will get another A in the class.  \nWorkload:\nWorkload: Quizzes twice a week.  Homework every day.  Tests are pretty easy.  Mandatory oral drill session.  A very easy oral midterm, and easy oral and written finals.\n"

Qi Laoshi is everything a serious student would want from a teacher: demanding, serious, driven, and most of all caring. Some people don't like her. They tend to be people, who while they may be excellent students, don't have a serious desire to become proficient in Chinese. It's a difficult language and it will take a lot of work, but why would take Chinese if you want easy?\nFor those of you looking to go to China, don't mess around with those other 'really nice' teachers who give easy quizes and coddle you.
