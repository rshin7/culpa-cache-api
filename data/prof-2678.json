            "review_content": "\nGreat class! If you are interested in psychology and have not taken AP Psych then this class is for you! She puts all the powerpoints online before the class. I would highly recommend printing these out before class and taking notes on them as nearly all her exam questions come from her lectures. Reading the textbook reinforces what you learn in lecture and a few questions (maybe 2-3 come directly from the book). So basically go to her lectures! So many people decided not to come to her class and were at a real loss wasting time taking meticulous notes when she goes over nearly everything she wants you to know. Also, if you participate often enough she will give you extra credit. So try and participate once a week or so. I found the lectures quite engaging, but I had an interest in Psychology before the class. I also enjoyed how she asks the class questions and will answer your questions in the middle of a lecture, even with such a large class. The topics covered are broad, as with most intro classes, but this way you can see which parts of psychology interest you most and can decide from there which upper-level classes to take. The experiments are fun too! If you try, you should get a pretty good grade on them. Exams aren't tricky as long as you've studied and shown up to lectures and the TA review before the final. \nWorkload:\n2 exams (midterm and final). Final is non-cumulative. Exams are 2/3 of grade.  2 experiments which are 1/3 of grade. If you participate a lot (about once a class or once a week since the lecture is so large) she will raise your overall grade by 1/2 (ex. an A- to raised to an A)\n"

As such, her lectures overlap significantly with the textbook readings and the power points that she puts on Courseworks, which, as she explains, is the most efficient manner of learning, but make it difficult for the less-than-motivated to continue coming to class. \nShe's one of the best in her field, though, so it's worth going. She is an entertaining lecturer, though, and extremely receptive to student questions.\nWorkload:\nOne multiple-choice midterm and an m-c final, both lasting about an hour, and two group psychology experiment projects. The first group project is difficult because you are assigned a random group, and she grades harshly.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAlexandra Horowitz is not only brilliant as a teacher but also skilled in explaining every complex, enigmatic concept arisen in discussions. Her interest and avidity for the subject is conveyed in her lectures and reading list, never once inspiring a state of boredom in her class. I would highly recommend taking this course. \nIt's refreshing to enter a psyche class in which a textbook isn't heavily relied on, and the fact that the sole material for this class is journal articles not only serves to give students a full understanding of how the field works, but excellent practice for further psychology class reading and writings. As I mentioned before almost every reading was highly absorbing and so engrossing that it went by faster than you would expect. \nDiscussions were always great because this class, due to its specificity, is comprised of students interested in the subject of animal behavioral science, so there never was a time where Professor Horowitz had to continue rambling to fill the time. Class presentations were also fascinating, something that isn't true for a lot of courses. \nHowever, the greatest part about this course is that the field of canine cognition is one that is constantly expanding. Every class there was a new current article to talk about or a video to watch. \nSome final perks: this course only meets once a week which ensures that there really isn't class time wasted. Professor Horowitz also will let class out early usually, sometimes even 45 minutes early, instead of holding us for the sake of running the class for the full time. She also is an extremely fair grader, and if you put a lot of time and thought into your work she will reward you for your effort. \nWorkload:\nThe workload for this class is moderate. About five journal articles a week (skipping one isn't a huge deal for discussion), a weekly email of two questions from the readings to be sent to her on sunday nights, one half hour to an hour class presentation on a journal article assigned for that week and a journal of your choosing with a typed handout about both, one final paper 15-20 pages in form of an experiment proposal. \n"

            "review_content": "\nWhy this woman is not a gold star yet, I don't know, but this was one of my favorite classes of my Columbia career so far. \nPerhaps it was related to finally having an outlet for my self-proclaimed mild obsession with dogs, but even for the less obsessed of us out there, it was undoubtedly a valuable experience. Despite the very real danger inherent in such a small seminar filled mostly with dog-people, this was in no way a pop-psychology, \"Let's tell cute animal stories\" type of class, but rather a fascinating, academic investigation of canine behavior, domestication and cognition against a background of classic experimental psychology. We read not only dog studies, but related human, primate, and wolf studies along some evolutionary biology material during the portion of the class that looked at canine domestication and heritage. \nExcept for one or two papers that I found too philosophical and somewhat irrelevant, her choice of literature was excellent. Her lectures are interesting and paced quite well. I've had some seminar classes in the past that were too heavily lecture and often dry or too heavily discussion and thus unguided and not as useful, but Professor Horowitz strikes the elusive right balance. She also (at least seems to) actually seriously and thoughtfully consider students' comments and opinions without resorting to the somewhat coddling and mindless approval that some professors unfortunately get caught up in when trying too hard to be nice. From what I can tell, she is quite funny and personable, and her passion for the topic is clearly both immense and genuine. She is incredibly knowledgeable in the field- having published a lot on this topic and running a dog behavior laboratory, so if you want to learn this kind of thing, she is definitely the person to take it with.\nWorkload:\nweekly questions based on the readings, final paper, journal club type presentation\n"

While Dr. Horowitz normally teaches intro psych and animal behavior, canine behavior is her true area of expertise and her research interest. She runs a lab that studies canine play behavior and has written a best-seller on the mind of a dog. The participation-heavy seminar involves reading 3 or 4 journal articles a week and then discussing them in class. The topics include, among other things, theories of domestication and canine evolution, comparative cognition between primates and canines, canine sensory capabilities, and human-animal interaction. She's very knowledgeable, funny, and personable. Everyone gets plenty of chances to speak and she's always receptive and interested in everyone's ideas.\nWorkload:\nModerate but enjoyable reading, 2 weekly questions/comments on reading, 1 informal presentation on a paper, 15-20 page final paper on proposed original research.\n"

Absolutely take this class from Horowitz because she loves what she does and her passion is clearly transferred to her students. \nWorkload:\nOne chapter in the textbook per week.

She usually assigns one chapter of reading in the Myers' Exploring Psychology (it's a pretty easy read) textbook per class, and provides lecture slides as well. During class, she lectures with the slides on powerpoint, and supplements them with her own interesting/hilarious commentary. \nIt's REALLY helpful to print out the slides before class, so you can just take notes on them when she's lecturing. Otherwise, you might find yourself scrambling to copy down everything on the slides AND everything she's saying. She's a great lecturer, but also likes to make the class somewhat of a discussion. Surprisingly, for a lecture class of about 50-60 people, she makes it work! \nOverall, Horowitz is a great teacher, clearly devoted to the subject and to teaching her students in the most practical and engaging way possible. TAKE HER CLASS. I'm a psych major and found her intro class to be a perfect segway into higher levels, but if you're only thinking about psych or might want to take some psych classes, hers is a fantastic one to start with. You'll love it. \nWorkload:\none chapter of reading for each class... not that bad\n2 exams (2/3 of your grade)\n2 group projects (1/3 of your grade)\nshe also says that stellar participation can boost your grade... once again, she is amazing.\nThe exams are all multiple choice, occasionally tricky but very fair on the whole. It's from stuff in the textbook AND stuff she talks about in class. Skipping class isn't that big of a deal, but going really helps you do well on the exams. Simply reading through her slides isn't sufficient or nearly as helpful as going to class and taking notes on the slides on what she's saying. \nThe 2 group projects are pretty fun and interesting, plus they're not that hard. She is a fair, relatively kind grader.\n"

The tests are definitely doable, although there are specific examples of certain animals that she tells you to know beforehand. I would suggest going to lecture as it condenses the wordy textbook's explanation of animal mating habits and the like in a mere 1 hour and 15 minutes. Our final project was an animal study, which led me to sit in a penguin house for about 10 hours of my life. Rewarding nonetheless, as she bought donuts to our class presentations.

Midterm and final which were fair and there were review sessions and office hours for both, and two experiments in groups which were fairly graded and explained thoroughly.
