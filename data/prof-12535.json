            "review_content": "\nI think Matthew did a pretty good job. It wasn't the most exciting class ever, but he was clear and helpful. The quizzes were occasionally odd, in that they're the kind where the fill-in-the-blank is a very specific phrase defined in a very specific way, but if you take notes carefully that shouldn't be an issue. I don't know if this is standard for the class, but I really liked that he could just hop on the piano and play just about any piece off the top of his head or show us an example of the style/technique he was talking about.\nHe's quite flexible, open to feedback, and basically this really chill guy who makes Music Hum very doable.\nWorkload:\nLight. I took it over the summer so things were quite condensed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe had two quizzes, three listening journal collections, a five-page report, and a brief final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis was Matthew's first semester teaching, so it is understandable that he was still refining his teaching methods.  He would often assign 2 listening pieces per class (~25 minutes of listening for hw/class), but we usually only covered 1 of those pieces.  The class can be dry sometimes--Matthew can ramble a little--but overall this was a fine Music Hum experience.  The pop quizzes are easy, we only had to write one 5 page paper, and Matthew is an easy and generous grader.\nThe best part of the class with Matthew is that he is an amazing musician, so he can play out different parts of the music for class over and over to help explain a concept.\nOverall, I'd recommend Matthew as a Professor--he makes it as low stress as possible.\nWorkload:\n5 popquizzes (drop one), midterm, final, listening journal for each piece (just reflections/thoughts about each piece) and a 5 page music review.\n"
