His focus seems to be poetry which is a part of those periods but certainly not the whole part. He made offensive remarks in class about the futility of movements to preserve indigenous languages and seemed to have little information about the subject. Lectures were quite dull.\nWorkload:\nPapers (2 take home midterms and a final) consisted of a review of the opinions he presented in class with little original thinking.\n"
