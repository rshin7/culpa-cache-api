            "review_content": "\nProfessor Parsons is a refreshingly straightforward and engaging professor.  His lectures are clearly given, and his expectations are both reasonable and comprehensible.  Exam averages tend to be relatively high -- a testament to his clear expectations and goals -- meaning that this is not a class for those obsessed with curves.  If you work hard, pay attention, attend EVERY lecture (he does not always follow the textbook, often has his own style for solving problems, and does not post lecture notes), and seek out help when you need it, you will do well in the class.\nThis is not a class for those who want to dive deep into Physics (i.e. get a conceptual understanding of concepts).  Parsons tends to present a topic, tell you how to solve a specific type of problem on that topic, and expect you to essentially memorize the procedure and apply it to a general, but predictable, format of problems.  Essentially, I know 'Parsons Physics' but I cannot necessarily apply that knowledge to novel problems.  With that said, Physics serves a pretty utilitarian function for Pre-Meds, and Parsons gets this.\nFinally, I should add that he is a really cool guy, and at the top of his field.  If anything, the class is worth it because of the opportunity you have to be in the presence of one of the greats.  His office hours are, again, utilitarian, but he is a really interesting Physicist and it is a real treat when he shares some of his current work with the class at the end of the semester.\nWorkload:\nMinimal.  Just do the suggested problem sets (a few hours a week) and redo them before the exam.\n"

He devotes a great deal of time to his students, from office hours to email replies.  This was incredibly helpful during reading period, when he held an extra office hour AND a finals review session.  He does an excellent job of completely addressing questions/problems, and is quick to note when certain material is interesting, but too complex to be acceptable for a test question.  Lecture attendance is a must, as his tests are based heavily on his notes and explanations, which are all chalkboard, not electronic.  Only one practice test (before the first midterm), but once you get used to his testing style, you can certainly do well by reviewing his notes and the assigned homework problems.\nWorkload:\nThree midterms, the lowest of which is dropped.  The two that stick comprise 30% each of your final grade.  The final makes up the other 40%.  Weekly (ungraded) homework assignments that are excellent review for the midterms.\n"

He does some fun demonstrations before lecture and is a really lively lecturer.  \nHe only gave us one practice midterm for the first midterm, and you were sort of left to guess for the final two.  However, as the previous reviews have mentioned, definitely study from his notes!  He takes examples from notes and puts them on exams often, as well as problems from the problem sets, so do those too.\nHe is pretty big into the calculus derivations and proofs of physics concepts and they are often included on exams, so if you are fuzzy on the calculus, I would recommend going with another prof who does not put calc on exams.\n I'm definitely not the physics person, but managed to pull off an A- putting in a lot of extra time, but what saved me is figuring out how to study for his exams (from both notes AND problem sets), which means going to lecture is a definite must. \nWorkload:\n3 midterms, 1 final.  problem sets not handed in.  optional recitation.\n"

His tests are hard but fair, and not based on endless computations meant to test your calculator skills. They make you think. Just a side note though, some of the older reviews say that there's no calculators on the test. That's not true in Phsyics 2 - some test questions require calculators, but at least half the questions on every test don't. You can use a graphing calculator, so you may want to throw some formulas on there, since his formula sheet is very sparse.\nParson's lectures are clear, he writes well on the blackboard and he's sometimes even funny. I enjoyed physics lecture, and I'm hardly a mathmo. I wish he'd been around first semester as well.\n\nWorkload:\nweekly problem sets, not handed in. 3 midterms loosely based on the homework, drop one.

            "review_content": "\nParsons honestly loves the textbook. His lectures come directly out of the book; therefore, if you read the chapters and do the sample problems within the chapter (and actually understand those sample problems) you have a good chance of doing well in this class. Still, I think attending his class is helpful. He speaks more clearly than any professor I know, and can occasionally be funny (in an awkward kind of way, I guess).\nThe exams are pretty tough, but they are tough for everyone. There was 4 questions on each midterm, and 8-9 on the final (usually didn't have any numbers involved; only variables). The mean (about a B+) is pretty low, and the curve is pretty high. Generally, he picks questions that come directly out of his notes (sometimes without changing anything!). This is why attending class can save you a lot of time studying. Be warned, though, that attending class is by no means enough to get you at or above the mean. You really need to read the textbook (as painful as it can be because the material is INCREDIBLY condensed). Also, the TA was very helpful when it came to understanding the concepts, especially when the book was unclear. Take advantage of this situation, despite how boring and annoying it is coming in early for class etc. This will put you ahead of most students, guaranteed. \nOverall, Prof. Parsons knows his stuff. But that does not mean he is in the business of ensuring that you know yours. Know the textbook and look over the examples that he talks about in class and you should do fairly well, considering his huge curve.\nWorkload:\nProblem sets per week of about 10 problems. They can be easy, but are usually fairly challenging, even compared to his exams. \n2 midterms and 1 pretty hard final. Whatever was on the midterms generally won't appear on the final. So, study closely the material that WAS NOT tested before the final. Still, everything in this course is pretty much related, so studying one thing kind of helps you all around. This class is definitely possible to get an A, but you have to have a plan. Just follow what I said and you will be fine.\n"

His lectures are straightforward and follow the textbook closely enough that it is easy to miss class if necessary.  Unfortunately his voice has a monotone, droning quality that can put people to sleep. \nThere were two midterms each semester which had problems similar to the homework but using only variables instead of numbers, so no calculators were allowed (this is a good thing because using a calculator wastes a lot of time). The averages on midterms were very low because the class was filled with SEAS freshmen who are weak at physics (I believe this is the lowest level of physics SEAS students can take). This is also good, because if you take this class with a strong physics background it is very easy to do well. My only complaint is that the problem sets were too long.\nWorkload:\nOne problem set from the textbook every week. They were generally about 8 problems in length, some of which could have many different parts. These took a long time, especially second semester. To make things worse, many students seemed to have access to a solutions manual. \nFrankly, homework for a class like this should not take more than one hour, but it almost always did.\n"

He knows what he's doing, but sometimes I felt like I would leave class and still not understand how to do the homework problems. When he explains a concept, though, he will go ahead and do at least two examples of it, so as to show you how it works in multiple contexts.  He tries to be funny, but I rarely found any of his jokes to be amusing.  He does demonstrations in class which are useful only in that they show you that the concept proves true in theory.\nHis exams are difficult in my opinion.  If you do well, though, it really shows that you know the material, because the tests are done all in variables and constants given by letters instead of being numerical problems.\nI thought the problem sets were sometimes difficult, too, but that generally coincided with when I did not go to class--you definitely should go to lecture to do well in this class.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets of 10-15 problems, two midterms, and a final\n"

Parson's lectures largely duplicated the textbook - the conceptual examples he used were often exactly the same as those in the book.  The lectures themselves were unhelpful - some of them were occupied by long algebraic proofs for various formulas which could convince you that the formula was accurate but told you nothing about what it signified or how it could be applied.  By far the most frustrating part of the course was the section on special relativity.  Professor Parsons knows the material well, and when he solves problems he used certain tricks and shortcuts that he has learned from experience.  But he doesn't point out the tricks and teach them in such a way that a student can reapply them.  As a result, one finds themselves copying off the board but not absorbing any useful strategy for future problem solving.  The lectures therefore just decary into a lot of algebra - hardly what a physics course should be!\nA final note: The book is terrible!  It is poorly written, does not provide effective examples, does not have a good solutions manual - in short has nothing one should expect from a physics textbook.  A real contrast to Stewarts Calc. Book! \nWorkload:\nNot bad.  Weekly problem sets to be handed in.  But not graded the week of a midterm!  Tests difficult but good curve.  I got an A-.\n"

He's an amazing lecturer...if you pay attention!Otherwise you will be talking about E=((pc)^2+(mc)^2))^(1/2) and how that relates to people traveling on skateboards that go significant fractions of the speed of light before you even knew you were relativley lost. Plus you might miss his ever so subtle and clever wit! I wouldn't reccomend missing too many lectures either for the sake of the exams and your homework. So if you see this guy's name next to the course you want to take...BY ALL MEANS TAKE HIM!!! He's tough, but its fair, and you will absolutley fall in love with whatever material he presents! He was without a doubt one of the best proffessors I have ever had - he made me enjoy physics despite the workload and my grades!!!\n"

But don't be surprised if you can't do half of the problem sets, most people can't.\n"
