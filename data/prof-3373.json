            "review_content": "\nGian Marie (as many of his students call him) was great. He was excited about the material and had a great time teaching the students and always did his best to make sure that the students understood what he was trying to convey (since he came in from the first day speaking only in italian- no english). He gave weekly quizzes which were sometimes a little challenging, but they were the department's quizzes, not his own work. He was willing to work with the student on ways to improve grades. he dropped the lowest quiz grade. There was one midterm and two finals- one written and one oral. Overall, one can learn a lot of italian language basics from this first semester class. A lot of dedication is needed in order to do well in the class, though. \nWorkload:\nLots of weekly homework, weekly quizzes, one midterm, weekly essays, and two finals-oral and written \n"
