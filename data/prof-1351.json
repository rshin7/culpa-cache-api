A little boring sometimes, but that's mainly because it's TWO HOURS LONG. (why, music department, why?) The readings were fascinating and made me want to be an ethnomusicology prof. What made the class sort of painful was that it was filled with incredibly stupid students who asked incredibly stupid questions at every turn.  But what can you do? Different people teach this course in different years, and Weidman's a fine choice.\nWorkload:\nLight reading, easy midterm, easy final, easy 5-page paper (critical review of one of the books), 3-p. ethnographic concert report. Not bad.\n"
