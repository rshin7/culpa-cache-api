            "review_content": "\nUniversity Writing was the best class I have taken at Columbia, not because of the subject matter, but because of the teacher. In other classes, conformity was expected of my thought. Professors wanted a certain thing from me, and to my intellectual dismay, I gave it to them so I could see that A or A+ on my transcript. In University\nWriting with Jan, however, free thought was encouraged. \"Wake-up moments\" could become a part of my writing. I was allowed to enjoy readings from my own perspective, not the perspective of an all-poweful professor who tyrannically forces his/her ideas upon his/her subjects. This class is one that helped me greatly and stimulated me intellectually.\nJan becomes friends with his students, but still has authority. It was a fun class, take it if you are looking for a laid back style that will really help your writing and thought process. \nWorkload:\nTypical U Writing: lens, conversation, ccp, and retrospective. Some written homework, not too much. No superfluous work, and stimulating reading for most classes.\n"
