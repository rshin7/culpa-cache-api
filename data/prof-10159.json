The exams were easy if you paid attention in class and the papers were always manageable. I loved that she incorporated other artists not in the official curriculum when talking about certain art movements so as to include famous women artists and to point out cultural appropriation. (Every single artist we officially study is male.)  I cannot express how much I love her, everyone should take her class. She has inspired me to take other classes that focus on art during my time at Columbia as well. She makes the material both interesting and easy and facilitates student discussion flawlessly. I give her an A+! \nWorkload:\n2 papers, midterm and exam both with take-home essay and in class slide identification. Class participation is important. \n"
