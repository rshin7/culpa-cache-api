            "review_content": "\nOh dear God. This is an example of why the Core works in theory and not in practice. To have a good CC class, you have to begin with a qualified teacher. Graduate students in architecture should be teaching Art Hum, NOT Contemporary Civilization. This error on the Core Office's part was compounded by Sjoukje's insecurity as an architecture student, which led to her self-conscious grading and her despotic approach to the texts. Everything out of her mouth was like Cliffs Notes, and on bad days, it was like Cliffs Notes gone hellishly wrong. While she means well, she lacks tact, and as students become more frustrated with her inability to provide anything exciting or insightful or thoughtful, she becomes intensely defensive. The whole thing is just a nightmare. For the sake of utility and the good of all, run to the Core Office and pretend you have a conflict.\nWorkload:\nPapers are way too long, but you can get away with not doing the reading. Midterm was crazy. Final was reasonable.\n"

            "review_content": "\nWait, architecture? A grad student in the Architecture department is teaching an intensive core class that focuses on political philosophy? Sjoukje van der Meulen left me exasperated and frustrated about CC, a course that had led me to select Columbia over other prestigious colleges.  Besides her troubling command of the English language in regards to both pronunciation and basic sentence structure, her attitude towards the class proved most alarming.  I found that although she liked me and several other 'pets' in the class, she noticably singled out students who she did NOT like.  She would publicly discredit their ideas and often cut them off mid-sentence.  Interestingly enough, she spoke earnestly about behaving like adults- instructing us never to interrupt her, only to speak over someone else five minutes later.  CC is supposed to be a discussion based class where a variety of salient points can be addressed without there being one correct answer.  Sjoukje (rhymes with mOUse, she explained) would inform us that there was often only one right answer- Hers.  More than 80% of the class left after the first semester.  Just to clarify, the majority of these students did well in terms of their grade but the overall atmosphere was oppressive and tiresome. It was a shame that everyone left, we had a really fabulous class.\nMy advice, get out of this class while you can. I assure you things won't get better.\n\nWorkload:\nmore than the average CC class in terms of the 'page long' postings on courseworks and 10 p. papers.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nSjoukje did the opposite of growing on me as the semester progressed. I often felt as though I was learning more from hearing about my friends\u00c2\u2019 CC sections than I did in my own. Often she would talk for quite a while without saying much of anything at all. She also had a penchant for interrupting students and dismissing the raised hands or opinions of students she didn\u00c2\u2019t like. She missed class a couple of times for personal reasons (a conference, etc) and rescheduled it for a Friday. This would have been fine if it was optional, but the class was told it was absolutely mandatory. The majority of the people in the class switched out after the first semester. She didn\u00c2\u2019t seem to be a very difficult grader, but she\u00c2\u2019s a bit arbitrary. Even so,  I wouldn\u00c2\u2019t recommend her to anyone. \nWorkload:\nthe usual reading, Two 6-10 page papers (no outside research) for which we had to create our own topics, lengthy weekly postings which somehow factored into the grade, and two presentations with a partner debating some aspect of the reading assigned for that class. \n"

            "review_content": "\nAvoid this CC teacher if you can.  Sjoukje (I THINK pronounced SH-ow-key-uh, but not sure since her only hint was to pronounce it like \"out\" - how that helps with the \"sj\" and \"kj\", I have no idea....) is a very difficult option for enjoying your CC experience.  Her most obvious initial fault is her inability to speak English.  English is her 4th language, and it shows - people in the room cringe at the word \"chivic\"(civic) and, given the contents of this course, you'll hear it quite a lot.  Other difficulties arise as the year progresses - she simply does not lead a decent discussion on the topics covered in CC.  She can be very rigid in her reading of a text, and often refuses to acknowledge another's point, even when that point is backed by a strong quote.  Also, she has an annoying tendency to complain about other people interrupting her, but then to interrupt other people on a regular basis.  Often, her point is clearly made, and someone wishes to dispute it, and she will continue reiterating her point and generally frustrating the hell out of the person who has a comment.  Finally, her essays, though there are only 2, are substantially longer(about 8 pages) than other CC classes' essays.  Furthermore, she expects detailed courseworks postings every week, which can get tiresome and annoying.\nWorkload:\nPostings every week, 2 8 page essays, very long midterm and final.  A lot of work, even for CC...\n"

At best, she has a limited understandiung of texts.  At worst, she tries to take over class discussions in broken English by interrupting students, and either repeating what they say, or making an inaccurate statement.  Furthermore, her English from time to time falls apart.  I give her credit for her ability to communicate in 5 languages (English is her fourth after her native dutch, and after french and German), but there is no reason why she should be allowed to teach a class that is very much based upon \"close reading of texts\" and writing analyses, when she lacks the proficiency in the English language to correctly construct e-mails to the class.\n    Class discussions are dry. People have proved Sjoukje wrong on multiple occasions after she made a ridiculous statement, which more than anything, suggested she had never read the Koran or Averr\u00c3\u00b6es.  Nearly everyone in our class is switching sections next semester (I think around 15 out of 22).\n   She's not a particulary hard grader, but her expectations are very vague, and her comments on the papers are ridiculous.  Many of my classmates whom I've talked to have told me that she missed the main point of their paper.\n   In short, stay away from this class.\nWorkload:\nUsual CC workload as far as readings. 2 papers 6-10 pages each. Midterm, Final.  Her midterm and final have short answer questions that normally would be paper topics for most instructors.\n"
