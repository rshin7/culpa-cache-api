            "review_content": "\nThis semester is single-variable calculus and some linear algebra from a rigorous standpoint. If you are interested in applications of math and not proofs, this is not the class for you. He freely admits that he doesn't care about the former. If you want to be a math major, take this class so you can tell early on whether you actually want to have 3.5 more semesters of abstraction.\nThis course is based on Apostol. This is not the best textbook out there (maybe second-best) if you want a deep and rigorous understanding of single-variable calculus, although it works. I'd prefer a different choice, but it's what Columbia has at the moment, and it works fine.\nThaddeus is an awesome lecturer. A number of people dropped the class but came to classes anyway just to hear him speak. He is engaging, funny, thorough, and excellent at explaining things. He's also quite friendly and receptive to questions, as long as they are not stupid ones.\nI know that a large number of people will disagree with me on this one, but the class is not as hard as anyone else says it is, at least if you've ever seen a proof before. The psets, the midterms, and the final are all pretty easy, although somehow the median on the final was a 57/100. Given that this is the course recommended to math majors and supposedly the hardest math course available to freshmen here, I hoped that this would be really hardcore, possibly on the level of Harvard's Math 55. It is not. There was around one difficult problem set (out of 13), and aside from that, there were no challenging-to-impossible problems that you had to turn in. It's by no means an easy course, but I wanted more difficulty.\nWorkload:\nOne problem set per week. These may take several hours each but aren't too difficult.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThaddeus' enthusiasm for mathematics and his patience with students make for a perfect professor. In addition to the scheduled weekly office hours, he encourages students to knock on his door whenever confused and tries his very best to help and enlighten you by offering explanations in a different way. His quirky, hot outfits and obsession with wearing a glove while writing with chalk on the blackboard add to the entertainment. On top of that, he weaves together proofs of theorems so elegantly that will absolutely dazzle you. On the last day of classes for the fall semester, he read poetry on Euclid by Wordsworth towards the end of the period and received a huge round of applause by the entire class, which shows how much everybody loves him. \nBut, a huge warning - this class is especially difficult for people who have not been exposed extensively to the theoretical aspects of calculus and not meant for slackers. You've got to work and think smarter and harder than you have done before because the basic foundations of proofs can take some time to sink in.  The homework are graded somewhat harshly by the TA, who is picky with little details here and there, but this is understandable given the care you need in constructing legitimate proofs. Studying from the corrections to the mistakes can help better your understanding of the material. The exams are difficult and one suspects that the average must be pretty low. But the problem is that Thaddeus does not announce averages due to the unhealthy competition it would bring about and offers no concrete indication of how you are doing in class until after the first midterm (the last date for dropping a class in CC), so Columbia College students are taking a big risk. For SEAS students, many dropped out later in the semester given the longer deadline for dropping a class. So, in conclusion, this course is for people who simply enjoy the spirit of learning and not obsessed with getting the highest grades possible to boost their GPA. This is not like high school when you can always take the hardest classes and skate by with an A, but the new stuff you learn is definitely much cooler and interesting than anything you've been exposed to previously.\nWorkload:\nExtremely challenging weekly problem set of about 10 problems consisting of mostly, if not all, proofs  (40%);  Midterm (22%); Final 38%. Do not take this class with both freshman orgo and accelerated physics or you won't be getting much sleep at all.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThe course is, in a nutshell, must for math or physics major but not very much so to most other students who 'love mathematics' and want to take hard course. Especially, if you primarily want do something like econ and try to concentrate on math or applied math JUST because they are used a lot in econ, I'll say it's useless. Or if you think you are good at math and you have to take math but you do NOT want to major in math, just take calc 4 and feel good about yourselves; you will either think this is not real mathematics because it doesn't feature sharp drawings or intuitions, or give up your love of mathematics. However, this is the real math, which features rigorous proofs of everything we use. If you are going to be math major but doesn't like proofs, just bear with it, since every math class after this would be proof-oriented. \nThe course is basically elementary analysis and algebra. It is rather challenging because it basically sets up your mathematical foundation in two semesters in a rigorous way. It's definitely not easy; another warning for those who doesn't really need those things. Grades are not that generous either, and hard work often doesn't pay off right away, but it does pay off eventually, at least I believe. If you seek only A, it could be risky.\nAbout the professor- He is a nice guy. He has some quirky sides, but they are not harmful to students and rather funny. He is not desperate to convey those intuitions and graphs like high school instructors, which could come off as being 'not good' or 'not passionate', but he does explain physical nature of definitions and theorems when needed. The course is hard, but might have been little harder if it weren't for him.\nWorkload:\nAssignment consisting of about ten problems(almost all proofs) and readings every week. Not really light.\n"

His lectures, while difficult are actually quite clear so as long as you copy down the board and pay somewhat attention as he explains it you should understand the material.  The only problem is his grading setup: no homework or midterm which is really cool but since there is no graded homework it's hard to motivate yourself to do it. But you definitely should do the homework because they are a big help for his 8 30-minute pop quizzes given during class. These are really annoying because they can be unexpected and detailed. He is very proof-oriented rather than focusing on just problem solving which I found annoying.  All that said I struggled with around a 50% quiz average but I studied for the final and after the curve I ended with a B in the class.  Good professor if he just changes his pop quiz system.\nWorkload:\n8 30-minute pop quizzes (moderate-difficult), Final (same as quizzes)\n"

The material in Calculus IV, especially the second half, is a good deal harder than what you've seen in earlier calculus courses, and Thaddeus perhaps makes it seem even harder than it is by asking very, very difficult questions on his exams, usually as difficult as the most difficult homework problems.  I have to wonder whether anyone out of the roughly 100 students taking this course made an A.  If indeed some A's were handed out, I'll bet there were not many.  Thaddeus's exams were by far the hardest I've ever had, and he doesn't seem to apply much of a curve.  I'm not sure what pedagogic purpose this serves other than to demoralize.  You can work very, very hard in this course, diligently do all the homework, study hard for the exams, and still not do well, which seems a bit unfair.  \nOn the brighter side, I found Thaddeus an expert, engaging, even witty lecturer.  I enjoyed his lectures and think they were quite helpful in reinforcing and expanding on the text.  He also seems like a very nice guy.  He just appears to have very high standards as to what constitutes excellence.  I suppose that's his prerogative as a professor.  My prerogative as a student is to try to avoid taking him in the future.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets, two midterms, final.\n"

(Previous teachers: Ross (excellent prof) and Neel (good, slightly boring)). Thaddeus makes the material so much more difficult than it really needs to be. He ends up losing the class 10 mins into the period with his mistakes and overall poor teaching skills. I understand he was a Calc IV HONORS teacher. That is VERY different from regular Calc IV. You might think of me as a bitter student with a bad grade etc but I never finished the course with him, I dropped it. The earlier reviews are all for the proof oriented Calc IV class and Thaddeus may be a decent prof in such a class but is definitely not suited for a non-proof oriented class. In class, he basically proved things without doing real examples (this was even after I went up to him and requested it and he agreed). Proofs are interesting but you cannot take class time up completely for it especially when you are teaching a very abstract, visually oriented math class. \nIn short, take Calc IV with another professor, dont take any basic calc class with Thaddeus. Take his proof class at your own risk =)\nWorkload:\nProblem sets were doable to some extent but a handful of the problems were quite difficult and neither the book nor his notes (if you can say that they were helful at all) were of any use for those problems. Needed to rely on     math help room etc.\nNote: He refused to curve because he thought it promoted \"unhealthy competition\" b/w students and he also refused to compute the avg on the midterms for the same reason. It was hard to see where you stood in the class. \n"

            "review_content": "\ni have taken 5 classes with thaddeus (too bad he went on sabbatical senior year, otherwise i might have taken more). these five semesters of \"thaddeology\" have helped me build a very rigorous and exciting foundation for studying higher math, and also introduced me to one particular way of thinking and talking about math.\nthaddeus is a very nice guy (i'm writing this because there seem to be many people who find him a little intimidating, but don't worry), very willing to answer your questions, and lectures very clearly. he encourages class participation, asking questions to the audience, and creating a question-friendly atmosphere. he lectures with notes, but not from a book, and organizes his presentations very well so that they are not that hard to follow. he is very available during office hours: i remember him answering my silly set-theory questions freshman year with the same patience as the (probably equally stupid) questions about serre duality or sheaf cohomology later on. \nhonors 3+4: his lectures were vey engaging, and this definitely turned several students into math majors. thaddeus is a very eloquent speaker, and this actually helped my english as much as lithum did. although the lectures were fast (or so we thought), they were very funny at times: at the end of first semester, he read poetry to us, and at the end of second semester, he gave away fig newtons and leibniz cookies, to celebrate the inventors of calculus. i would say he is surely the best choice if you would like to learn calculus.\ntopology: on we went after honors, to enjoy more thaddeo-mathematical theatre. the original plan was to take differential topology as well in the spring, but for some god-awfully trivial reason that class was cancelled. the one semester of basic topology was a very nice undergraduate class, taught at a faster pace than honors. professor thaddeus seems to work very hard (just walk by the department at 2 am and look at which offices are still lit), which suggests that he wants his students to do the same. i remember spending a lot of time on the homework assignments, maybe too much. fewer problems might have given me more time to digest the material, but then worrying about finishing homeworks is a sign of undergraduate immaturity. \nalthough the material isn't that exciting (point-set topology), this class was probably the best organized one. i have a friend who is planning on typing up the lecture notes. thus, it is probably a very good idea to take an (advanced) undergraduate course with thaddeus.\ncommutative algebra: the journey continued, and the few undergraduates left tackled their first graduate-level class and (of course) had to struggle a lot. thaddeus' lectures were still very clear, but also very detail-heavy (maybe because of all the undergraduates there), which made some of us lose focus on the conceptual understanding of the material. he covered a lot of topics, and expected very hard work from us. but commutative algebra is a subject that never ends - maybe realizing this is far more important than knowing the few selected topics that this course taught. (i have seen the final for the same class a year later with jacquet, and it's much, much  easier than ours.)\nalgebraic geometry: only very few of the undergraduates from honors continued all the way to this course. algebraic geometry made me work harder than for most of the undergraduate courses combined. following the lectures was not too hard as usual, but the homeworks were a huge workload. during the last month, thaddeus started (finally) to not focus too much on the details, and left out various proofs. \npersonal conclusion about grad courses: i later took other graduate courses, which emphasized the global picture of the material, and didn't focus on the local details (\"the proof can be found in any book on[subject name]\"). they also didn't include any homeworks, and i learned a lot more in those courses (basically from studying all day in butler - on many days, and more importantly, talking with grad students). my guess is that now, i would prefer these grad courses over thaddeus-style ones. but i also feel that taking two grad classes with thaddeus made me mathematically very mature. this maturity was absolutely necessary to get into a rhythm of properly working through, and truly beginning to grasp unknown mathematical theories and thoughts. if you feel you lack this maturity, taking a grad course with thaddeus wouldn't be a bad idea.  \nhe truly is a very amazing teacher, and columbia is lucky to have him.\nfinally, i know that math professors read culpa a lot. thus, i would like to thank him for the very enjoyable five-semester journey!\n\nWorkload:\nditto\n"

Every other Math class I've taken here has been completely subpar, but every day I go to this class I am reminded why I'm interested in the field and am given new insights as to how interconnected it all is.  I wish he could teach every other Math class I take, because I couldn't imagine lacking the precision and comprehensiveness of Thaddeus' lectures.

You probably would be completely scared off by the problem sets, but honestly they're the kind of thing that are ten times easier when you don't freak out.  Just interest yourself (if necessary) in the concepts and the proofs will follow naturally.  This is easier said than done, of course, but my enthusiasm for Thaddeus and his course makes me unhesitant to make such idealistic statements.
