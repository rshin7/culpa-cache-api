Even though he knows little English and has quite the accent, he is entertaining, kind and cares a whole lot about his students and tries to get to know them. He was a pretty lenient grader when it came to labs but was strict but fair when it came down to letter grades. Overall a fun orgo lab experience. The class dinner at the end was very nice and Shenglong was very excited to go, which showed me that he genuinely cared about the people in the class.\nWorkload:\nIn-class (short) lab every week (more or less), Prelab questions every week, Prelab write-up including constants and other annoying stuff like procedure every week, Two homeworks and two formal lab reports.\n"
