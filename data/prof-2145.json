But you learn an incredible amount, so defintely worth it if you're interested in the topic.  Kushnir has an accent, talks softly, but his slides are good.  Gordon was better than Kushnir, but tended to go off on tangents about Antarctica and Malaysia.  He's a hard grader.  Hays was the best professor because he explained the most and took the time to answer questions well.\n\nWorkload:\nLabs every week + lab report writeup, one miderm, one final.  Some  weekly homework assignments.\n"
