            "review_content": "\nI hope Paul teaches Music Hum for years and years to come, because I could not have asked for a better professor. Unlike many art/music professors, he approached the subject in a way equally accessible and engaging to students with a strong background in music (I suppose I was one) and those with little formal training in music. Totally unpretentious, informative, engaging, receptive to and encouraging of student opinions, and understanding. The course was taught in a relaxed manner that covered the major musical eras and composers, and offered lots of interesting history and musical comparisons. Rather than stressing students out with crazy music theory or listening tests, he emphasized appreciation and interpretation of music, and the more technical aspects of music and preparation for listening IDs came easily along with it. TLDR: really great professor, definitely take him for Music Hum.\nWorkload:\nMinimal: midterm and final of the same format (listening identification and analysis) with generous bonus listening material, one longer review of an opera at the Met. \n"
