            "review_content": "\nThis is absolutely one of the most ridiculous classes offered at Columbia. I signed up hoping to learn a bit about what lurks in the darkest corners of the American Colonial mind. However, Professor Kwok merely brings his versions of modern pornography.  (For example, for last week's screening, he brought in his cut of \"Brianna Loves Jenna,\" in which everyone has those triangular hats superimposed on her head and speaks in (a dubbed) high-pitched Indian accents. ) I should've raised an eyebrow when the words \"Colonial\" and \"film\" were in the same course title. Unfortunately, the only rise I got was in my Levi's.\nWorkload:\nTerrible. The professor assigns ten page papers for each film. C'mon! Who can write ten pages on bad pornography?!?!\n"
