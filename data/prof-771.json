He walks around during the class, so make sure you're actually working out or at least sitting on a machine. He's pretty lenient and a lot of fun, and he's very helpful with tips about excercises and ways to tone and strengthen whatever part of your body you're interested in fixing up. Incidentally, he's also got a great body, and he's nice to look at, too. \nWorkload:\nFifty minutes of weight lifting with a warmup in the beginning, but some people arrive after or during the warmup and before class is actually \"over\".\n"
