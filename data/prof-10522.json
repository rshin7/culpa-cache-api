            "review_content": "\nWhat is Anne Freeland doing at Columbia? She is far too lively, friendly, and adept at teaching to fit in with the rest of our professors. Nevertheless, while Anne is here, you really ought to take her class. She drove energetic class discussions with the experience of a professor far beyond her years.\nThemes which were part of the class include self-determination, authenticity, and the role of indigenous peoples. The readings balanced these themes well. The intellectual meta-commentary on them was missing, but I guess the class is \"primary texts.\" \nShe also has a background in Marxist anthropology, integrating this discourse into lectures. While most of it flew over everyone's head, I think it was a valuable foundation for other classes.\nOur group activities were hit or miss, and the availability of texts was a problem around the middle of the semester, but otherwise this was a class you could look forward to.\nWorkload:\nModerately heavy reading twice a week. You can get away with missing the reading a few times, but don't make a habit of it. While some readings were long, few were particularly dense. Assignments graded generously. \nAttendance (10%), ten short blog posts (20%), in-class presentation (20%), final paper (5-7 pages, 30%), final exam (20%, less difficult than regular CC).\n"
