            "review_content": "\nGreat guy with a sharp, slightly dry sense of humor you will grow to appreciate. At the beginning, he came across as didactic and snappy, but it was probably to show that he was serious about his job as a teacher and wanted to weed out students looking for the easy A. Very good at clarifying concepts that students usually have a garbled knowledge of from previous classes. Great at introducing new concepts and connecting what was learnt in a previous lecture with the most current lecture. Those looking for quantitative thoroughness will be disappointed, as the nature of corporate finance itself is not an exact science in many cases. But it is a must for aspiring I-Bankers, and good to know for anybody else going into the financial services industry. I highly recommend taking this class with this professor.\nWorkload:\nAlmost weekly problem sets, 3 take home midterms, and a take home final. Groupwork is required for HW, so be sure to pick out trustworthy classmates at the very beginning.\n"
