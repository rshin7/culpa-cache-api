Since she is a non native speaker she is particularly good at explaining the stuff in ways you understand and helps you think about things from a non native speaker point of view. She also knows a great amount even about etymology of words and whatnot, along with interesting observations about Russian culture through American eyes. I really enjoyed this semester!\nWorkload:\nIt's not anyone's fault. Monstrous.\n"
