He knows his Russian, but his explainations fall short of satisfying anyone with even the slightest interest in linguistics.  To his credit, he does grade the homework, but his comments are not helpful.  He only marks what is wrong, not why it is wrong.  His classes are not worthless but there are so many better professors in the Slavic language department who are passionate about the language.  If you are in his section, you may want to try shopping around a bit more.\nWorkload:\nTime consuming but not helpful homework (this is the book's fault, not his).  His tests are fair but boring.\n"

            "review_content": "\nA good teacher. He's good for grammar, and is pretty clear on it himself. He speaks as a native, but teaches as an American, the best of both worlds. He's not a stickler for pronunciation but just wants you to open your mouth, but that can get difficult since he's pretty shy himself. He makes a supreme effort to improve his class continually, and takes suggestions serioulsy. He gradually incorporated more interactive learning methods-movies, tapes, radio, Tv, literature. It became really fun, and our class bonded. \nWorkload:\nWB exercises that are vital to doing well. He's great about acceping hw late, but you do have to turn it in. It is a lot of one's grade.\n"
