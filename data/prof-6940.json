I took it looking to further my French and now am contemplating a career in translation because of Prof. Raillard's amazing inspiration. We did comparative translation, as well as practical exercises and in-depth discussions about the thornier issues of translation. There was even a bit of creative writing in the class! Very \"outside the box,\" in a great way. Class discussions were usually quite animated and Prof. Raillard was very good at hearing everyone and moderating discussion.\nWorkload:\nCould actually have been more work. We generally had a written assignment a week, and reading for each class. \n"
