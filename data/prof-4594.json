            "review_content": "\nAnjuli's sheer brilliance and enthusiasm for the course material made each two-hour seminar engaging and enjoyable. Her method of teaching/class structure was refreshingly organic- classes never felt forced or too calculated. A typical class would begin with 5-10 minutes of free-writing on a particular passage of the text, followed by a discussion of the passage. Anjuli would build off of our discussion, by posing insightful questions here and there. \nDespite her obvious brilliance and clear intelligence, Anjuli never took on a condescending tone, as many professors at this institution tend to do...instead she was unfailingly encouraging, and was always somehow able to insightfully build off of every thought. \nAnjuli is a fair grader, and it is clear from her comments that she takes ample time and consideration when assessing papers and exams. \nAnjuli is easily the best professor I've had thus far, and I'm quite sure this will remain true through my next three years here at CU.\nWorkload:\nStandard Lithum syllabus + 2-3 supplementary texts per semester...reading assignments were pretty heavy at times...but the supplements were totally worth it.  \n2-3 papers per semester, several creative assignments, some group work\n"
