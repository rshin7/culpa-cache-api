            "review_content": "\nI took this class during my first semester at Columbia, with the understanding that it was a \"basic\" math class, and one that would help me if I should want to pursue a math-related major. Whatever this course was designed to be it was hardly basic, and incredibly difficult. One graduating student told me this was the hardest class he had taken throughout his four years at Columbia. This coming from someone who had taken calculus. To be fair, Jeff, as he goes by, seems to think the class is very reasonable. In fact the midterm averages (there are two) were both well below the failing point. The tests seem to be specifically designed to trip you up, and studying turns out to be futile. Jeff used equations combining difficult terms that we had never worked with in such a format, and the entire class came away from each test very upset. In fact, Jeff himself said he was morally dejected after grading the first test. But apparently that didn't help him prepare for the next, which was basically a collection of trick questions designed for a math whiz, not for students taking a basic math class and expected to complete these trick questions in little over an hour. Keep away.\nWorkload:\nHomework assigned each class is due the following week. (often as many as 30 or 40 problems due at a time). Two midterms and a final. Jeff initially intended to mark the homework but that turned out to be too much work for him so as long as you turned it in you were fine.\n"
