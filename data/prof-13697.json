He tries to connect with his students over *fun* pop culture references, but his awkward laugh elicits nothing more than a cringe. He is unclear, has no idea how to teach, and writes TERRIBLE TESTS THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE. EVERYONE I KNEW IN THIS CLASS HATED HIM WITH A PASSION. I didn't listen to the people who warned me, but you should!!!! \nHe will call the final semi-cumulative. This is a lie. \nWorkload:\n3 midterms + final \n"
