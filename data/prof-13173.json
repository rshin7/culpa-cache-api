            "review_content": "\nNina was terrific. She was so sweet and clearly cared about each and every one of us. I could tell she was kind of nervous for the first few weeks, but as the class became more comfortable with each other, she also became more comfortable with us. Her teaching style took some time getting used to because she would deflect a lot of questions back to the class, as well as try really hard to engage us early in the morning, but I liked it overall. She was very good about making handouts for every class, as well as keeping detailed notes on CourseWorks assignments and in PowerPoint lectures for each class. She also made herself very accessible in terms of office hours and assignment feedback. She was great about turning back assignments promptly and held us accountable for our work.\nWorkload:\nThere is a short reading/writing assignment due every class, which must be uploaded to CourseWorks before 5pm or your grade is docked. I was frequently surprised to discover that not only did we have a draft of a writing assignment due, but we also had a reading/short response due the same day as well. I don't think that the course was always realistic about what students could accomplish in the allotted amount of time, but I don't think that was Nina's fault, I think that is an issue with UW overall.\n"
