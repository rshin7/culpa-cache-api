            "review_content": "\nLike all previous reviewers have said, Carman's an excellent lecturer who makes his points very clear and takes time to clarify and explain difficult concepts. He also has a great sense of humor and endless knowledge of both philosophy and subjects that might not seem to be closely related to philosophy at first glance, like neuroscience and classical music. His classes are a joy to be in, and you manage to get a lot out of them, though I can see that people with a bit of knowledge in philosophy already might find the style of his lectures a bit boring, as he tends to reiterate points quite a bit to make sure we really understand the concepts. Carman also takes time to answer more or less any question students might have, sometimes to good effect and clarifying valid confusions, and sometimes to just entertain the inquirer while trying to steer the subject back to the lecture at hand. This makes his lectures seem a little disorganized at times, though I think he always gets time to say everything he wants to say.\nAs previous reviewers have also said, Carman isn't an easy grader. It's not impossible to get an A or A- in his class (I got an A- on both the papers I turned in), but he really makes you work for it, and if my peek at his gradebook was accurate, he's given out a few Cs and C-s to particularly bad papers, with the majority of grades being Bs. However, Carman more than makes up for his difficult grading with extensive and fair feedback on your writing. I never felt that I deserved better than I got in his class, though some might find Carman to have overly high standards. \nWorkload:\nFairly light- 2 papers, each around 5-7 pages, and a final. Readings were very short and for the most part easily digestible.\n"

            "review_content": "\nCarman is consistent. His lectures tend to be clear, although every now and then he does end up talking about thinkers and topics that seem somewhat irrelevant for the purposes of the class. I am also of the opinion that his lectures on Heidegger are significantly better than his lectures on Foucault. I don't know if this is because Heidegger is just more interesting than Foucault, or because Carman is Columbia's resident expert on Heidegger. Perhaps it is both. When lecturing on Foucault, he often seemed to be figuring it out as he taught it, which was definitely not the case with Heidegger -- although, again, this might be a consequence of Foucault's unnecessarily (and, I would add, sometimes annoyingly) obscure style. Only when reading Heidegger did Carman offer truly mindblowing lectures. In general, however, Carman will settle for being clear and consistent rather than mindblowing. (For the latter, maybe take Honneth or Neuhouser). The upside of this is that he virtually gave no repetitive, reiterative or unclear lectures.\nThe best thing about this class is Carman's feedback. He reads at least half the essays in the class, and gives extensive, insightful and rigorous (but never harsh) comments. Office hours are very helpful, although he does seem more receptive to students' ideas in class than in office hours.\nAll in all, a good class. Definitely take anything he teaches on Heidegger. If you want a class that will really improve your philosophical writing, take it as well. If you want mind-blowing, earth-shattering lectures, think twice. You will get some, but they tend to be rare.\nWorkload:\nthree short essays, reading tends to be light but foucault's a bitch to read.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Carman is a great guy, and that doesn't imply that he is not a fantastic professor (in fact he is), therefore I always wondered in the past couple of months why nobody had ever reviewed him since 2007. As I was attempting to write this review, I suddenly realized the challenges: \nFirstly, Professor Carman (after these 5 long years) still is an engaging lecturer: He is witty, humorous, a-library-of-interesting-examples, and of course very knowledgeable what he teaches. Sadly, his previous reviewers have already said those good things about him. And yes, he goes on tangents sometimes, either to give you one of the aforementioned examples or to (politely) respond to a student's (half of the times relevant and insightful) question. Unfortunately this has also been mentioned by my predecessors. In general, his lectures consist of: him talking plus Q&A; sessions with a mixture of debates and anecdotes. If you have fetishism of highly \"structured\", professor-\"dominated\", \"normalized\" lectures, with little or none \"deviation\" from the textbooks, look elsewhere. If you don't, this is the most fascinating course you can take in the philosophy department(s), and I sincerely hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did.\nThis, however, is the second challenge: It so easily attains the \"great course\" title that I find it difficult to articulate why it deserves it. Well: 1) The course material was (pleasantly) different from anything you would read in an orthodox philosophy course, in other words, \"radical\". Hence if you were, like me, frustrated about the stuff philosophers said before Nietzsche, you would probably find what Heidegger and Foucault said refreshing and liberating, and perhaps at the end of the semester feel frustrated again for a different reason. 2) This course seemed to attract a group of intelligent and well-read students, and risk-takers (like me) who didn't know anything about the topic but stubbornly decided to stay simply because Heidegger+Foucault+Kuhn+Carman were awesome. The classroom environment was therefore slightly competitive yet the atmosphere was perfect for learning. If you were up for the challenge you would learn a ton.\nTo address a few concerns before I end this (ridiculously long) review:\n1) Professor Carman is not a particularly harsh grader and the assignments are pretty straight-forward. What hinders you from getting an easy A is that you have to write much better than Heidegger and Foucault about what they intended to talk about after reading their writings and therefore getting confused about what they intended to talk about (t do well in your first essay. It gets better as you become more familiar with the language and literature. \n3) Professor Carman is, as I said at the beginning, a nice guy. There is no need to feel intimidated to talk to him during office hours. But you do need to be prepared in order to get the most out of it.\nWorkload:\n3 essays (first two about 1500 words; last one 2000-2500 words). SHOW UP (he takes attendances and doesn't tell you how he deals with the data. Foucault would tell you that Carman is thus using \"disciplinary power\". Carman would tell you that \"disciplinary power\" is dangerous but not bad hence you have to deal with it.)\n"

            "review_content": "\nCarman's a good professor.  He knows his stuff and you can tell he loves what he teaches.  His lectures can get a little boring/frustrating when you're not sure where he's going with them, because he does tend to go off on a lot of tangents, usually sparked by a student's question.  This can be good if you want to debate the nuances of philosophy, but, like I said, it's frustrating if you just want to learn what he's supposed to teach you and what you're going to have to write about.  He does enliven his teaching with lot's of subtle humor, though.  He finds lots of philosophical things hilarious and talks about them in a strangely academic tone for jokes.  As far as how tough of a grader he is and all of that, I think he is made out to be  a lot harder  than he really is.  I will confess that I literally did about five percent of the reading and even fell asleep in class a few times (it was at 1030 in the morning and i took the class pass/fail, give me a break) and I still managed to pull Bs on my essays just by reading what I had to read in order to get something written.  My essays were seriously pretty horrible, and he still gave me Bs.  Furthermore, his comments on these bad essays were totally fair and accurate - he pointed out the flaws that I knew were in them.  I think if I had really tried my best and written essays that I had been happy with myself, that he totally would have given me As, because I think he is a fair and not too difficult grader.\nI passed the class, btw.\nWorkload:\ntwo medium-length papers and a two essay question final that wasn't even comprehensive (only on Nietzsche)\n"

His concepts of first drafts and final drafts differ from those of the rest of the world in that he expects two entirely different theses, theories, papers etc. You would think that as the class continues you would be able to guess at your grade based on the amount of work you put in.  Basically it's a grade out of a hat, and if you go and try to talk to him you'll receive cryptic, \"I can't thoroughly reread everyone's papers beause of the sheer number of papers\" answers that you leave you tempted to fling hamlet in his general direction.  And after you worry and agonize over you grade, you find that the final grade is completely different that what you expected.  I don't mean to sound like a jaded student, trying to get out of my frustration by bashing him on culpa. His lectures were really quite interesting, as he constantly questions whether or not we exist, and if you're into the whole \"it's not 'why are we here?' but 'are we here?'\" line of questioning you'll be thoroughly amused.

            "review_content": "\nWhat a fantastic survey introduction to 19th-century philosophy! I was worried, at first, that in spending a mere four months in reading and discussing centuries' worth of thought (think of all the accumulated and processed knowledge and thought that Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche gave the world) the course would resemble something like a skipping stone. But Prof. Carman has been able to a tremendous amount of good work with very little time.\nBut let me be more organized about this: I'll start with a full listing of the syllabus, because I know that I would have liked to have known this before I started. We read: most of what, in Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\", is important to later philosophy with the exception of specialists' concerns; Hegel's notoriously difficult Introduction and Preface to the \"Phenomenology of Spirit\", as well as his lectures on aesthetics; meaty selections from Schopenhauer's \"The World as Will and Representation\"; Kierkegaard's \"Sickness Unto Death\" and \"Fear and Trembling\"; and Nietzsche's \"The Gay Science\" and \"Beyond Good and Evil\" plus healthy servings of other works like \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", \"Genealogy of Morals\" and his essay on \"Truth and Lies in an Extra-Moral Sense\". \nWhat Prof. Carman does with this is pretty impressive. He is always prepared, coming to class with a detailed set of notes and yet familiar enough with the texts (he's a Heidegger expert) to extemporize. He's the sort of person who immerses himself in philosophy and academia from all ages, and he will not infrequently highlight connections between these philosophers and those of ancient Greece (Plato, Aristotle, Sextus Empiricus, etc.) as well as those of the 20th century (Wittgenstein, Allison, Westphal). Thus, he really gives you as thorough a context for appreciating these thinkers as can possibly cram into two sessions a week... \nHis explanations of exceedingly dense and circuitous prose (like that of Hegel) are manna from heaven for someone struggling to understand these pivotal works. While he is extremely open to fielding questions, even from those who it seems don't do the readings or come to class with preconceived notions of what these philosophers or ''philosophy en generale'' are about, the structure he imposes on class time is usually adhered to, enabling us to get a reasonable amount of depth. \nProf. Carman is affable and extends himself a fair amount in meeting students after class and engaging in impromptu post-class discussions with those students eager (and impertinent) enough to accost him before he's out the door. My only problem with this class was the choice of TA, (who KIND of approachable and yet rather abrupt with me on the two occasions I asked him about things) though I'm thinking Prof. Carman didn't have much to do with that decision. \nIf you want a solid teacher with a well-planned course, take History of Philosophy: Kant to Nietzsche. Don't expect it to be easy, just because it's a survey. His papers demand a lot of thinking and work and he grades with a demanding eye. I (without intention, I swear) scanned his gradebook when he was telling me my grade for the first paper (my paper was with the TA, who wasn't in class that day) and I noticed that most of the papers had gotten B's and B-'s. \nThe final exam is just like doing his papers, only with harsher time restraint.\nWorkload:\nTwo five-page papers and a final exam (no midterm). Medium to Heavy reading, though he makes sure that heavier readings are given over the weekend. \n"

I've studied philosophy at a few different institutions, and Professor Carman is easily one of the best I've had.  He made sense of Foucault, which is no small task, and he was perfectly clear about what he expected from the students (excellent papers, not written the night before the due date).  He is accessible, answers his emails, and responds to questions in a sincere manner.  In response to the person who conducted the \"experiment\" with the term papers: I never once went to Professor Carman's office hours to discuss the paper topics, nor did I rehash his ideas, yet I still received A's.  I think it is safe to say that Carman is well-read and  experienced enough to know when someone has not done any research.  Sorry for the snark, but really.

He doesn't appreciate creativity on papers, and is meticulous when it comes to clarity. Often times if you write sentences that are direct quotes from his lectures, or even from the text introductions, he will say they are unclear and mark you down for them. He punishes really heavily for tiny mistakes (saying one thing slightly off-point might warrant you a grade drop) even if your papers are mostly accurate and precise. Also, he doesn't give many chances to improve grades -- he doesn't really take rewrites, except for on rare occasions, and doesn't change grades even when he agrees himself that they are unfair.

(I use the word 'remind' since my friend related to me that when she went over her paper with him, he would review sections that were direct quotations from him and make such remarks as, \"Great idea!\").\n      Point being: this Carman class was great because he's interesting on a general level and good grades are within your reach. However, if you value philosophical precision over general appeasement, and you'd like to practice your own philisophical reason as opposed to restating his, then  avoid this class.\nWorkload:\nLike what other people said.

The workload was very manageable\u00c2\u20142 relatively short essays, which are difficult, but so neccessary to the class because it was one thing to listen to him talking about complex ideas but it was quite another to sit down and have to sort them out for myself in a coherent essay.  There was a lot of reading...but you really don't need to do it, because he talks about everything in class and explains it.       One other thing though\u00c2\u2014there were a lot of people who asked questions in the class, and he always took them seriously and answered them well...which was a blessing when the question was good, but got annoying when the person would be off on this obscure tangent or would be saying something completely stupid, and rather than disregarding them and moving on he would sort through their nonsense and answer...but what can you do?\n   Take a class with Professor Carman.

Carman is one of the few professors who truly cares about accurately surmising the point of confusion -- too many professors misunderstand what's being misunderstood and only further mire the class in confusion.  Elegant thinker, quick on his feet, incredibly illuminating examples (and drawings!!) that show how Heidegger makes intuitive sense.  You can tell that he's truly in touch with his students *and* the process of reading Heidegger for the first time.  Obviously cares about his work -- both in his involvement with the texts and the class.  The first class lecture was positively breathtaking, it was so exciting.  I've never before had such a clear and precise lecturer who also inflames excitement about philosophy.  Just had his book (Heidegger's Analytic) published by Cambridge UP as well.  A real gem, don't miss out.\nWorkload:\nTwo papers.  Contrary to the other reviews (which initially scared me about this course) Carman is a fair grader.  A solid exegesis alone should garner an A-.

Otherwise, he is clear and insightful, the two most valuable characteristics of a good philosophy professor.

Also, to everyone who complained about his grading: he isn't unfair, he just doesn't inflate grades. More importantly, he wonn't just write something like \"B-, poor presentation, developed your least interesting ideas most.\" (Which were his criticisms of my first paper.) He will write two pages of notes on your paper that will allow you to substantially improve on your second and third papers, IF you really consider his criticisms and take them to heart. Also, for majors, the improvements in philosophical prose he will force you to make will wind up helping your GPA more than his demanding standards will hurt it.\nWorkload:\n3 five page papers.

Contrary to what another reviewer has more or less suggested (and I apologize if I'm interpreting incorrectly), Professor Carman is no philosophy fascist: there IS such a thing as right and wrong, over which there is such a thing as interpretive disagreement. If you're going to disagree--back it up. If you're going to disagree with Professor Carman on Heidegger--well, good luck and back it up real well. Professor Carman has an enormous amount of integrity and respect for the philosophers he studies; by the simple fact of his own attitude toward philosophy, he motivates students to respond in kind. His interpretations are highly textually based and draw on an incredible amount of knowledge and thought. He is friendly and receptive to open disagreement, but he will also correct a misunderstanding--which is an incredibly important thing that many reputedly \"nice\" professors fail to do. He deliberates carefully before responding to questions, and will do his best to understand the point of confusion, point of interpretive disagreement, or point of simple stupidity (if necessary). I would personally think two or three times before coming to the conclusion that a poor grade on a paper was due to the professor's personal dictatorial tendencies. In any case, I highly recommend Professor Carman to any and all who want to see what philosophy is all about. As a graduating senior, I can say conclusively that my two courses with Professor Carman have been the highlight of my philosophy studies here.\nWorkload:\nRequired workload--normal. You may be motivated, like many others I know, to do some extra reading on your own.

He's death to your GPA--so before you take this class for credit, decide if you want a good class, or a good GPA. If it's the former, you've hit pay dirt. The guy knows, and moreover, *loves* the material he teaches you--and it shows, from the useful and creative analogies and examples to make the point crystal clear to the way he's able to relate philosophy to his 2 year old. He's so thorough that reading is almost optional--though you definitely get a better grasp of the nuances if you've done it, plus you'll be better able to argue with him (he almost never concedes, but he certainly respects and appreciates a thought-out and backed-up response from his students). However, if you're taking this class for a good grade, well, don't. If you do a thorough and thoughtful job on the paper, he'll rip it to shreds, like he did on my second paper. If you do any less, which I did on my first, he rips it into shreds, then will make you eat it. In fairness, however, he's more lenient on the midterm--and I assume the final--and he gives your overall grade a curve.
