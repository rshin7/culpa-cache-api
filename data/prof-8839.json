If the subjects that the presenter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speak on interest you then you are in luck, if not then not.  It seemed that all of the speakers spoke about subjects around the issue of climate change (and/or sustainability).  Overall, the presenters are interesting and good presenters.\nThe technical level of the talks were, in general, reasonable for anyone who is generally familiar with sustainability / climate change issues.  Some talks were fairly technical and others less so. \n\nWorkload:\nReadings in preparation for each week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speaker, four papers (for those registered for taking this class for three credits) and one five minute presentation which is based upon material from the fourth paper.\n"
