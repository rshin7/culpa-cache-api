            "review_content": "\nGetting along Lalith requires more efforts than with other Econ professors. His exams are fairly written and his homework is nothing crazy, but the lectures are sometimes rather insulting in the sense that he expected certain answers from his students and if you recalled something quite different from his expectations, he would interrupt you instantly and directed the question to another student and so forth. The course content is straightforward and if you do well in the final, your grades may get bumped up (I did a little above average during the midterm, and got a few checks instead of check-pluses for problem sets, but my final grade is satisfactory). The latter half of the course has more topics with applications, such as job market signaling, time preference theory, and some preliminary game theory model, which are more interesting than the first half with consumer and demand theory. Having said though, understanding the first half is indeed, as the Professor claimed, crucial for understanding further topics. The course in overall is well designed and my TA Effie is extremely helpful. She compensated for the fact that Lalith is not very interested in things like office hours per se. Yeah -- he's intelligent, but pretentious in some ways. Be prepared for that and you will be fine. \nWorkload:\nWeekly/biweekly p-sets (11 in total)\n1 midterm, 1 final, mandatory recitation that goes over the solutions to p-sets \n"

            "review_content": "\nI understand why some people have complaints Lalith's teaching style because sure, he can be condescending, but if you learn to laugh it off you'll recognize how much he's actually taught you. \nThe only real frustrating thing was the lack of communication between professor, TA, and grader. At times they would contradict each other, or simply seem to not know what was going on in the lecture/recitation & problem sets. Also, and much more subjectively, his manner of flippantly writing people off when they don't get his definitions correct to the letter seemed to disincentive many students from participating; this was especially ironic when he himself would give different definitions from the ones I carefully memorized in order to avoid public humiliation (I say this lightly, at least he's funny...). Obviously, this still made the point of how essential the definitions were; perhaps it could just be done in a less dramatic manner. \nHe knows the material inside and out, and he explains everything with a clarity that I haven't found elsewhere in Columbia or Barnard Economics courses. He makes his courses challenging, and because he does not curve the class (he uses a weighting system), you know that your input into the course directly impacts the grade you receive. He makes sure to go over anything that people don't understand, and his (often biting) wit kept us engaged even when the topics were dreadful. The PSets were annoying at first but the grader was chill and the TA goes over every problem the next week in recitation. I was completely surprised to have enjoyed Microeconomics; his real-world examples and tangents about his research made it clear why this stuff is actually worth studying.\nWorkload:\nWeekly Psets, later in semester they become very straightforward\nRough-ish midterm (he's bad at gauging time necessity) \nIn-Class Final (should be interesting...haven't taken it yet)\n"

This may be due to the fact that the grader (who was different from the TA and the lecturer) was a new parent, but cmon, I need problem sets back that cover the midterm material BEFORE the midterm, not over a month after.  Its a doable class, but i dreaded going to every single lecture. His midterms are also annoying AF, where he asks for definitions and math problems, so don't take if you're looking for a more math focused course.  \nWorkload:\ntons of problem sets, 1 almost every single week\nmidterm\nfinal\nweights are assigned based on how well you did in each category\n"

            "review_content": "\nI took Micro with Professor Munasinghe. For those of you who've read the previous negative reviews and are concerned, they're UNTRUE. Munasinghe is a good professor, and Micro is a class you'll enjoy and learn. \nThis is a good class because:\n1. Organization: the course is structured around his topic-based lecture notes, which contain everything you need to know for homework and exams. Personally, I don't like classes where readings are irrelevant. Those courses usually have synthesized lecture notes but still require you to read to capture meaningless details that might trap you in the exams. Hate that. In Munasinghe's micro, if he tells you to read something, you definitely want to read it.  Everything you work on and read is core to the class and exams. The class has a minimalist style by design. \n2. Materials: Recently when I told a Barnard alum that I was taking Munasinghe's micro, she said a lot of the staffs she learned in it come back to her in the job (she's a consultant). I feel the same way about this class's usefulness. Micro is about the tangible economics: consumer choice, producer's choice, pricing, job market etc. I personally find that more interesting than Macro. Munasinghe teaches you a solid foundation of all theoretical topics and applications. And because they're so relevant to your life, you might be thinking in micro language next time when you face a \"price bundling\" or decreasing marginals (that's why I always get grande in starbucks).\nMunasinghe is a good teacher because:\n1. His philosophy of teaching economics:. Economics is all about models and assumptions. Most of the time, your econ professors give you some definitions and quickly jump to maths on the next lecture slide, and then you go home happy about knowing one more equation you can plug in. Munasinghe makes sure you know what you're talking about when you use a concept (and it makes a considerable part in your exam). He goes over the math part, but he attaches economic interpretation to the derivatives and results. I like that he is teaching us the economic way of thinking. \n2. He is incredibly good at lecturing: he does not use slides. Everything he says is in his lecture notes (by that I mean everything). You won't be missing any materials if you don't come to the lecture, but so far this class has the highest attendance of all classes I\"ve  had. Why? First, he comes up with many ways to interpret what he says on the lecture notes. By the time you leave you will definitely be able to define the materials in your words. Second, he is so funny. He gives you the feeling of \"yeah I hate this staff too but here we go.\" He often digresses into real world applications for half an hour and the class just doesn't want him to stop (One time he talks about the best ice cream in this area)\u00ef\u00bc\u017dYes he points to students for questions and quickly wave you aside when you're wrong, but it's not personal. He wants everyone to know the concepts. In addition it's your fault that you're wrong. It's not a creative writing class guys. \n3. He's an intelligent scholar: The first day of class he will tell you his interesting educational path, which includes philosophy and politics. Indeed he's concerned about how human's drive for profits have changed or shaped our behaviors. This is very different from macro economists who take joy in analyzing aggregate curves moving around by a magical tap from the Fed. You'll think about what he said, and you'll realize how smart this guy is. \nThis is a Barnard class and Columbia does not allow their econ majors to take this version of Micro, but for those of you who are interested in Munasinghe, he also teaches Labor and his seminar, which I plan on taking. \n\nWorkload:\nLight-medium. bi-weekly (later weekly) problem sets that are not difficult.  Midterm and final are well written and fair. Contains term definitions and problems that are similar to homework.  No readings required. Textbook chapters are not necessary either. The time you spend on this class will lead to the highest efficiency and no complaints. \n"

I read reviews about him before I decided to take this class, and thought that he would be manageable to deal with because he just got back from his tenure, but I was wrong. He still sucks. All of these reviews are true. \nHe interrupts you whenever you are trying to make a point. He tells you to \"just stop\" and says \"nope, next\" on to the next student who is trying to answer his incredibly vague questions. He asks the class to do small group presentations on a philosophical reading, and then when you don't present the material the exact way he wants it, he interrupts your presentation and basically makes you feel bad for even talking in the first place. On top of that, he is incredibly inaccessible and makes sure that you know he is a busy person and that his life is busier and more important than yours.\nAt first, he will seem extremely cool and offer to give the class free wine tastings and etc, but he will not follow through. He is incredibly self-centered, doesn't think you're important, and is only teaching this class to make himself feel like he is benefitting humans in the long run; that his class is a gift to us. He sucks.\nWorkload:\nReadings every week. 1-2 group presentations & a write up of each presentation. 1 final paper 10-15 pgs. Class participation.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI took Professor Munasinghe's class for Intermediate Micro and I loved it, as did several people I know. Yes, perhaps Micro isn't the world's most exciting subject, but Munasinghe makes it very, very doable and sometimes interesting.\nHe doesn't expect his students to have a great knowledge of mathematics and he works from the ground up. He gradually builds concept on concept and when he does the other side of Micro in the 2nd half of the class, it feels like repetition. I took this class last year (spring) and I feel it has served me well.\nMunasinghe never lies to your that he's in love with the basic-basic aspects of Micro, but you can really see his passion when he discusses job signaling models and uncertainty problems. He makes everything very easy, very manageable, and I ended up learning everything I need for UL courses. \nThe best part is his lecture notes. They're much better than any textbook (don't buy a book) and if you read them, memorize definitions, and re-do the problem sets, then you're absolutely ready for the exams. He gives you pretty much the same questions as problem sets on the exams.\n\nSide note: the second problem set was the hardest one for the whole course and scared people away. Don't worry, it gets much easier from that point, and if you do your work... you'll find it 'easy' by the time you get through with his course.  \nSide note 2: Yes, he calls on people and asks for definitions. He asks because they're INCREDIBLY important for the concepts. When you know an exact definition, you can solve special cases. When you don't, you can't. It's that simple. \nWorkload:\nLight-medium. Yes, there were problem sets but they really weren't too bad. Some were lengthy, some weren't. The TA was awesome in recitation. Midterm and Final. He basically put your grades together and chose the best combination to give a grade.\n"

Prof. Munasinghe can explain all of the concepts, but you really have to do the math and know detailes from the notes.\nWorkload:\nproblem sets which take a while to do, midterm, final...the usually painful exams..\n"

He definetly taught our class how to break down difficult reading.  The readings were equally fascinating.  I would love to take another class with him.  He's so cool that I just wanna hang out with him and talk about life and how depressing it is.\nWorkload:\n3 papers, drafts for all but final paper graded...oral presentation that only helps, doesnt hurt...2 class leading discussions...not as hard as long as you speak to him about your paper...he's always willing to help despite his busy schedule\n"

True, he is a stickler for preparation and doesn't mask his opinions about comments made, but he presents the material from Marx to Nietzsche to Freud to Orwell in an interesting and refreshing way. Lalith is a tough grader, so expect to work very hard. I know some people have reservations about Lalith, but if you're willing to do the reading on time and carefully, contribute to class discussions and take his constructive criticisms seriously, you will learn a lot about the subject and about yourself as a student. \nWorkload:\nThree or four concise three-page papers and an oral presentation. Lead class discussion at least twice.\n"

But, in my opinion, he's also really cool. I think his attitude makes lectures interesting and fun. He's excellent at conveying subject matter, and I thought the course material was interesting. Yeah, he won't hide his antipathy towards whiners and grade grubbers... but s**t, those people piss me off too. If you get a kick out of seeing smart-asses being taken down a notch, then you'll like Munasinghe. In addition to having had him for this course, Munasinghe is also my major adviser, and I think he's f**king awesome: down-to-earth, accessible, will help you out in a jam, etc. He's kind of a smart-ass himself, but in a funny way; I don't know about this \"indifferent and rude\" stuff that the other person is talking about.... that hasn't been my experience at all. \nWorkload:\nnot too bad: one midterm, a final, and problem sets about once every two weeks that aren't graded. \n"
