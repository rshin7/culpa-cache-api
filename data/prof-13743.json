            "review_content": "\nHung was a great chemistry TA and an all-around great person. He was shy at first and stuttered when teaching, but he became confident as the weeks went by. He puts a lot of time and effort into making sure our recitations are inclusive and that any student that is struggling catches up to the rest of the class. The best thing about Hung is that he wants us all to succeed and is willing to meet with you and answers your emails until all of your questions are answered (for instance, he emailed us a bunch of explanations about hard concepts before our second mid-term). If you're okay with your TA having a bit of an accent, Hung is your guy.\nWorkload:\nStandard GenChem REC workload ---- quiz every week aside from weeks with a midterm. His quizzes are pretty lenient.\n"
