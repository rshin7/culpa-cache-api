            "review_content": "\nI would highly recommend Nina's class to any incoming Russian student.  I sat in on a few other Elementary Russian courses and Nina's was by far the most rewarding.  Her class is very challenging but will prepare any student well for the Russian language.  The class is spoken from the first day all in Russian, and every day the subject matter reflects the homework from the previous night.  If you keep up in class, you are sure to do well on tests and in the language in general.  Nina is a very patient, friendly and funny teacher, also, but will get annoyed with you if you do not show that you are prepared to speak in class or if you do not try.  She really makes learning the language interesting, and fun at times.  She clearly loves the language.\nWorkload:\nAverage 2 hours of homework every night from Russian Workbook.  Sometimes work can range anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours though.  Tests and a written composition for every chapter containing all previously learned subject matter.  Homework is collected every day.\n"
