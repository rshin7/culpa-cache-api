Giuliana's discussions sections were by far the best I had in any class--and I had a lot of them.  The class itself was fantastic, and the discussion sections made it even better.  She answered questions well and always had some interesting way to discuss the material.\n"

In discussion, she would waste time going off on tangents that were not pertinent to lecture, speak to her students in patronizing tones, and give us group work in which little was accomplished. \nWished I had switched out at the beginning of the semester.\nWorkload:\nVery little other than what was assigned by the professor\n"
