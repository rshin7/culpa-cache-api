She treats you like a friend, she\u2019s a very graceful, thoughtful friend.\nTo be honest, I just liked being in her class because it was nice to be around somebody who I wanted to imitate.\nAs is often the case UW, The grading was tough. I had a particularly rough time with timeliness, and I felt that she was fair to the other students. (I was penalized) but, she\u2019d always (reach out, check in, make herself available, etc) -this is the rare kind of UW professor that really cares, and provides extremely insightful feedback. She really does the work to understand what you were trying to say in your writing.\nI can\u2019t recommend her enough. She makes you want to take UW again. that\u2019s no small thing\n(This is for Emily\u2764\ufe0fThis is for Emily Hunt Kivel), site won\u2019t allow me to review her because she\u2019s new.\nWorkload:\nWell, this is my first semester, so I don\u2019t have a lot to compare it to, but, it was too easy (until a deadline rolled up)-\nThat says more about my study habits than it does about her class. Pretty sure it\u2019s the normal amount.\n"
