In a Poli Thought class already made into a circus by the fact that Prof Colby could never get there on time, he just made it things even more awkward. Although we were supposed to sign up for section, only about half (25 out of 50 or so) ever actually came. He is a very soft-spoken immigrant and it is sometimes hard to hear what he is saying. Thought he is intelligent, it is hard to get much out of section. The truth, though, is that without any papers you don't really need his help to do well. He is a really sweet guy, though.\n"
