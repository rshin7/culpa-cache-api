            "review_content": "\nFrisch is nice, approachable, and he honestly expects his students to be interested in learning about music history. Do not take his class unless you REALLY care about the content music hum. He uses \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Music in the Western World: A History in Documents\u00e2\u20ac\u009d instead of the normal textbook. This book is essentially the bastard child of the CC and Music Hum texts; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incredibly boring and expensive. Frisch rarely goes over the assigned readings in class, but he expects students to identify and analyze the passages. Instead he spends the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcextra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time (30+ minutes) showing scenes from operas. This wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem, except for the fact that it was almost the end of the semester and we hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t covered American music yet.\nAlso, he sings; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terrible and hilariously awkward. He has forced the class to sing on two different occasions, despite the fact that everyone was clearly uncomfortable and half of us did not know the words to the song.\n\nWorkload:\nMust complete 2/3 (normally all 3 but our workload was altered due to the hurricane. \n1 listening assignment ~1250 words\n1 opera report ~1250 words\n1 concert report ~1250 words\nShort readings from the textbook that no one even pretended to do.\nWeekly blog posts that he thankfully abandoned have way through the semester.\nMidterm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c known listening, unknown listening, ids\nFinal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c known listening, unknown listening, ids, take home essay ~500 words\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nI was pleasantly surprised to see the music department offer a class validating musical theater as a serious discipline worthy of study.  Based on our class size, it should be offered every semester.   Sadly, the class was intent on focusing on some rather obscure composers and works at the expense of iconic creators.  There was no mention of Jule Styne, Marvin Hamlisch, Cy Coleman, or Comden and Green, for example.   Masterpieces like \"Annie Get Your Gun,\" \"Gypsy,\" and \"A Chorus Line\" were negated for shows like \"Lady in the Dark,\" and \"The Cradle Will Rock.\" Moreover, our class was blessed with outstanding pianists, composers, and performers, some of which were actual working professionals.  Accordingly, we would have been better served having such students provide musical examples rather than suffering through Frische's piano playing.  Although Frische is amusing and charming, he lacks the \"it\" factor.  In short, he does not possess the star quality of the performers or creators that he references in class.  It is that quality that defines the American Musical Theater.  I still enjoyed this class especially the guest speakers, but the American Musical is rather like a mediocre Broadway show.  Novices or out of towners may enjoy it, but hard core students may want to attend something more theatrical.  \nWorkload:\nWeekly readings and video clips, some of which are very interesting.  Mid term was a scene study paper of about five pages.  In addition, a show report similar to Music Humanities concert report, and a final exam involving lots of memorization. Grading was arbitrary and somewhat perplexing.  Some outstanding students did poorly, and some poor students did outstandingly.  \n\n"

            "review_content": "\nI'm not sure why Frisch teaches this class. He is not a scholar in the area by any means; he seems to just have a mild interest in musical theatre, and perhaps a deeper interest in one or two composers. I'm also not sure why Music Hum is even a prereq for the class; the material one learns in MH was referenced once or twice, and the depth of the class was about the same.\nContent-wise, it's probably not worth your time. I would guess that the class as a whole already knew most of the material he covered. The main draw is the guest speakers, all of whom were far more interesting than WF could ever hope to be. Sadly, neither Kander nor Sondheim could make it this semester, but the men Frisch did get to come were quite entertaining and informative.\nLastly, you would be hard pressed to find a more boring individual than Walter Frisch. He does seem to have a sense of humor, but it very rarely comes to class with him. And his speaking voice is rather reminiscent of Marlon Brando, but not in a good way by any means.\nWorkload:\nMinimal. Midterm was a takehome essay of ~1500 words requiring analysis of a scene from a musical. Final was 10 video IDs and 10 of 14 IDs of terms and quotations. There was also a Music Hum-style concert report of a professional show, also ~1500 words. Grading of the two written assignments is a bit odd IMO; those of you less prone to procrastination would probably do well to get his comments on a first draft (he will do so for both the midterm and the report as I recall).\nHe also had a percentage for attendance which he took EVERY SINGLE CLASS, albeit by passing a sheet around. Stranger, he passed one of these sheets around at the final. lolwut\n"

His class is generally enlightening, but not enough to keep everyone awake in the dreadful 9:10am slot (someone is always asleep in the class, but he doesn't really care). If you stay awake for the most part and take notes, you won't need to do any assigned readings. He is a very busy person and although he cares greatly about the subject topic, he does not have that much time to deal with the details of the class. As a result, the writing assignments are graded lightly - as long as you focus on the topics that he covered in class. \nIf you can manage to drag yourself to his class every other day, then take him! There are no \"required readings\", no quizzes, no responses that other Music Hum sections are required to do. In fact, if you got him, you have lucked out (besides the 9:10 part). \nMidterm and Final were both the same structure, both very fair. Just know your listening, terms and you should be fine. \nWorkload:\n2 concert report ~ 750 words each, very easy\n1 listening assignment ~ 1200 words, \nMidterm & Final (take home essay)\n\n"

In itself, the class wasn't too difficult, but I at least found that I learned a lot about many periods of music.  Since he is a musicologist, he focused on the history and culture of various musics and how that influenced the finished product.  The only thing, frankly, that seemed to hold back the class was that the vast majority of students never did the reading or listening in a serious way and struggled throughout the semester with the technical vocabulary required to have interesting discussions about music.  When people can't talk about the significance of bitonality in Stravinsky or serialism in the Second Vienna School, its hard to get into the nitty-gritty of musical analysis.\nI didn't find that he was particularly nit-picky about grammar and thought on the contrary that he was rather generous (at the very least, fair) in his grading of papers.  I suppose that grammatically incoherent papers should be downgraded if only because it makes understanding them more difficult.\nWorkload:\n2 concert reports, 2 listening assignments, all relatively easy, short assignments that required some critical thinking about music.\nMidterm with listening, fill-in-the-blanks and an essay\nFinal was the same except that the essay was take-home\n"

Of course, this means that the class focuses quite heavily on historical and theoretical interpretations of music, leaving more \"what do you feel\" questions aside.  \nFrisch clearly values quality writing and grades well-written papers much higher than those which contain similar arguments less eloquently stated.  The reading is more or less optional as the tests only cover material discussed in class, but this makes attendance and attentiveness important.  As the class is at 9am, these can be a struggle some days.  \nThe listening portions of the exams also come from material played and discussed in class, which is nice - Frisch isn't out to trick you and seems to genuinely want you to do well.  All in all, a decent class, making Music Hum tolerable if not fun.\nWorkload:\n2 Concert Reports (3 pages)\n2 Short Papers (2-3 pages)\nMidterm & Final (~1hr each)\nWeekly reading and listening (the latter being helpful for the midterm and final)\n"

            "review_content": "\nBesides music humanities in itself being a sketchy field of study (how can you actually define what music really is, and analyze it? Who says Arnold Schoenberg was great? Maybe no one, and that's why they weren't famous like rising commercial artists and the whole jazz/rock scene ((Which is scantly mentioned)). A couple of decaying farts in a music conservatory? They're so disconnected from reality....) Seriously, if it weren't for large colleges allocating so much of their budget into these classical music departments, this man would be out of work! There is no marketable skills here!\nThe course itself is a little sketchy to someone majoring in economics, mathematics or any hard science that requires brain activity. The course can be described to being an enjoyment experience (listening to music) fused with reading and the creation of a vocabulary to describe music. The textbook even attempts the usage of graphs to illustrate a few points.\nFrisch harshly criticizes one's writings, and spends more time critiquing one's grammar and choice of words than actual substance. Unless one is entirely consumed in the class and writes lovely sentences about the concerts and the songs, he really acts like a vicious viper raping your every line. They are the true daggers to your grade, and there are 4 of them.\nThe exams are literally a joke, and as long as you can listen to the music and pay attention in class, you'll be fine, and walk away with at least a B+ on the exams. However, its the papers once again that will do you in.\nMore on the professor - he's is sloppy with the notes he writes on the board, and is very engaging with the class. he occasionally sings and plays the piano, and is somewhat klutzy with technology, but not as much as his even blunter T.A.'s. Throughout the class, he frequently looks at his notes and reads often from a variety of texts in front of him, giving the impression that he isn't the brightest light bulb.\nThe man does little justice to what I feel actually is great music, and he used to be the chair of music humanities apparently. Don't take him if you have the option, unless you're a senior in my case, and had no choice in choosing quickly filled sections.\nWorkload:\nAssuming he leaves his exams unchanged,\nMidterm & Final - Involves identifying 5 tracks that you've listened through up until that point in the semester, identifying 5 unknown tracks similar to the ones you've hear and then identifying like 5 key words. That's basically it\npapers - 1) 2 concert reports, each 3 pages. -  where you must attend a show. CU ARTS offers cheap opera tickets.\n2) A comparison paper between two pieces, about 4 pages. - Usually Schumann and Schubert\n3) 2 or 3 small one page assignments early on in the semester before the first concert report which amount to nothing, depending on whether he decides to count them. he usually starts the thrashing here.\n4) A final 2 page essay, which counts for about a third of the final, which is the only decent policy he has, because you can do it at home or in your dorm and not in class. Take advantage.\n"

            "review_content": "\nUnfortunately, I have to diagree with the review below.  Perhaps Professor Frisch is a better teacher for classes on Brahms, Music History, and other musicologist based courses, but he is certainly not qualified to teach a class on musical theatre.  Everything in this class was approached from a musicologist's standpoint and not from that of a lover of musical theatre.  Frisch even admitted to not having seen many of the classic shows that we talked about.  And, with the course being called \"The American Musical\" you would think that we would have discussed American shows that made some kind of impact on theatre as an art form.  We didn't discuss A Chorus Line, Dreamgirls, Gypsy, or many of the other classics of theatre.  While the class was incredibly easy, it was a huge bore for anyone who already had any knowledge of musical theatre.  The one class that the TA, Daniel, conducted was much more exciting and passionate.  He should teach the class in the future.  I would recommend this class to anyone under the assumption that Frisch didn't teach it again.\nWorkload:\nWeekly reading (not really necessary since it doesn't come up in class).  Short midterm paper.  review_content of a show of your choice.  10 page paper with topic of your choice.  Very easy final consisting of identifying a few terms and pieces of music.\n"

I definitely hope they have it again in the future. Professor Frisch did a thorough job of covering the best of Broadway from 1900 to the present day and somehow he got THE MOST AWESOME guest lecturers to visit our class! (Kander and Sondheim actually came to our class and answered our questions personally! Ahh! What more could you want from a class? It was amazing! Plus we got to hear from Andy Hammerstein III and a professor from Manhattan School of Music too.) Everybody should write to the music department and tell them to run this class again. The readings were interesting and not overwhelming. Prof Frisch made great use of audio and visual aids in class, and he sent great emails to funny and interesting music-related web links. The work-load was reasonable. The final paper was challenging but I was in love with my topic (we got to choose our own) so it was a joy to write, despite it being stressful (but I think all papers are stressful...). And I must give kudos to the TA, Daniel Callahan, because he was awesome too. He taught one class (and although he was nervous, he was excellent and informative!) and he was super-helpful outside of class too. Okay, I guess I'll wrap it up here although I could go on raving for pages...

He rambles on about history and tangents and does not bother to talk about musical specifics much at all - even though this is what the majority of the midterm and final is about. Worse yet, he grades according to the exact statements he had in mind, while the ones written down could be equally valid. Haughty, insecure, self-centered, and frankly quite unfriendly professor.

Studying for the 2 exams in this class I was amazed at how much I had retained simply from the class meetings.  The exams seemed like good points to consolidate knowledge instead of useless exercises to cram for.  Frisch learns all the students names quickly and is very present in the music department activities, attending student concerts, etc.  One negative note is that because there is only one paper of serious length, 8-10 pages, there is no chance to understand what Frisch expects in such a paper before the graded paper comes back to you near the end of the class.  Don't let his straight forward exams and short papers mislead you, he is a hard grader and expects a lot from the long paper.
