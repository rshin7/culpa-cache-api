            "review_content": "\nFilipcevic is obviously extremely knowledgable about the evolution of film, but I had wished we studied more urban studies topics. This course seems more appropriate as a film course, and I felt a little lost because I had no film background at all. Otherwise, I believe she presents an excellent sampling of films. \nFilipcevic is always willing to meet and talk with you about the class or any problems you might be having. In my experience, she was considerate and understanding.\nHowever, many times she would email us the night before class with reading she wanted done for the next day. She wants discussion, but she has an extremely specific point she is trying to make, and she fishes for this point, at times cutting off people mid-sentence. \nDuring class, she usually reads directly off of her lecture notes, almost always way to fast. \nWorkload:\n3 small (5-7 pgs) papers using only the material read for class, 1 Final (10-12 pgs) with small presentation\n"
