Makes sure we all understand everything before moving on to next point.\nIs clearly interested in the material and tries to spark our interest by tying in modern day examples. \nThe grading can be a bit picky at times but overall I found it fair. No complaints if I did well. \nPrepares us well for the midterms and final by giving us problems to solve (which we go over). \nWorkload:\nan hour long (give or take 20 min) assignment a week. \n"
