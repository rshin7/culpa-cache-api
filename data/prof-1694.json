He'll make time to see you after class, and even makes a joke here and there!!  Organized and good lectures although he seems to be a bit hard on himself, many times he would stop midsentence and say, \"Umm, I didnt expalin that very well, let me try again.\"  And he would, so he gets an A for effort in my book.\nWorkload:\nsurprise quizzes so do the reading, three short papers and final which was cake.\n"
