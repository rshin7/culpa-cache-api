            "review_content": "\nTan Laoshi makes you work HARD but she's great. You'll have about three quizzes a week and two homeworks a week and she expects you to stay on top of things. Her powerpoints are helpful and I feel like she explains grammar well. She's an extremely kind person so go to her office hours if ever you need help studying or going over the material. My only complaint, although this is aimed at the department in general, is that you're not allowed to take home your tests, which means that if you want to look over your tests before the final, you have to go to her office, which is a bit of a pain. \nI highly recommend taking Chinese with Tan Laoshi. It'll be hard but it'll pay off. She's also adorable and makes jokes that noone really gets, but it's cute. \nWorkload:\n3 quizzes and 2 homework sheets per week, a test every three weeks, a final written and oral exam\n"

            "review_content": "\nI'll try to be objective here and let you be the judge:\n1) Tan laoshi used Courseworks frequently. Students had to submit audio recordings on Courseworks; weekly course schedules were posted on Courseworks; and, oh, there were some wallpapers and other departmental announcements which were also posted via Courseworks. I can't emphasize that word any more.\n2) If a professor gives his/her students more assignments than he/she's required, then the professor him/herself will have to bear the extra time to grade the assignments, no doubt. From my past experience, the standard amount of quizzes given by Chinese professors is around 1 quiz per week. Tan laoshi gives 3 quizzes per week with 5 lowest grades dropped. Why would a professor give more quizzes than she's required? Think carefully.\n3) The class environment is quite \"chillax.\" There was probably never a day in which I left that class without having laughed at least once. The amount of laughs that other students got varied but I don't think their gain deviated much from mine.\n4) Tan laoshi directed learning in such a way that encouraged students to actively collaborate. She came up with activities such as making students ask each other questions using required sentence structures, instructing students to practice the texts/dialogues with a partner or nearby classmate, distributing photocopied money to students so they could practice how to use Chinese in buying/selling situations, etc.\n5) If you're absent, Tan laoshi will ask you about it.\n6) If you missed a quiz or failed to submit an assignment, you'll need a legitimate reason for make-up.\n7) She would randomly call on and ask people questions. (She caught me off-guard a few times and I ended up responding like a lost Martian.)\n8) Students respected each other. Nobody would laugh or look down on you if you made mistakes. Life goes on.\n=)\nWorkload:\n3 quizzes per week, weekly diary due every Monday, homework assignment for every chapter, 1 test every 2 chapters, 1 midterm oral presentation, 1 final oral presentation, 1 midterm exam, 1 final exam, various in-class activities.\n"

            "review_content": "\nHighly recommended. Tan Laoshi is lovely: helpful, cheerful and energetic. And so organized! (a pleasant change from last semester). It's true that she gives more work than some of the other teachers; while the extra characters, quizzes and homework assignments may seem excessive at first, they really just force you to space your studying out rather than cramming for the chapter tests as they come. I actually found myself less stressed out by Chinese this semester than last, and somewhat paradoxically I'm pretty sure it's because of the additional work that she assigned.\nShe also has a real sense of humor, which definitely helps. (There's a certain euphemism in Chinese that involves \"eating a woman's tofu\". When we were practicing one day she put up a slide featuring a man and a woman standing on either side of a gigantic block of tofu, which she later admitted was just a trap, so that somebody would say \"\u00e5\u0090\u0192\u00e8\u00b1\u2020\u00e8\u2026\u0090\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 and she could give us a lecture on naughty Chinese).\nI'm really not sure what else to say -- she's friendly but not checked-out, stern without being unreasonable. She even did her best to downplay those ridiculous dialogs that the department makes us memorize, letting us spend more time just talking and practicing on our own. Definitely take this class if you get a chance.\nWorkload:\nAn hour per night, maximum. Don't be scared away -- this is a five-credit course with three and a half credits worth of work.\n"

            "review_content": "\nNot crazy about her... standard Chinese teacher if you know what I mean.  Unlike \"Western\" professors, she doesn't seem to really understand that Chinese is not the only thing we are studying at CU.  If you are doing poorly it is because you \"are not studying enough.\"  This seems a bit ridiculous to me, just because there is a difference between studying and understanding.  Her English is decent, though if you ask her questions she just sort of repeats her former explanation.  Clarity is a bit of an issue for her.  As a student that is not of Asian descent I felt quite disadvantaged.  Many in my class were at least some what familiar with the Chinese language or a derivative of it, so perhaps this is why I had to study about 2x as long as most other students to get the same grade.  For my class she didn't use courseworks and sent us assignments on a weekly basis and although she is adorable and adds little pictures and phrases to the assignment sheets it is annoying to not have all of your work and assignments in one place.  I wanted to like her but she is a bit too harsh for my taste, I wish she would better grasp the CU situation and know that though Chinese is a priority for all, it is not the only course we are enrolled in.\nWorkload:\nStandard Chinese craziness.  Exams, dictation sessions, drill sessions, homework, and extensive memorization.\n"

            "review_content": "\nTan Laoshi is very energetic, engaging and sweet.  She has a good sense of humor, and the little quirky jokes she cracks make learning Chinese a lot more pleasant.  The structure of the class itself is difficult, but Tan Laoshi is very understanding, typically, if students are unable to complete a difficult task and usually has no problem extending the date.  If nothing else, her little smiles of congratulations and frowns of disappointment will guilt you into learning the language.\nWorkload:\nIt's Chinese at Columbia, you get what you sign up for in the workload department.  Big tests, oral exams, little quizzes, although now she's giving 2 times as many quizzes so there will be one every day of class in the next semester, and a final that I thought was easy compared with the rest.\n"
