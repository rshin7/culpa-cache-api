            "review_content": "\nI enjoyed Elsa's Catalan language classes so much that I decided to take her Spanish elective on Intro Catalan Cultures too. Her classes are small, three to ten people, so be prepared to be engaged--and actually learn things that will help you gain a more nuanced, realistic picture of Barcelona and the surrounding Catalonia, plus Valencia, the Balearic Islands and Andorra.  \nTo those who say her courses are too much work, all I can say is you get out what you put in. Do the language work and you'll be having legit conversations by the end of one semester of beginning Catalan. Not even kidding. Elsa gives you all the attention you need to succeed, without ever putting you on the spot. She is kind and motivates you to express yourself, which keeps you on your toes and learning in every moment. \nSame goes for the Spanish elective, though the material is denser by nature. Do the readings and assignments and you'll be surprised by how much they actually connect to life in Barcelona and Catalonia, should you ever have the chance to visit or study abroad there. Sometimes Elsa assigns books, other times movies... either way, it's standard fare for a discussion course, and she's more than happy to guide you and answer questions along the way. She is Catalan and thus cares deeply about the material. If you dedicate time to learning about it, you just might care deeply about it too... And then decide to move to Barcelona. \nWorkload:\nLanguage classes -- the other reviews are accurate. Also, go to the weekly conversation hour at Casa Hispanica called \"Caf\u00e8 Catal\u00e0.\" You'll get extra practice chatting with Elsa and other Catalans (visiting students, instructors, etc.), and free coffee and cookies. Win, win. \nSpanish elective -- mostly writing and participation. Again, do the work and it pays off. The novels I read (one was even in English -- George Orwell \"Homage to Catalonia\") still stick with me. If you could do LitHum and CC, you can handle Elsa's elective. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class was definitely not what I was expecting. I was sold and set on taking this class because of Elsa\u2019s CULPA reviews, but I wish I would have dropped it early in the semester. The first day of class there was about 20 people, but by about week 5 we were down to 4 people. Four people. Elsa said her class was going to be really hard the first day, and she really meant it. She assigns these \u201cpaquete de deberes\u201d which are work packets that are due every class, and oh my god do these take so long to do. They can take anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to do. Sometimes she would assign full documentaries, movies, or her giving an online 2-hour lecture and then you still had to answer questions on the packets. The work for these was excessive, we asked several times if she could assign less work and she promised the class would become easier by halfway through the semester. It never did.\nClass time is always fun, which is probably the reason why I stayed. During class all we do is talk to a classmate about what we learned doing the paquete and she would answer questions we had. It would get slightly uncomfortable since there was only 4 of us and she could easily hear what we were saying, and every time we said something incorrectly she would write the correct word on the board. In such a small class you could not get away with not doing the assigned work. Her questions during class were so specific that it required doing the homework with extra attention. \nThere are no quizzes or exams for this class, but there were 3 essays and 2 projects which required lots of time to do. The essays were short compositions, and she allowed 1 rewrite after giving you corrections. The corrections she gave back usually included 2 pages of her comments in red ink, which didn\u2019t always seem constructive and bordered on being too harsh. Her midterm project and final were very tedious and took days to complete.\nElsa is a great instructor. She really does mean well and she wants you to learn. She\u2019s kind and engaging, but I think she\u2019s too eager and has unrealistic expectations for her students. This might have been her first time teaching in Spanish, and even though it\u2019s a 3300 level-course, it was just too much. If you\u2019re still interested in taking this class try it out for 2 weeks, and if it seems like a lot, drop it. The work will only get harder during the semester. \nWorkload:\n25%-Participation\n20%-Paquete de Deberes\n15%-Compositions\n5%-Oral Presentation, very easy, 5 min presentation on a topic, low stress\n15%-Midterm Project\n20%-Final Project\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nAs a senior, I can say I have taken my fair share of classes at Columbia University. And Elsa is, by far, the best teacher/professor I have ever had.\nComprehensive Beg Catalan with Elsa was unlike attending class. It was like coming home to a group of friends after a long day. However, that is not to say it was all fun and games because serious learning did occur. There is a lot of material covered throughout this class and it is important to keep up - but learning with Elsa is so much fun that reviewing for class is exciting, not taxing. A 1:50 block of class FLIES by. Never once did I watch the clock (except maybe during the midterm and final).\nI'm not one of those students who locks themselves in the library and goes above and beyond in all of their classes. I'm your average joe, so trust me, this class is inspiring.\nElsa is amazing. She responds promptly to emails and encourages class participation. No questions are ever stupid and no email is ever ignored. She has an innate ability to inspire a genuine desire for learning within her students. All of my friends and family know Elsa's name because I constantly talk about how much I love her. She is truly one of a kind - the Hispanic Studies department needs more Elsas! \nAlthough I have a few regrets from my time here at Columbia, perhaps my biggest regret is not discovering Elsa and her classes sooner. I took Catalan as a last ditch effort when some of my other classes did not work out...and it was the best decision of my Columbia career! \nI have learned so much about a culture and language I onced disliked. I have completely fallen in love with Catalan and Catalonia. And Elsa has 100% stollen my heart as the sweetest and best instructor on Columbia's campus.\n\nWorkload:\nWorkload can be as much or as little as you desire, because the homework usually takes less than 1 hour (worksheets, etc.).\nOverview:\n- Worksheets and short essays due before most classes (fun! and definitely do-able)\n- Midterm\n- Oral presentation (powerpoint presentation of 5-7 minutes)\n- Oral exam (5 minutes with a partner & 1 minute by yourself describing a picture)\n- Final\n- Class participation! (big chunk of the grade and super easy to do well in because she is encouraging and class is fun)\nHer tests are long and it is important to stay on top of things. As I said, you learn a lot in the class. I made notecards after every class and reviewed them (However, no one else that I know of did this). I found her tests to be fair. Nonetheless, others found her tests to be harder than she let on.\n"

            "review_content": "\nElsa is by far my favorite professor at Columbia. Because classes tend to be small, her teaching style is very interactive and personalized. She always finds engaging ways to present the material, so class is never boring. Even if you hadn't heard of Catalan before, you'll find yourself picking it up in no time. I look forward to class each week, and\nthe two hours always seem to fly by.\nIt's obvious how much Elsa cares about her students. She genuinely tries to get to know each person, and will always take time to ask if you're okay when you seem like you're having a bad day. She's also super cool and funny, and I'm pretty sure everyone secretly wants to be her best friend.\nI highly recommend taking Catalan with Elsa. Not only will you get to know a great professor and bond with classmates, but you'll also learn a lot about Catalan and Spanish culture. Whether you're a Hispanic Studies major or have never taken a Spanish class in your life, you won't regret taking this class!\nWorkload:\nLike the other reviews say, Elsa does not assign busy work. In addition to small homework assignments and compositions, there's a midterm, final, and oral presentation. Exams are not easy and require studying and memorization. However, participation weighs a lot and can help if you don't do the best on an exam.\n"

            "review_content": "\nIf you're going to study abroad in Barcelona, it is IMPERATIVE that you take a semester or two (actually, you really should take both Comprehensive Beginning Catalan and Intermediate I) of Catalan. You won't regret it, I promise you. Even if you have an interest in Spain (and you want to study abroad in Madrid, Sevilla, or somewhere), I highly recommend taking Catalan because you'll be able to have a greater understanding of Spanish culture through studying Catalan. Catalan is amazing, especially with ELSA, who makes the two-hour classes worthwhile.\n As it has been said in the last review, Catalan is NOT a dialect of Spanish; it's its own language which is fundamental in order to really get to appreciate Barcelona. Elsa is one of the best professors that I've ever had at Columbia, and they will be the most fun two hours of class you'll have that day. After two semesters, I have been able to pick up a lot of the language (full disclosure: I am fully fluent in Spanish) and have had the opportunity to become confident in my speaking abilities by going to Caf\u00c3\u00a8 Catal\u00c3\u00a0 in Casa Hisp\u00c3\u00a1nica and meeting Catalan expats in the city.\nIn addition, if you want to be in a class where you really get to know your classmates and professor (and feel like family), this is the class for you. While my first semester had 8 students, my second semester had 4, and the classes generally tend to be smaller (more like 4, 5, 6 or sometimes there are even 2). \nEstudiu catal\u00c3\u00a0, si us plau! (Study Catalan, please!)\nWorkload:\nElsa is not about busy work; all of the assignments are designed to improve your ability, and learning languages require lots of practice. In addition to homework assignments, there are compositions periodically assigned (there are more in Intermediate) with a opportunity to make revisions on a second draft, a midterm, an oral presentation, and a final. In addition, PARTICIPATION is key whether it be in a class discussion or \n"

If you want to learn the most beautiful language in the world, this is the class for you. (Fine, debatable. You should take this class and judge for yourself.)\nIf you're an intimidated freshman looking for that bff professor, take Catalan.\nIf you're a spanish major, take Catalan. *The comprehensive class will count towards your major/concentration.\nIf you're planning to study abroad in Barcelona, take Catalan!! (Believe it or not, spanish is NOT the only language spoken there. Barcelonins may or may not love you a little bit more if you show off your Catalan skills.)\nIf you're looking for a foreign language for your core, take Catalan. \nElsa will make the class fun and I promise you'll love her. \nPS. Catalan is not a dialect of Spanish. And Bar\u00c3\u00a7a is the abbrev for FC Barcelona, not the city. \nPPS. Culpa, you should modify spanish+port to span+port+catl. Just saying. \nWorkload:\nElsa is not about busy work. She will assign enough work for you to really learn the language. Her class is very interactive because she wants you to get comfortable speaking the language. (Plus, your class will become like a family.) Yes, you do have a midterm + final but, if you attend class, pay attention, and do your homework, you'll be fine. One oral presentation per semester. No need to purchase any books (because they're expensive. Elsa will provide all of the worksheets you need.) \nShe really just wants you to learn the language and have fun doing it. \n"

Class with her is always fun and engaging, and I've never had the experience of picking up a language so easily. It helps to have studied Spanish in the past, which all of my classmates and I had, but being a fluent Spanish speaker doesn't give anyone an edge over the other students-- just having a solid understanding of a romance language is enough, and Elsa does the rest. She's my favorite professor at Columbia by far; everyone should do themselves the favor of taking a class with her. \nWorkload:\nTotally manageable. Usually a short excercise or worksheet after each class, a couple of 1.5-pg compositions a semester, a midterm and a final. Participation weighs really heavily with Elsa too, so if you talk a lot in class but just can't figure out Catalan pronouns on your exams, you should be ok. \n"
