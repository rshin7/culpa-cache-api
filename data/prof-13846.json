            "review_content": "\nI found this to be a great lecture. It really provides a strong grounding in Latin American history, through the lens of cities. The course covers urban history from the colonial period to our days. Because much ground is being covered, this is a fast paced course. Yet the professor accounts for this, by providing contextual knowledge. Therefore you don't need to be an expert in Latin American history to take this course. Yet \nWorkload:\nReadings for each of the two lectures a week. (Fairly doable)\n- Map quiz\n- Midterm (memorize a list of IDs, and answer one essay question)\n- Primary Source Essay\n- Final (IDs and a few Essays)\nIt's all very doable, and worth it!! \n"
