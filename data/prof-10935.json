            "review_content": "\nProfessor Myers was a good teacher. She explained things very clearly in class, provided a lot of examples ranging in difficulty, and her problems reflected applications in industry. Her midterm and non-cumulative final (i.e. a second midterm) aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t super hard. The second one is easier because the material is easier and there is less material due to more guest lecturers. Thus, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice that the second half of her class is more chill than the first, because most other courses are the opposite. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree with other reviewers that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to study for the midterm and final. You should study for them, but you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to study for them as much as, say, a physics midterm or final. Definitely study more for the midterm. The guest lecturers were usually quite interesting, and I think they added a lot to the course. The problem sets in this class aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too difficult but you still learn from them. Overall, I found this a helpful class for learning about mechanical engineering in a low stress environment. If you are unsure about MechE, like myself, I would recommend this class in a heartbeat. \nWorkload:\n30% Problem Sets, 20% each for midterm and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153final\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, 25% final project, 5% participation. Final project is due before thanksgiving and there are no problem sets during that time so managing a project and a final isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad at all. \n"

            "review_content": "\nOverall, Prof Myers was a great professor. She is always willing to answer any question you may have.\nProf Myers basically does everything she can to give everyone an A because (1) she gives you the opportunity to use a cheat sheet during the midterm and final, (2) she makes her exams really easy, and (3) she is lenient when it comes to grading the final project that you have to do at the end of the semester.  The class is a GPA booster, but you have to work for it.  It helps if you've taken AP Physics B.\n\nWorkload:\nProblem set due every week (some problems are a little difficult and can take some time), 30%\nMidterm (easier than or same level as the problem sets), 25%\nFinal Project (it consumes some time), 20%\nFinal Exam (same level of difficulty as midterm), 25%\n"

            "review_content": "\nSuper Amazing teacher!!\nHer teaching method is clear and to the point.\nShe writes copious notes on the board for a subject that is not too difficult.\nThis class boost your GPA if you just pay attention, come to class, copy down her notes and refer back to them for problem sets.\nThe midterm and exam are super easy.\nIf you know the tiniest smidgeon of physics, you'll be golden.  And if not, you'll still make an A if you put in a bit of effort.\nShe also makes many tangents during class to her own research and world problems.  While at first she may seem a bit conceited, you'll relaize that that assertiveness is what makes her a great teacher. She'll give it to you straight, and if you listen, you'll win.\nWorkload:\nA problem set every week or so that takes from 30 to 120 minutes.\nNo studying needed for midterm and exam if you the exam sheets.\nWonderful class, learned alot with minimal effort.\n"
