It is not a good way to spend your time. Try enrolling in a class that is taught by a person exhibiting some leadership and organizational ability. Please do not read any reviews that are positive.

To be totally honest, it was almost as if we as students were expected to understand spanish as if we were fluent, before even entering the class, DESPITE the fact that this TEACHER CAN'T EVEN SPEAK SPANISH. She has trouble, HUGE trouble, stringing together multiple sentences on a consistent basis. It is frustrating and unremittingly difficult to speak with this person, as she has virtually NO SOCIAL ABILITY TO CONVERSE WITH HUMAN BEINGS. I find it unwise to enroll in this class. There is nothing to gain from a teacher that has nothing to teach. She is not spanish, she is barely able to speak spanish, her obvious american accent is ridiculously unkempt, and worst of all, she knows close to nothing about how to teach a class. My goodness. Teaching means teaching, not reading word for word from your textbook all the time.\nWorkload:\nsomewhat overdone\n"

            "review_content": "\nTo be Fair\nBefore the beginning of each semester, Professor Borgman sends out an email to all of her students warning that the class will be fairly difficult and fast-paced. She also reminds us that the course is intended for those that have already been exposed to the language and have a decent grasp on it. Students that have had little to no exposure to the language, however, are focused on the \"Beginning\" part of the course title, instead of the \"Comprehensive\" and stay despite Borgman's warning. Or perhaps this may be their last year to complete Columbia's language requirement, and thus, have no choice. Despite the reason, these students are usually the ones that experience difficulty throughout the semester.\nBorgman speaks in Spanish a great deal of the time. She switches to English for students that have difficulty speaking/understanding the language, which is nothing negative on her part. She tries to cater to the students' needs, while at the same time encouraging them to speak in Spanish. \nCons\nWith that said, Professor Borgman is by no means perfect. She has great difficulty explaining grammatical concepts and rely on other students that excel within the class to explain the concepts for her. When confronted with grammatical inconsistencies in the language, she gives the right answer, but if you continue to push, she is very easily overwhelmed and instead validates the wrong answer proposed by the confused student, thereby confusing the entire class. When reviewing a test, students hand in their tests and tell her that she graded incorrectly. She very easily changes the grade, despite the fact that sometimes the student really is wrong. This, I attribute to a flaw in character, as she needs to be much more confident and assertive in delivering the material. I have no doubt that Professor Borgman is fluent in Spanish. She just isn't fluent in particular aspects of teaching it. \nPros\nShe does, however, have redeeming qualities. I thoroughly enjoyed the cultural aspects of the class. Every few weeks, Professor Borgman spends an entire class on dissecting the language and meaning of Spanish songs by Juanes, Celia Cruz, etc. It might not be your cup of tea, but in terms of an integrative approach to learning Spanish, it was pretty awesome. In fact, the entire course is structured in an integrative manner rather than an instrumental one, as it is centered more around cultural and idiomatic expressions in Spanish. Learning the tenses and grammar seems to be more a review of something that has already been learned previously. \nHonestly, I think this is what oftentimes throws students off who have learned Spanish in a more basic and chronological manner (i.e. present tense > imperative > preterite > imperfect > future > conditional). An integrative approach is slightly more confusing as it assumes that the student already has a grasp on the tenses (which was what the course was designed for). My Spanish improved tremendously within one semester due to this approach.\nFinally, in terms of grading, I think Professor Borgman really is fair in terms of grading based on effort. If you truly show that you care, and you actually do your homework and speak to her during office hours, your grade will reflect that. This would be particularly helpful to those that spend most of their time complaining about Borgman's grading system. If she were to grade based on test scores, those students would fail. \n______________________________________________________________________\nNote: Homework assignments from MySpanishLab aren't particularly useful, as the program allows you to try as many times as you like, and eventually gives you the answer. \nI hope I've given you the tools you need to make your decision on whether or not this course is for you. I do agree that it is not for everyone, but I definitely wanted to point out certain pros that previous reviewers have not. It's far from being all bad. \nWorkload:\nVery manageable: MySpanishLab assignments (easy), occasional worksheets, 2 quizzes, 1 midterm, 1 written final, 1 oral final, 1 oral presentation - Grading is very lenient for the orals and homework assignments are very easy (see note above).\n"

            "review_content": "\nI just want to say that all the negative reviews below are fairly accurate. \nShe is not a qualified spanish instructor, period.\nShe doesn't explain, and doesn't know how to explain, any, and all aspects of the fundamentals of spanish grammar, either in the colloquial/vernacular sense, nor in the formal/written. She rarely converses in spanish.\nGrading is rarely based on performance on a test/exam, but on whether the teacher thinks you like her or not. This usually works, since on written portions of exams, she can literally alter the grade down enough for the objective portions (multiple choice) to get compromised, regardless of performance on the exam as a whole.\nLet's just say she is an unorthodox teacher, with a fairly weird way of going about grading/teaching/organizing class time and the class syllabus. The only problem is that students shouldn't have to get caught up in this type of class. If there is any purpose for culpa reviews, it shouldn't just be to assail and warn you of horrible, horrible wackos, and vice versa for good teachers, but to inform the reader of what they are getting themselves into. When I say don't sign up for this class, please, please, don't do it. It's not ok to say, well, you just want to try it out to see what these reviews are about, or, to say, well, there aren't any other sections of the class which fit your schedule. In all honesty, if this is the case, don't even take spanish! You came to Columbia, you are in an Ivy, a prominent one at that, you are paying 55 grand a year to come here, and I'd be damned if another student gets caught up in a class which reminds you of being back in a public middleschool, with the worst middle-school teacher on campus!

I guess i thought i might give her a chance after assuming she needed time to feel more comfortable. How wrong i was.\nAll you do in class is go around in a circle answering the homework questions from the night before. It is absurdly tedious and annoying to cooperate under this sub-highschool standard classroom environment. You feel like you are back in middle-school. How much can you actually learn going around in a circle spitting out what you already wrote on a paper the night before. Class is an absurd waste of time, and it doesnt quite make sense how if you are late to them, your grade goes down. Your grade is based on whether or not your voice in class sounds enthusiastic when it's your turn to talk. She has a false idea about what it takes to learn a language, and firmly believes that it has to do with how good you are at faking a spanish accent, as opposed to what words come out of your mouth. Figure this out for yourself if you wish, because the only students with a decent grade will be the ones who speak with fervor, and act as superficially spanish as possible (nothing wrong with this! They are good fakers, that's all, and i'm just saying that this ability shouldn't be why they get A's!)\nI don't mean to be rude, but, spanish students, beware!\nWorkload:\nnot to bad, but the teacher is the problem\n"

She is not evil or out to get you... just do not get her angry by having half the class not do homework ... she does not appreciate it (Who would?) and at one point this semester she almost lost her cool. Besides that, she's always smiling and seems to enjoy what she is doing. \nWhat I did not think was too effective was the fact that she did not have a set schedule of things for us to do. Sometimes we actually had to ask about what we would do during a particular class, because you could sort of sway her to do anything. \nShe allows you to rewrite all your essays, and wants to help you out. I liked that we spoke Spanish nearly all the time. However, she will let you speak in English if you ask and have something complicated to say.\nShe's also the only prof. this semester to have allowed my class to go outside for a session on Hamilton Lawn. That was very nice of her. \nOverall, I think her class is fairly simple - no worries taking a class with Borgman. \nWorkload:\nNot much at all. About 5 or 6 compositions total, 400 words each or so. However, the rest of the time we would either have MySPANLAB homework which she did not check, or 3 exercises or so in one of the spanish books. She does tend to collect homework, so it's a good idea to do the ones with multiple questions on text or any of the movies. Also, one final project at the end. This year in pairs we picked a neighborhood and did a powerpoint/written assignment on it. It was actually pretty fun.\n"

It was no less so with the societies that predated the Incas, those of Chavin, Nazca, Tiahuanaco  and, ultimately, the Incan Impire and its disintegration after the arrival of the Europeans.
