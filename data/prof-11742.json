            "review_content": "\nI am so lucky to have gotten Gabi.  She is young and very eccentric.  The class itself is very typical of Intermediate French I - appropriating the right amount of time to converse, versus to teach grammar.  However, Gabi is SO CHILL about everything.  She puts due dates for the online Quia exercises, but she doesn't care when you do them as long as you get them done.  We signed up time slots for an oral presentation, but she literally did not care when you presented.  One group did it the last day of class.  Also, instead of having 5 essays and an oral presentation, we had like 3 essays and a oral presentation that replaced one of the essays.  She grades the essays very easily.\nShe's also REALLY into movies/ independent films.  Every two weeks, she offers extra credit to meet in a room in Hamilton and watch a French movie.  Super chill.  She calls it \"Cinema Club.\"  There was also like a German movie festival or something at Lincoln Center and she gave extra credit to people who went to it and wrote a review.  So it's very easy to do well in this class as long as you put the work in to learn the vocab and grammar for the exams.  Intermediate I has a lot of review of Beginner I and II in it, while also introducing new topics, so it's a great transition course.\nWorkload:\nStandard.  those stupid online Quia exercises, essays, and like 4 exams + final. LEARN THE VOCAB AND GRAMMAR.\n"
