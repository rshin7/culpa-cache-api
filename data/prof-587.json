            "review_content": "\nProfessor Somerville is extraordinarily knowledgeable. He speaks articulately and strives to answer students' questions as thoroughly as possible. Still, he is honest enough to say \"I don't know, but I will try to answer as best I can\" when students want to know about something that is not very familiar to him. He is poised and direct but has a very dry sense of humor that can be truly delightful. He isn't cold or unkind, but he rarely smiles, so that, every time I achieved a smile (through hard work and my own rather dry sense of humor) from Professor Somerville, I felt truly rewarded.\nI don't know what the TA situation is going to look like in coming semesters. One TA was bright, engaged, and kind; the other was cold, rude, and bored. If you meet the TAs and feel strongly about one or the other, even based purely on instinct, try to take a discussion section with the one you like. As in any class, this can really make a difference as the semester moves forward; I dreaded my discussion sections because I did not listen to my instincts.\nFinally, I would like to say a word about other reviews here, because a lot of them mention that Professor Somerville is boring - or at least that the topic is boring. My earnest advice to anyone thinking of signing up for this course is to take thorough notes, review them comprehensively, and ask Professor Somerville or one of the TAs (again, preferably whichever you like best) about any topic that seems confusing to you. The material is only boring if you enter the class thinking, \"This material is going to be boring.\" I advise any prospective student not to think that way: enter with an open mind and let yourself get excited about the richly complex history of the Christian religion.\nWorkload:\nThere are two midterms, both of which do require scrupulous study. Again, take notes and review them more than once.\nThere is one final, which is not agonizingly hard if you prepare well for it. Look at your notes and (re)read the material that Professor Somerville assigns (yes, do your best to read all of it. There are a lot of books he insists upon, and I don't believe you will have to read every last paragraph in order to succeed, but you should try your best to do so.) My class received a study guide before the final, and I found it invaluable. Make sure to show up to class on that day!\nAs indicated above, there is a great deal of reading. The reviews before mine don't lie about the enormous amount of literature to which the class is exposed. This is, naturally, both a blessing and a curse; it is fascinating material but there is a lot of it. Again, don't push yourself too hard, but read as much as you possibly can: it makes a tremendous difference. You'll be solidly prepared for both the lectures and the tests if you keep up with the reading.\nFinally, make sure to attend the (mandatory) tour at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine when the time comes to study religious art and architecture. Our class was led by the Reverend Dr. Andrew C. Blume, who was dynamic, witty, and articulate when he guided us through the cathedral. Professor Somerville asked students to compose a one-page response to the tour, citing the topics that most intrigued us. The paper was not graded but every student had to submit it. Make sure you're there.\n"

            "review_content": "\nBefore I delve into this review, let me state that this was one of the most average classes I took while a carefree coed at CU. The class's contents were intrinsically boring, as nothing that has occurred historically prior to 1986 is at all interesting. That said, it's saving grace \u00e2\u20ac\u201dits savior, if you will\u00e2\u20ac\u201d came in the form of its impressive prof.\nOl' Bob Sommerville is commendable for a number of reasons, not least among them his remarkable age. Born before reliable record keeping, it's unknown how old he is, but rest assured, he is a primary source on biblical studies. Every day he walks into class, it's a goddamn miracle. I theorize that he has been dead for some time, but that his synapses still errantly fire, his daily affairs sorted our by dying muscle memory.\nHe knows how to captivate a classroom, only to trail off at the end of his statement, rendering the preceding background information useless. Furthermore, he gets a ton of mileage off self-disparaging regarding his age and death. Like any good biblical scholar, he has ammassed a following of effeminate graduate student followers, and for his class's TA's he selects the meekest members of his intellectual harem.\nOf course, Bobby S. does toss you the occasional curveball by wearing a backward baseball cap or vomiting up blood in class, and for these reasons I rate the class 4/5 stars. Would take again. \nWorkload:\nLight. Never did the readings. Two easy midterms and a final. Sections that I have no idea if you have to go to. I did but I don't think I got anything out of them. \n"

            "review_content": "\nIt's true that Prof. Somerville's lectures are pretty dry, but the material is definitely interesting if you care about the subject.  I personally am a devout Catholic and was fascinated to see how Christianity would be portrayed here differently than in my high school theology classes.  There were some clear differences.  For one thing, we didn't use the word \"heresy\" but instead said \"form of Christianity prevalent before the formation of a formalized orthodox consensus\".  It was also a much less streamlined history than I was used to; it wasn't all aimed at \"where we are now\" because the course obviously doesn't presume its students have any relationship with the Christian faith.  That said, Somerville was very fair to the faith, not at all judgmental of believers and not at all \"blasphemous\" by the believers' standpoint.\nThe class is VERY historical and not very theological.\nGet Todd French as your TA.  If he isn't, change discussion sections.  He's awesome.  He's laid back but brilliant.  Todd Berzon is also awesome but SO INTIMIDATING and seems like a MUCH harder grader.\nLots of interesting guest lectures that ARE ON THE FINAL.\nStudy hard for the quizzes.  Study in advance for the final and plan your essays well.\nRead all the packet assignments and read the discussion section works.\nWorkload:\nINSANE AMOUNT OF READING, but the only necessary part is the course pack.  I look forward to reading the five other textbooks this summer when I have time, but GET REAL.  No one can do that much reading during the year.\nTwo quizzes.

He does deliver whole lectures without notes, filled to the brim with facts, helpfully writes the main points on the boards, tells adorably corny jokes, and is an overall nice guy.\nThe TA's too: nice and approachable, if just a little awkward, guys. Extremely, if just a little scarily, intelligent too. Who speaks 7 languages including Aramaic? \nThat said: the class. Its a little boring. For the sake of your grade, you should probably attend every lecture, but sometimes that seems overwhelmingly painful to do. But you should do it. The class can be interesting (especially if you are at all familiar with modern Catholicism), but sometimes spending a whole class on the inclusion of two words into the Nicaean Creed can be.... excruciating (etymology joke for y'all). At other times though, like I said, if you're  familiar with modern Catholicism, the  reason for  some obscure thing will just click, and you'll find yourself noticing it in every mass you go to thereafter. If you're not Catholic though, I don't know how interesting that would be.\nThere's not a lot of work, that's true. But that's  not to say the little bit of work you have is graded easily. Its not. Two midterms worth 25% each, and a final worth 50%, with the question \"read this passage and relate its importance to Christianity\" sounds easy, but you're expected to  include EVERY RELEVANT PIECE OF INFORMATION. A text analysis, text summary, historical context (past, present, and future  consequences of the text), other movements  it was related to, etc. Really hard. I think most people were unpleasantly surprised at the grades they received on them (especially since these expectations weren't related to you till after the test). Easy A? Pah. 16% A's does not an easy A make. \nFinal word of caution: the syllabus will craftily inform you that attendance of discussion sections is not mandatory, and not attending \"will not hurt your final grade\". But that's not entirely true. Say you received B+'s on your two midterms, and a B on your final. 50/50. If you attended discussion sections, your final grade will  be a B+. If you didn't, B. This criterion as part of your final grade is also conveniently never mentioned. And sucks. Go to the discussion section. There's only 4 anyway.\nOverall: Bobby's great, the TA's are great, but going to a pretty boring class twice a week where 84% receive less than an A? Why would you do that?   \n"

The only reason I can come up with that people think he is boring is that they are simply uninterested in the material. If you have more than a passing interest in Christianity, the class is a must. Somerville made me a religion major by presenting thoughtful, intelligent analysis of the roots of Christianity. He's a giant in his field, and with good reason: he knows his stuff and communicates it well. Taking something from this man should be a requirement for religion majors, and strongly recommended for everyone else--these are the types of classes we came to Columbia to experience.\nWorkload:\nChristianity is easy--two \"quizzes\" (one multiple choice, one IDs), a short paper on St. John the Divine, and a relatively simple final.

His lectures are very straightforward, and he writes the key terms on the board before class, so if you write them down, your notes will be in very good order and chronological for the most part.  This course is more of a History-based Christianity course than a Religion-based one... not too much theology but it is still very interesting.  This is probably because Somerville is a religious historian.  Nevertheless, this is good for history majors as it can be used to fulfill part of the major requirement. Somerville's lectures are great, and he had 4 guest lecturers (2 of whom were TAs), and each of them added another facet to the class, ranging from Dr. Boynton's lecture on Music in the Church, complete with sound clips of psalms, to Steven Schoenig SJ's lecture on St. Ignatius and the Jesuits.  The reading may seem heavy, but he usually writes the reference book & pages where you can find more info about a key item, so you can usually look it up rather than reading the whole book, although some of the course books are really interesting.  He has everyone buy a course reader (and apologizes profusely over the $25 cost), which is composed of primary sources ranging from the Didache to writings of Martin Luther, and he goes over some in class.  2All of these readings create further understanding of the lecture, and they are really helpful to read right after his lectures.  There are 6 additional books, 3 of which are sort of reference about the time period (2 are good, one's pretty dense), and 3 shorter books, 2 used for discussion sections and one used for the alternative paper.  All of these are really interesting.  As far as his exams go, they're pretty fair, and it is definitely ideal to go to the lectures as it's easier to make connections between what he says and what the books say, as they're more complementary than anything.  And if you don't go, then you're missing out on one of Columbia's clearest, most dedicated lecturers and professors. \nWorkload:\n2 \"quizzes\" (1/2 hr each), final.  The first quiz was IDs, the second was True-False, but the results on the second one were so varied that he offered a \"balanced retake\" and will probably not use this format again.  The final was pretty difficult, although he gave the essay questions (which equated to appx 60% of the test) ahead of time.  Discussion sections, which meet 4x during the semester, discuss primary sources (Rule of St. Benedict, St. Francis of Assisi, Martyrdom of Perpetua, Calvin/Satoledo) and participation in these helps your grade, but are not mandatory.  Also, in lieu of the second test you can opt to write a paper/ reaction/ review  up to 8pgs on Chesterton's St. Francis of Assisi.\n"

Not the most animated lecturer, he occasionally throws in a miserably humorless joke from religion circles. A nice, helpful man, there's nothing to be said against him. The reading is not crucial to success (gradewise) although some short texts must be read. Fortunately it's not hard to figure out which ones are important. The discussion sections are vital if you want to do well on the two quizzes (short essay questions), and they help for the final too. I didn't come off very pleased with the course, though I must say that Christianity isn't my thing. One problem that frustrates me: I still have no clear idea of what Christianity is.\nWorkload:\nTwo short quizzes, a one-page description of anything in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.\n"
