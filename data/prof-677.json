            "review_content": "\nTakes the class seriously, but makes a good effort to make it interesting to students. She knows a lot about music, and she tries to encourage class discussion both on particular pieces and on the greater issues of music and music hum. Generally, class was relatively interesting, and students were involved. She was always trying to give us opportunities to explore more contemporary music, as she realized that the course didn't really cover that at all. The workload is fairly light/moderate, and the grading is fair. Doing the short written HW assignment every night became a little annoying after a while, but it did help you to actually absorb something from the reading, which was helpful for the midterm and final. She was also always open to suggestions and comments from the class. Like most music hum sections, the class can start to feel a little long at times, but overall, it was ok.\nWorkload:\nReading/listening/short written HW for every class, a concert report (3-5 pages), a research paper (4-5 on absolutely anything related to music), a midterm and a final (non-culmulative). Class participation and attendence necessary.\n"
