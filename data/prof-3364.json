Generally speaking, he's great when you have no idea what the hell Stoic physics is, or how teleology relates to necessity. He'll walk you through your papers or the reading (within reason). In terms of grading, he wasn't too terribly difficult. I had trouble adjusting to what he was looking for, but once I had it was easy sailing. Definitely the best TA in the class.\n"
