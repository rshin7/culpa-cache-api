However, in spite of the ridiculous horrible nature of this course, Jeno made it actually interesting. On each homework assignment she let us go talk to her and she would give us all our points back, and she is extremely accessible to go over any topics you might have missed (which makes lecture completely unnecessary). She's also brilliant, so she knows what she's talking about.\nWorkload:\nFrontiers stuff, most of it negligible.  A couple presentations. Really easy to do nothing and get a B, really hard to work towards an A.\n"

The lectures and material can get dull, but Jeno keeps the class interesting. She is also very helpful outside of class, holding frequent office hours. She is a fair and easy grader and a nice person and general. Jeno is a keeper.  \nWorkload:\n1 problem set per week (they aren't that bad and Jeno is available for extra help),1 in class presentation, department midterm, department final\n"
