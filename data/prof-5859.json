            "review_content": "\nStefano was an awesome TA because he not only explained theory and problems very clearly, but asked for and cared about your opinion. Instead of regurgitation, as many intro-level courses are, he led the class to examine critically and debate different theories and ongoing events. \nHe's very organized and enthusiastic about teaching, which makes for a pleasant experience. He's also a very fair grader and offers a lot of constructive comments to improve your analysis. \nWorkload:\n3 2-page papers; take-home midterm; in class final exam; participation helps. \n"
