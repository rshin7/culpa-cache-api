            "review_content": "\nNancy is amazing.  At first she annoyed me a bit.. she always asks, \"do you know..?\"  But then I realized she has so much knowledge and compassion, and she just has her own style.  She is a writer herself, and a Barnard grad, and she clearly thinks Barnard women are the best there are.  She takes the process of writing very seriously, and she views you not as a student spitting out words but as a creator.  This class is very creative and you read some great books - lots of Hemingway and Stein.  I couldn't have taken a better first year seminar and I can't wait to take more classes with Nancy.\nWorkload:\n1 creative writing piece, 3 5-page essays on the novels we read, response journals for every book (I think we read 7), and one 5-10 minute presentation on some aspect of modernism.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI can't believe no one has written about her yet. She is fabulous, articulate, sweet, and intelligent. I loved her and her class. If she seems like a tough grader or critical, it's only because she expects a lot from her students and really cares.\n"
