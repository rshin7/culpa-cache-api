He has the qualities of a really good TA - he's approachable, he's attentive in lecture (which makes it easy for us to go over course material in recitation rather than just hearing his point on everything) and he helped us a lot with our papers.  However, he didn't know much more about Islam than the rest of us, which could be frustrating at times.  Nonetheless, I would be happy if I had him for another class.\nWorkload:\nIslam course - 4 8 page papers, midterm, final, a lot of reading\n"
