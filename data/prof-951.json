            "review_content": "\nI agree with most of the other reviews that say Rayo is an easy grader and enjoys goofiness in class. I also agree that, in her class, you will most likely not learn much Spanish.  However, there are shades of gray: before coming to her class I never knew certain tenses in Spanish even existed, and this class is where I finally learned them.  Of course, with Rayo's haphazard teaching style that doesn't really reach the students at their level (she either aims too high, thinking we know more than we do, or too low, thinking we know less than we do), it was DIFFICULT to learn those new tenses--but I learned them eventually.\nBasically, this is not a hard class.  She goes over the language itself somewhat (or she tries to, at least), but most of the time you can just say \"como se dice ___?\" and she will not only fill in the blank for you but go off on a talkative tangent about the first indiginous president of Bolivia or the tango.  All you have to do at those times is sit and half-listen.\nWorkload:\nPretty light; usually she tells you to read a section of the textbook before the next class, but since it is discussed in class you can skip most of the reading.  However, the written compositions should be done with at least a little seriousness since she sets word counts and expects you to have better grammar than she teaches you during the semester.\n"

            "review_content": "\nSenora Rayo is a generous grader - getting an A is not too difficult. However, she does not enforce the speaking of spanish in her class. Given that this is the last semester of spanish in which students are to be learning grammar, not speaking spanish in class poses a big problem. Also, only 2 days of class in the semester we dedicated to discussing the spanish language. If you want to perfect your spanish, this is certainly not the right class for you. Easy A? It's nce, but not worth it.\nWorkload:\nVery light. Must watch and comprehend 3 movies in spanish. 4 ~500 word compositions are required, but I believe most other classes do 6. \n"

Will not teach you a lick of spanish, but will sit and entertain you with poetry, movies, and theater. Great class if you don't care about learning Spanish and just want to get your language requirement overwith. If you are at all interested in the aforementioned, AVOID THIS CLASS! My Spanish is worse for it. That said, the class definitely had its memorable moments. Nobody will let you get away with as much silliness as Rayo (in both classroom activities and presentations) - she gets a kick out of it. Also, she is an extremely generous grader, especially on your overall grade. Spanish with Rayo is an experience, but not necessarily an educational one.\nWorkload:\nThere are assignments listed in the syllabus, but she never checks anything, and class almost always goes off on a tangent or moves slowly. Essentially, you never have to do anything, execpt for: two exams during term, oral and written final, and three essays.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Rayo is sweet, but flakey, and fairly intimidating. This was the first Spanish class I took coming into Barnard, and I was pretty disappointed when I realized that AP Spanish was more difficult. Though it is meant to be a discussion-based class, Rayo has a habit of spending most of the class going off on tangents that vary from fascinating to painfully dull. She is not very helpful with grammar; that said, most people who take this class are far enough in their Spanish studies that they do not need much help. She does meet with everyone after the first paper is handed back to get to know us and go over our mistakes, which I found very helpful and nice of her. She is always available during office hours for those students who made need extra help with their writing. \nThat said, I don't think I learned much of anything in her class, but I did get an A.\nWorkload:\nEasy. 3 papers, maybe 4. Light reading, but it doesn't seem to matter much if you do it. Attendance is mandatory.\n"

However, I found the material for this class to be excessively boring and unnecessary.  Topics were never given the right amount of time; either we spent wayyy to much time on it (like Frida Kahlo) or wayyy to little (like some of the poets).  If you're really interested in reading Latin American literature, then take this class, but be prepared for a lot of reading and long, frequently off-topic conversations.\nWorkload:\nPretty Moderate--three essays (3-5 pages) with a final project (can be writing, a self-portrait, poetry, etc.).  And, of course, you have a good amount of reading (though many people didn't do it).  She allows revisions of all papers except the final.\n"

She even gave an extension on the final exam.  However, she is a HORRIBLE teacher.  If your goal is to learn Spanish, do not take her course.  The entire semester was a blur for me in terms of learning anything.  You are expected to know grammar for the tests, which is a problem because she doesn't teach any.  It is not easy to ask her questions because she get annoyed that you don't already know, if it has to do with grammar.  If you are comfortable with Spanish grammar, she is a great teacher!\n"

First of all, i did absolutly no work for most of it...there is hw assigned on the sylabus that she never ever checks (no point in doing it.) mostly she explors the cultural aspect of the class (poems, plays, movies) (can get very boring) but randomly she'll throw in a grammer lecture which consits of her randomly writing sentences on the board and no one knowing whats going on. all in all an easy class, she's a nice lady but her class is boring..i always did other work in it. this is the class for people who hate spanish, dont want to learn and just want to pass the requiremnt..but the grammer is sometimes hard because she doesnt teach it. dont take this class if u actually like spanish.\nWorkload:\n4 essays (two of which you can rewrite) , 2 midterms, final, final presentation, and she says she includes participation in the grades\n"

And...may I say disorganized...papers scattered about, crazy writing on the blackboard, always behind on the schedule!  Take Rayo if you are looking for a quasi-entertaining person and lots of drama (we were graced with her numerous dramatic speeches and readings)...though if you do take Spanish from her, you will be sacrificing a Spanish education.  \nWorkload:\nreally really manageable...four papers (she takes re-writes after she corrects your mistakes), three tests (she also gives back points for correcting mistakes), a quiz (which was only because we all bombed that section of the test), and a final.  \n"
