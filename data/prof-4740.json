            "review_content": "\nJane Gaines is an interesting and somewhat bizarre character. Half of the time, what she's talking about is so complicated and convoluted that it seems like even she has no clue what she's trying to say, but she definitely knows how to start a stimulating conversation and get you thinking about the way film works. She coins about a dozen new terms or phrases each class using her little \"handwriting\" stylus thing to write on her powerpoints, but you don't really need to know a lot of what she talks about and luckily the TA's grade everything and sometimes even they don't really understand the assignment. The one thing I couldn't stand was that she was often rude to the projectionists, who, admittedly, sometimes were not paying close attention, but there's no excuse to treat them like idiots. I felt bad for the TA's, who were often criticized by Jane, sorry, \"Dr. Gaines\", as they were supposed to call her. Basically, take this class if you really want to change the way you think about documentary or want to make them. If you're not too serious and you're just looking for an easy film class, it might just be confusing and stressful. \nWorkload:\nWeekly readings and discussion questions (no one ever read them before section), 1 hr. discussion section a week, 1 half-page paper, two five page papers, in-class midterm with multiple choice and essays (about an hour and a half of work), take-home final paper. Pretty demanding but not crushing. \n"

            "review_content": "\nJane Gaines is certainly one of the more insane teachers in the film department (she's visiting from Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthough unknown for how long), but her lectures were the best out of any professor in the department I've had so far. She's willing to go there and in terms of being frank about sex and what not. And she was always making off-hand ridiculous comments, which were always gold. She chose an extremely curious line-up of films looking at the studio history, sometimes which felt really didn't fit with the point of her lectures though. They were often great films though. But while Gaines was a fun lecturer, her class workload was demanding for a 3000 level class. She put the midterm the week AFTER spring break, and included many subtle questions about who said what in what reading, most of which I totally blew. Additionally, she had a second midterm right in the middle of our final research papers, which was a take home, of which she wanted to be 10 pages long in responses to questions. Our TA lowered the amount, but it was still very ridiculous. Take Gaines at face value\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor pass/fail the class and skip the unnecessary course load.\nWorkload:\nweekly readings (often over 50 pages), 3 papers\u00e2\u20ac\u201d1 3 pages, 1 5 pages, and 1 10+ pages, two midterms\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth hard and ridiculously placed (see above)\n"
