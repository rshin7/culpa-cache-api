            "review_content": "\nProf. Hui was excellent.  He explained concepts extremely clearly and would repeat himself whenever he saw that the class was having trouble following him, but generally, he is extremely easy to follow.  As with most physics classes, they are easy if the one is comfortable with the mathematics, and this one is no exception.  The problem sets are not very difficult, maybe 1-2 hours per week.  If you are a physics major taking this, expect an easy A.  If not, try to learn the math and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fine.  He does nothing that is beyond Calculus II (u-substitutions, trigonometric substitutions, integration by parts).  The grading is more than generous\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost as if he finds excuses to give you points on tests.  Overall, he is just a very nice guy and extremely accommodating, possibly the best teacher I could have hoped for this class.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets, 1-2 hours each.  1 midterm, easy, allowed one sheet of paper.  1 final, easy, allowed one sheet of paper.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Hui is fantastic.  He is soft-spoken, but he is very clear and his lectures are easy to follow.  He does a great job explaining the math for the most part.  The only thing that is a little annoying was that he would do integration by parts or crazy substitutions in his head.  I found myself wondering a few times wait--how did that just go away, and then you realize that he did a u substitution with cotx or something.  Overall great professor, though.  He is really chill.  \nWorkload:\nThe homework could be rather difficult, especially if you weren't taking the class seriously and doing the work.  The midterm was fair and the final was straightforward.  Know the concepts and you'll be fine.\n"
