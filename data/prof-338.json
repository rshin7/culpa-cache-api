What Fine does not do a good job at is keeping his lectures engaging.  He drowns you to sleep with his monotonous voice and you are ultimately unable to absorb much chemistry. \nThe average student then does not learn much because they are asleep whenever he says anything important.  Several questions on his tests (1-3/20) are directly from lectures and demonstrations.  The others questions are derived almost exactly from the homework questions he gives out.  Average test grades are like 13/20, and he curves a 13/20 to a B or B+! \nIf you learn how to do the homework questions and get a gist of the in class demonstrations you would be satisfied with your grade.  The curve is phenomenal.\nWorkload:\nFour optional problem sets (DO THEM!), weekly recitation quizzes, fair\n"

However, if you are a chem major or you have a genuine interest in the sciences and how things work, I really think you'll like it, aprticularly if you like learning for learning's sake. Fine does talk about some random stuff during his lectures that doesn't show up on tests, and he does throw in random questions that don't seem relevant to what you are studying. But I found that when he started going on about effects of radiation on the body or history of nuclear warfare or einstein's life, thats when I perked up and paid attention. He's the first professor I have found who spends his time teaching students what all this stuff is actually used for, and why its important. Don't think I got some wonderful grade in this class either... I was fine throughout the whole class and somehow bombed the exam and wound up extremely disappointed, but I'm telling you, if you are genuinely interested in chemistry and science, you'll like this class. \nWorkload:\nI'm pissed I didn't study better for the exam... argh darnit.

For those of us who are pre-med and really want to understand the material, he just doesn't care.  He is the perfect professor to weed out the weak, but he tortures those who want to learn in the process.  Overall, one of the worst professors I have ever taken at any institution.

As a premed student who had no choice but to take Fine's Gen Chem section due to scheduling reasons, I was very worried about taking this class due to all the negative reviews.  One thing people often complain about is how Fine is a poor lecturer.  While it is true that he is rather boring (but this is probably true of a lot of chem classes), his lectures are not nearly as nonsensical and off-topic as others make it seem.  He does teach some topics that aren't in the syllabus but they do not require much studying and for those of us who have any real interest in science, they are pretty interesting subjects.  Another thing people often criticize are Prof. Fine's exams.  Overall, the exams are very fair even though there are some poorly written questions.  However, each exam has several extra credit questions so the exam grades turn out pretty well (plus there is a curve).  Basically, I ended this class with an A+ not having done too much work and I learned a great deal of chemistry.  So if you are like me and forced to take Fine's class, it is not the end of the world.  Fine is a kind person and I can't understand why people rate him so terribly.\nWorkload:\nThere are three midterms that are fair.  Weekly quizzes in recitation.  One final exam that is also fair.\n"

Fine is a really nice man and really goes out of his way to make lectures interesting. Believe me - by the end of the semester you'll be so grateful that he does demos - they really wake you up! And they're interesting to watch. His tests are also not too bad. He doesn't put a lot of math-related stuff on the test, and he posts old tests online (I found those really helpful). He usually puts on a couple of questions from old tests and maybe 1 or 2 from lecture notes or the textbook. Overall, its not too bad. But then there are a couple of random questions that he always sticks in that you either guess correctly or incorrectly on. However, if you have good guessing skills, and a good TA, you should do fine.

Fine does an excellent job in explaining the basics of chemical theory and while he may tend to digress from actual chemistry, his random facts of nobel prize winners, etc. gives you time to either go over the notes, think about your other work, or most likely catch a few minutes of in-class sleep. Still, Fine knows his material and is especially clear on certain topics such as quantum theory and hybridization. I know many people who don't attend his lectures, simply based on the fact that they believe they can do equally fine by reading the textbook... this is true; however, his lectures do give hints as to what may be on the upcoming exam, especially at the end when he does demonstrations. The class itself is primarily a theory based class for chemistry - atomic theory, basic chemical calculations, quantum theory, orbitals, structure, etc. If you read the book, do the homework, do the extra problems for practice, and luck out with a good TA (if not, I suggest Kathleen Kristian), you'll be more than prepared.  \nWorkload:\n8 quizzes (drop lowest 3), 3 midterm/exams, final, Homework not collected, but useful for exams and especially quizzes. exams are all multiple choice, some bonus/extra credit.

Just pay attention in lecture and do all the work and you\u00c2\u2019ll do well in the class. \nAfter bombing the first midterm I realized I missed a lot of questions which were related to the lectures and got my act together. If you take notes in class and read the lecture slides you\u00c2\u2019ll be fine. Copy down every single thing he writes on the board no matter how trivial it seems. There were definitely some tricky questions on his exams but most of them were easy, you\u00c2\u2019ll find yourself finishing the test 30mins early and going back to the hard ones to check for mistakes. I ended up with a final average of 97 so don\u00c2\u2019t believe the others who say the tests are hard. All I did differently on the following exams was to concentrate more on my class notes and lecture slides. It also doesn\u00c2\u2019t hurt to redo assigned problems the night before. People who sleep in class do poorly on the test because they miss the easy lecture related questions which is why there are so many bitter reviews. \nIn response to the reviewers who complained about his \u00c2\u201cextra\u00c2\u201d material such as IR radiation, people taking Chemistry Lab first term needed to understand that for the spectroscopy experiment so he was doing us a favor. The Chemistry Lab TA\u00c2\u2019s expect you to learn everything on your own. I am also glad I had Fine because I was well prepared for Physics II Lab while others had no idea what was going on for the photoelectric and radiation labs.\nIf you have a curiosity for science then take Professor Fine.

This is all you really need to know, but for some details:\n1) The lectures are absolutely useless. Fine spends most of class substituting infantile Powerpoint slides for actual teaching. The only things that are ever somewhat worth looking at on those slides are the occasional definition of some experiment or some term that might not be explicitly mentioned in the textbook. \nMany of the slides - and therefore the content of the lectures - consist of cartoons lacking comprehensible explanations or pictures of famous chemists who graduated from Columbia. Obviously, neither of those is in any way helpful to understanding anything relevant to the class. Sometimes pictures are worth a thousand words, but when you stare at a large drawing of a microwave oven with no context and no functional description, that picture is worth absolutely nothing. The lab demonstrations are sometimes interesting but also aren't very helpful.\n2) The textbook and (not required, but helpful) homework is all right. I find the textbook to be decent enough so that Fine's \"lectures\" become irrelevant. The homework and the recitation sections are FAR more educational than class is; if you're interested in chemistry, thoroughly read the book and then ask your TA to clarify or expand on whatever is in there. \n3) The tests are, well, laughable. Not because they're easy, not because they're hard, but because they are nonsensical. Half-or-so of each test is doable, but then there are the obligatory questions with way-too-long introductions that are totally irrelevant to the question. There are also the horribly irritating ones about what color things are when they react with other things. In addition, these questions are always wonderful to see on an exam:\nAnswers:\na) thing 1, thing 1\nb) thing 1, thing 2\nc) thing 2, thing 1\nd) thing 2, thing 2\nBah. But that's life, I suppose.\nThe bottom line is that this class with this professor is simply not good. You're at Columbia; you deserve better. Do yourself a favor and pick a different section.\nOh, and for the record: the one class we had with Professor Turro was unfathomably more intelligible than any of Fine's lectures. So it's not the class; it's Fine. \nWorkload:\nHomework: If you do it all, there's a lot. But it's not graded, and I recommend spending the 75 minutes of allotted class time doing homework instead.\nTests: 8 quizzes (3 dropped), 3 midterms, and a final.

I stupidly disregarded other negative CULPA reviews and thought that the reviewers were just people who got bad grades and had bad attitudes.  I got an A+ (normally a brag, but this is an anonymous review, so give me a break.) but I hated every minute of this class, and I am pissed I had to go through it. Don't make my mistake! Listen to these people! In my review I will try to outline what makes FIne's class so horrible. I will also give tips on how you can succeed in his class in spite of how horrible it is.\nChemistry should be a completely straight-forward science class: text book, lectures that explain the text book, and tests and quizzes on the text book. While this would normally constitue 100% of  any Columbia science class, it constitutes only about 80% of Fine's class. The other 20% is stuff Fine just decides to talk about in lecture-- stupid bullshit that nobody cares about, e.g. lightbulbs, sunscreen, air pollution. Fine usually goes through this extra stuff very quickly in his lectures, only explaining it superficially. Don't try to teach it to yourself later on. His power point slides are useless. USELESS. Believe me. But you can't ignore the extra shit either, because he always asks questions about it on exams. He also made us spend time using this shitty software to try to understand Infra Red light and molecule vibrations.  It was a boring, a complete waste of time, but again, there were questions about the software on the exams. You will probably prefer to study chemistry with someone who doesn't subject you to that kind of bullshit. Chemistry is hard enough as is. \nThe other criticisms of Fine already listed in other reviews are completely accurate. His lectures are disorganized. No one seemed to mention that Fine is soft-spoken and never turns up the microphone. His demos are usually fun to watch, but hard to follow (and again, he WILL ask you questions about them on the midterm, so you have to take detailed notes on the demos and memorize these details for the exams. If you don't get the demos, go see him in office hours, or you're fucked.)\nThe good thing about Fine: he does care about teaching. He will always hold review sessions before the finals. Go to those review sessions. It will really help you anticipate what he will test you on. He will also upload past exams on courseworks. Sometimes they are helpful, sometimes they are misleading. Still, you have to do them to cover your ass.\nSo, if you want to do well in this class, basically you have to be responsible for knowing and understanding anything and everything that Fine mentions. It's a real ballbuster. The reviewer who said that he had to teach himself a lot of the material through Google got it exactly right. I did the same thing. When you have to actually go outside the class materials to learn what Fine is supposedly teaching you, you know you picked the wrong Chem section.\nWorkload:\nWeekly homework takes about 3 hours to do well, but it is not graded. Weekly quizzes in recitation. Three exams, one final. All exams are curved. Many a wasted hour trying to figure out what the hell Fine was talking about in lecture.\n"

He really tries, though - there are a lot of demos, some pretty cool. Every lecture he mentions another Columbia graduate who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry after studying in the very same room he's now teaching in.  You have to learn a ton of information. If you read along in the book you'll be OK - if you don't read or do any of the (optional) homework, you'll be about average. Hope you get a good TA who will re-teach everything every week. That is the only thing that will help you, since you'll fall asleep in lecture. It is really hard to make chemistry interesting, as demonstrated well by Fine.  \nWorkload:\nOptional homework. quizzes every week in recitation (there are 8, drop lowest 3). 3 midterms, final - at the end you drop the lowest out of 6 things - quiz total, midterms, and final (counts for 2). \n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Leonard Fine, where can we start?\nProfessor Fine started the year with an introduction to what we would learn in chemistry and even though CULPA told me he was boring (or that's what I remember CULPA telling me)  I thought the opposite from that first lecture. I said \"Hey, this can't be so bad.\" The second lecture he taught a little bit and had a cool exploding experiment and it seemed ok. The third and fourth lectures, the last two I ever attended, he taught nothing and I fell asleep on that uncozy piece of wood they call a \"desk\". To be correct, Prof. Fine taught stuff yes, but what that stuff is has nothing, and I cannot stress the meaning of NOTHING, to do with the respective chapters in the book. Let's just say that stuff was never mentioned again.\nA lecture is 75 minutes long and could be a very productive and enlightening lecture. 75 minutes are wasted instead if you decide to attend these lectures. I learned more studying on my own while watching TV for five hours than attending all four of those lectures - I was stuck on the same page in the book for those five hours.\nNow, TA sessions do make up for what Fine decided not to teach aka the stuff you actually need to know. You only have 50 minutes a session and meet only once a week. 150 minutes of lectures a week is all crammed into 50 minutes a week of TA sessions thus you will never learn every single thing, and no knowledge will be indepth. Depending on your TA, quizzes may or may not be hard. My TA asked us to know everything and thus 95% of the kids in my class do not have anything close to the 100% quiz average all of the kids with the easier TAs have. This is Fine's fault for not teaching anything.\nThe only homework you do is have quizzes on each chapter in each TA session (quizzes can take 10 to 15 minutes) thus resulting in only 40 minutes of learning time. There are 3 midterms and each works its own way. The first midterm was actually straightforward and I did pretty well in it. The second I didn't study for much and did poorly but 1/2 the questions were trick questions or just not related to anything we learned at all. The third midterm I spent at least 15 hours studying for - all that studying did not pay off because Fine basically said, when giving us that exam, \"You know all that studying you kids have been doing? Throw it all out the window because this test has nothing to do with the material.\" The midterms have NOTHING to do with the practice midterms although that is the ideal way to study. Fine tries to make you study extra stuff on the side and even tries to get you to use his computer program on IR frequencies. Fine asks you to know so much and 95% of what you have to know is self-taught. And the book sucks so self-teaching can be detrimental to your mental health. In fact, I was using Google for pretty much every aspect of chemistry that the book could not explain in even remotely understandable terms.\nIn conclusion, if you want to learn chemistry do not take this class b/c you will be ripping your hair out in frustration and anger and feel things like \"why do I even care to study? I won't do any better anyway\". If you want to do well in chemistry, do not take this class because you won't unless you are the nerdiest of all nerds (no offense to the nerds). My roommate came out of McDermott's final today 1 1/2 hr after it started at 9am - he also told me it started 30minutes late. He hasn't gotten less than 100% on any quiz and he had the freedom to not go to one midterm b/c he knew he'd do well on the final so as to drop his zero. If you can, try to get into McDermott's class or even Turro's who I hear has as easy a class. If you aren't going to learn anything anyway, you might as well do well in the class. Fine is not your answer and some day he will be replaced by someone who knows what the hell it means to be able to teach and to be fair when assigning chapters to study for midterms/finals.\nWorkload:\n3 Midterms each 20%, 8 Quizzes (drop 3 lowest automatically), and a Final (40%) of grade...you can drop either a midterm or half the Final grade. These are much harder than you'd like due to Fine liking to add extra material to your study time when neither he nor your TA even talked about that stuff.\n"

And from what i hear the other teachers are 10 times easier but Fine writes the Final so at least youll have a good idea what that will be like.  Basically if you want to learn anything then stick to your textbook.  One good point is that he will always try to give you the highest grade possible- for example we had a 25 question test where 5 of the questions didn't count but if you got all 5 questions right then he gave you the higher percentage grade.  \nWorkload:\n8 Quizzes in section (drop 3), 3 midterms (Drop 1)-ridiculously hard, Extra-Credit Paper, Final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAfter the first lecture, with his cool little movie about Havemeyer and little demos with fire, I thought Prof. Fine would be an awesome professor, but by the second lecture, I realized I was wrong. First, his lectures make no sense and I really wonder if he is still teaching because the Chemistry department pities him. Also, he would ramble on and on about the fricking nobel prize, politics or whatever else was on his mind for 20 minutes in lecture.  That will not help me on the MCAT, so please Prof Fine, do your job and teach Chemistry. And finally, he is arrogant and he does not respect his students and really does not care about them at all. \nThe exams were torture because he would ask questions about random things he said in lecture, he would throw material on the exam we were not required to know and his questions were poorly phrased, with plenty of run on sentences and more ramblings. Expect questions like \"well if I throw some sugar and salt in the air and they land in a bowl, tell me the percent weight of Cl-?\"  I was actually able to get an A but I didn't see that grade because Fine a) calculated everyone's grades wrong and b) he normalized our means with the means of Prof. Turro and Ann McDerment, who gave their classes exams that were insanely easy and straightforward. \nUnfortunately, being a post bacc I had to take this class, but just to give everyone a head's up, Columbia's teaching of Gen Chem is horrible and the faculty is very inept. I learned more when I took GChem at UChicago because I actually had to learn how to use the Schrodienger Equation, my profs didn't ramble about bullshit, it was all problem based, and we had exams that were not multiple choice. My final words of wisdom, go to lecture even though sitting through one is a bitch and a half, outline the chapters and do every single problem you can get your hands on. Otherwise, take this lecture with Turro or McDerment and stay away from Fine!\nWorkload:\n3 exams, one paper, 8 quizzes and one final, not bad but the class is mostly independent study. I had to not only outline the chapters of the textbook but had to make sense of his stupid powerpoint slides. \n"

Although, I agree with some of the negative comments posted.  Yes, he does talk about stuff that is not on the exam (e.g. history of 309 Havemeyer) but it makes the class interesting.  Yes, he is political to some degree.  But all of his \u00c2\u201coff topic\u00c2\u201d stuff throughout the semester doesn\u00c2\u2019t even add up to half a lecture.  He covers the material very well.  His powerpoints are a little bit disorganized, but he tries to give them out before lecture so you can take notes on them \u00c2\u2013 unlike many other Profs.  When he works out problems, he works them out on the blackboard \u00c2\u2013 which I think is much better than trying to follow equations through powerpoint slides.\nHe is very approachable during office hours and holds his own review sessions before the exam.  Go to those review sessions - he basically goes over everything you need to know.  Sometimes, he even gives away exam questions!   If you show up to lecture, you will be rewarded.  There are several questions on each exam that you will know just by being in lecture or seeing the demos.\nThe extra problem sets that he posts are ball busters, but he will help you solve them -  if you ask.  The TA's will also help you solve them - if you ask.  Yes, they are hard, but they really test your understanding of the material.  The exam questions are nowhere near as hard.\nThe class was fun and informative.  Professor Fine is definitely not condescending and aloof.  He responds to the mid-term survey that you fill out, he goes over it in class and addresses the suggestions and comments that students make.  He wants to get to know his students but you need to take the initiative too \u00c2\u2013 he has over 300 students between the 2 sections.  He invited students to sign up to have dinner with him at faculty house.  I believe ~ 30 students signed up and he took them to dinner in groups of  10.  How many \"aloof and unapproachable\" Profs at Columbia do that?\n\nWorkload:\n3 mid-terms (19% if you do the 4% assignment, 20% each if you don't do the 4% assignment) and a final (counts as 2 exams) - drop one midterm or half of the final.  4% optional assignment (its an easy way to pick up points \u00c2\u2013 if you hate the book selection, you can propose your own writeup for 4%)  bonus points for filling out surveys.  5 out of 10 recitation quizes count for 20% (one exam), the workload is not bad - like what someone else said:  30% of the class got A's and 50% got B's - that's not bad for G-Chem \n"

I'm writing this because I think that if you're looking for a really valuable supplement to your education with the science requirement, this could be a good choice.  You learn a lot across the board of science in a colorful and interesting way.  One of the goals of the course is to learn the basic language of chemistry and how to think critically about science in current events, an observation that seems to have escaped these other few reviewers of this class, and which obviously upset them.  (The review comment here that implied Prof. Fine was pushing a former president totally misrepresents the importance of learning how to discriminate about what politicians and journalists say about science - whether it is true or not, or feasible, etc.)  There are examples of how the science developed (past is prologue) as well as current topical considerations, such as pollution and the environment.\nSince the class sessions can contain about 600 students a year, the few complaints below really are vastly outnumbered by the students who have not complained.\nBoth Professors Fine and Valentini are very experienced, and workload and teaching is so well organized.  The professors are approachable and TAs and general assistance are good for help with problems also.  The way the course is set up, you accumulate points towards your final grade from the monthly exams, essay, Recitation quizzes and then final, so it is possible to get a good grade if you do well on most of the course and can afford to mess up once without great penalty.\nThe studies can be challenging, but if you start determined to keep up with the course, studying regularly, you will learn a lot about the world and exercise your mind/gain some good thinking skills along the way.  But if you're not up to working at it, you won't be able to do things at the last minute, so don't put yourself through the strain.  In this class you really have to stop and think about what is going on.  Profs. Fine and Valentini are outstanding lecturers and teachers - they work hard to provide color and interest to chemistry.  I think this situation is well worth taking advantage of, and  worth the effort.  \n(Good for everyone, and a plus, I would think, for someone planning to work in decision-making fields like an economist or administrator.)\nWorkload:\nStudy is lecture based, and is roughly equivalent to one text chapter per week; No graded homework, but homework problems are assigned or recommended for study and exam prep.

The teachers after him aren't quite so bad.\nWorkload:\nHis worksheets of additional problems are quite different from the questions at the end of the book, so make sure you do them because they'll give you a better chance on the test.\n"

The lectures were at times interesting, but we were prevented from any sort of enjoyment or sense of wonder by the exams, which in no way encouraged any love of the material or of the science of chemistry in general. WHAT IS THE DAMN POINT OF GIVING EXAMS WHERE THE ONLY GOAL IS TO MAKE THE STUDENT FEEL AS THOUGH HE/SHE IS AN IDIOT? I asked myself that question every time I left the exam hall. It is a real shame that professor Fine is permitted to continue his bullying year in and year out-perhaps students are merely happy to escape his class, and leave the burning building without ever looking back. I wish that someone would finally LISTEN to what people say about him. He may be a nice guy outside of class, but it is clear to me that he does not teach to be able to interact with motivated young people. He looks to scare them. What is the point? Why do we pay all this money to be treated in such a way? If he is so intent on giving difficult tests, let him teach uppper level classes, where the students are accustomed to such rough treatment. Why should he be the one to welcome students to the department? Is it really a good idea to introduce pre-med, pre-engineering, and other students to such an important body of material with a punch in the stomach delivered by a grinning Leonard Fine? It is my earnest hope that Prof. Fine will change his ways next year. I know that I am deluding myself. Therefore it is my hope that the department will wisen up and use other teachers next year. I can think of a few individuals who would do a better job, and care more about their students. Saddam Hussein comes to mind...\n"

He knows chemistry, but his teaching is not as stellar. For the majority of the time, he rambles on and on about submarines, dye, space ships, and anything else that seems to have nothing to do with learning chemistry. He goes thru his slides so fast that trying to takes notes is really hard. and if you do go to lecture (which not many do) make sure you take notes on his demonstrations and the way that they work.... He loves to test on them. in general, not bad but can be very boring at times.\nWorkload:\n5 out of 7 quizzes in recitation, 3 exams, chemwrite, and Final.\n"

After the first midterm, you would have the impulse to rip his b**** off and kick his a**! I don't really know why he's a professor because he never teaches anything! What you do is read the chapters by yourself, but you will never understand the book because it's like written in German! I didn't even know why I wasted money buying that sh*t! Chemwrite is bullsh*t! You never have to buy the book, just bs on your paper! The best thing to do after taking his exams is to go to gym and scream out his name! (don't forget to add the f word in front of it though...!) I am sure you will be able to do a hundred pounds more! I am sorry for the freshmen in SEAS (including myself)...\nWorkload:\nWorkload? NONE (besides the fricking chemwrite)... just gotta study for the fricking finals that will rape u anally!\n"
