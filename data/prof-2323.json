            "review_content": "\nAlthough Prof Shukla is pretty nice, her lectures were rambling and oftentimes repetitive. Okay fine, mostly it was painfully boring. She liked to throw around schnazzy anthro-catchphrases  like \"transnationalism\" and \"cultural moments\" etc. and her monotonous lecturing style was frustrating to say the least.  Luckily lectures were only once a week; the other class time was for discussions, which were decent or bad depending on the other people in your group.  One-on-one, she's pretty nice, but i got the feeling (at her office hours) that her mind was always wandering.  Shukla also seems quite frazzled. She never commented on our reading responses which rather bothered me because I didn't know until the midterm how I was doing in the class. \nthe readings in the first half of the semester  consisted of interesting fiction and plays like work from Eric Liu, Joy Kogawa and Jhumpa Lahiri, but the latter half of the syllabus was chock full of really boring theory and ethnographies. \nthere were also great films screened as part of the class but you do have to take time out to watch them yourself. All in all, not a bad professor and a decent class, but the readings did more for me than the lectures ever did.\nWorkload:\na LOT of reading--expect one 200 page book a week, plus at least 5 reading responses due 9am before each wednesday, one take home midterm (6 pages), and one 7-9 page research paper as a final project. \n"
