She opened my eyes to so many new authors, as well as really expanded my knowledge on craft and style.  For avid readers this class is a dream: you read a short amount of fiction every weak and then get to discuss it.  Professor D'Erasmo is really fun, too.  Our class had a great dialog and she set a very enjoyable tone.\nWorkload:\nWeekly reading of either short stories or first chapters of novels, 5 writing exercises.\n"
