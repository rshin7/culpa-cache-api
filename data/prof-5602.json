But you probably are more concerned about the fact that he's a fair professor, so if you're not too familiar with the world of music, you should be ok. Plus, he gave out a study guide for the midterm and final (which were basically lists of everything that would be on the tests) and held review sessions for each. If you study for the tests for a few hours and make sure you have all the listening down, you should be fine. More importantly, his class is super interesting, and you'll learn a lot, If you're put into his section, stay there!\nWorkload:\nListening and a super short comment posted on the blog about it, midterm, final (both very fair), two concert reports (which he offers to read in advance and if you give him enough time)\n"
