            "review_content": "\nHee-Jin was an excellent instructor for ALP 9; she did an excellent job explaining topics and grammar with the use of analogies. I think for someone who needs to improve their English before entering University Writing (UW), she will be a great resource; however, she lacks time management skills in a way that we were continually receiving our feedbacks and a grades later than promised. Besides, she made few statements regarding her availability or extra steps in our development that she promised and never delivered. I think Her-Jin needs to use a technique under-promise and over-deliver; that will work best for Columbia student. \nAnother aspect where she felt short is that she asked us to write an essay from the standpoint that she wanted us to write; I believe that everyone should have their own opinion and they should develop there own ideas instead of writing by cliche. I understand that her approach is the best way to learn how to write a specific type of essay, but in the UW we will be defending our points of view and ALP 9 could of be a good platform to develop writer's voice.  \nI would rate Her-Jin 8 out of 10, and I would recommend her class to a close friend or family member.\nOverall, she was a big help in my development; I have learned a lot since the beginning of the semester. Now, I feel confident about entering UW and rocking it.\nWorkload:\nSimilar workload like other ALP 9, \n3 essays take home ( 3 drafts each ) in total 9 drafts\n3 in-class writing\nWeekly HW 5-7 hours, you might do it faster; personally I write essays very slow. \n"
