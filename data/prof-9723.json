            "review_content": "\nAwesome LitHum Professor, also a loveable professor who probably has no flaws whatsoever. Gives 1 quiz for each book, except for those that are just pure poetry. During class discussion, does not require anyone to talk although this is at least 5-15% of your grade. Discussions are very insightful and he tries to find creative ways to make the texts interesting. Get use to \"What's going on?\"\nWorkload:\nGenerally, 3 essays a semester, may give two. (2 page, then 4 page, then 6 page essay)\nRead the LitHum textbooks although for the Odyssey and the Iliad he spends an additional day on the texts.\nMidterm, which is in the same format as the Final, which is given by the Core offices.\n"

            "review_content": "\nIf you have Humberto for Lit-Hum, you just won the lottery.\nHumberto is absolutely brilliant. He is a master at instigating meaningful, provocative class discussion, and his insight into the texts is fantastic and life-changing. Generally, class begins with either a reading quiz (which everyone typically fails, but it doesn't really impact your grade) or a passage/scene from the reading. From there class rockets off into scintillating debates on passages Humberto selects for us to close-read. Humberto will oftentimes mix up class agendas; several times he asked each person to prepare a 5 minute speech in the spirit of the Symposium or other, which we would then share with the class. Class time was always spent valuably, and I enjoyed every minute (seriously, every minute) of it this year.\nAs if that wasn't enough for you, Humberto is also a genuine, sweet, and lovely human being. One thing I particularly loved is how we would read the texts through a very human lens. It was okay to not understand something, or to voice a strong opinion about one of the characters, or to simply say you loved how a certain scene made you feel. Humberto makes the literature fun and personally engaging, and his kindness and genuine compassion for his students creates a classroom environment that feels like home. \nI honestly can't say enough wonderful things about Humberto. If you have him, you will have the best experience ever. \n\nWorkload:\nWell, it's Lit-Hum, but Humberto makes it pretty easy. He is an extremely generous grader (he really wants you to do well!) but don't take advantage of this. Humberto is too good to be treated as somebody who will give you an easy A. He wants to make Lit-Hum enjoyable for you, so do your part!\n"

He really cares about the students. He is accommodating and wants you to do your best. Recommend to any and all first years.\nWorkload:\n3 essays, midterm, final\nEssays are straightforward. Put a good effort and you'll get a good grade. Talking to him before hand outside of class helps\nExams have quote ids which are challenging but fair\nAll in all, you should walk away with a solid grade if you put in the effort\n"

            "review_content": "\nI miss Humberto now that I am taking CC with somebody that is not Humberto. What I mean to say is that I didn't truly realize how good of a deal I had until I was faced with the reality of taking a class with a vaguely clinical, stilted professor. As others have said, Humberto is really one of the nicest, best people you could take Lit Hum with.\nThat being said, you run the risk of missing out on some incredible insights if you can't maintain your own focus because the classroom he runs is not under draconian rule and you won't be forced to participate. If you don't pay attention, its not like your grade's going to die. Its more like the palpable disappointment will rip your heart right out of your chest. \nWorkload:\nStandard. \n1 quiz per work (this may get dropped if the whole class performs poorly)\n3 essays of neither great difficulty nor length\nmidterm and final\n"

            "review_content": "\nHumberto is easily the best professor I've had at Columbia thus far. And it's not even close. \nRight off the bat, he is the most humble, down-to-earth (to the point of hilarious self-depreciation sometimes), and genuine professor I've known. He has not illusions of grandeur\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201che sees himself as just another member of the class, one who incidentally gets to grade the papers and offer feedback.\nHe loves these books, and he shows it. Every once in a while, towards the end of class, he'll just start waxing poetic about the meaning of life and how a particular book, passage, or idea helped him think about this. One of these speeches resulted in a full-blown standing ovation\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201che's that good. \nHe's an easy grader, mostly because he doesn't care about the grades. And if you meet with him before handing in a paper, he will offer concrete advice on how to improve (read: get a better grade on) your paper.\nIf you landed Humberto, consider yourself lucky. He's not just a great professor; he's just a damn good guy to be around and to learn from.\nWorkload:\nstandard lithum coursework. 3 papers. midterm. final. weekly quiz (which i don't think really matters)\n"

The guy is brilliant- knows 5 or 6 languages--including Spanish, Italian, French, and German--which is helpful when discussing translated literature. I learned so much and looked forward to going to class.\nOverall, he's just a really nice guy. He is very open to new suggestions and ideas and expresses his honest opinion, sometimes providing good constructive criticism. He has given extensions for papers to the whole class and dropped quizzes on which we all did poorly. Great sense of humor as well. \nI would recommend him to anyone trying to switch \np.s.- we discussed Game of Thrones for our last class of the year \nWorkload:\n1 quote quiz per book- 10 points each (~10%) \n3 or 4 papers per semester \n1 Midterm \n1 Final \n-not too bad overall\n"
