            "review_content": "\nEmily is very smart and knows her stuff. She will work you very hard and can be very intimidating. I don't think she knows she's intimidating, but when she asks you a question, she expects an answer, and I always felt a little unsure of myself because it's impossible to know the material better than she does. Not everyone in the class felt intimidated, but I know it was a common theme. She's a hard grader (didn't get my final grade back yet, but reading almost all the material and putting in an honest effort, based off the feedback I've gotten so far, I expect to be borderline B+/A-). That being said, I do feel like she pushed us so that I got a lot out of the class. If you are really interested in CC, she's a good teacher. If not, just know it's not an easy A.\nWorkload:\nModerate to heavy. She cuts down reading sometimes if she feels some works need more discussion. \n6 required online responses (casual, but she reads them all) per semester (each on different works)\n1 two-page summary on one of the works (your choice, first come first served)\n1 short essay (4-6 pages)\n1 long essay (8-10 pages)\nMidterm (all IDs -- short and long/response style) -- very difficult -- she needed to curve it\nFinal -- IDs same style as midterm, but fewer and 2 essays\n"
