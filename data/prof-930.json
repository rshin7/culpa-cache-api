Taylor is a terrible lecturer, her test are ridiculously hard and requires a lot of useless memorization, and she is very unaccommodating to any requests. Her lectures are just reading off of old reused power points, and are extremely boring, especially being at night class. Although you can drop the lowest test, they are all unfairly graded because she makes the rubric overly specific so that partial points are hard to come by. She requires you to remember hundreds of terms that serve no purpose other than to just to make your life more difficult. She is very unapproachable and makes any special requests seem like the end of the world. She tries to make jokes in class that aren't funny. This is basically an extended, more boring, more annoying version of the neuroscience section of FroSci.\nWorkload:\n3 midterms\n1 final\n1 essay\n17 online quizzes\n"

I repeat this is the easiest and most interesting class I have every taken at Columbia....... PAUSE NOTTTTTTT..... This class absolutely sucks. Kathleen may be the most cold hearted, un-funny, and pretentious teacher (I don't even want to call her a professor because it would be a shame to all of the other professors in the world) I have ever met in my life. The lectures could not be more boring.... absolutely brutal. This class was at 7:10pm and I tell you what, I think I learn more useful information watching grass grow or paint dry than I do in this class. The lecture are basically her reading of a powerpoint and the learning aspect is pretty much you just learning vocab words along with memorizing different regions of the brain. Midterms are useless, she overloads information to where it half way drives you crazy. She has way too many strict guidelines and does not accommodate to any student needs. \nWorkload:\n4 exams 25% each, lowest is dropped\n25 % other which includes quizzes, an essay, and arguable the biggest waste of time in 2 experiments that you will have.\n"

Prof Taylor's organizational skills may be a nightmare and a half, but if you do your part as a student--review your notes, ask questions, and go to office hours, everything comes together. Lean on the TAs (especially Jeremy) because they know that Prof. Taylor is a tornado and that her slides often make little sense.\nAgain the class is rewarding. I recommend starting to answer study questions at least 2 weeks before the exam that way you have time to go to office hours before the mad dash the day before the exam. Don't bother memorizing anything she teaches the day before an exam. Since you have choices on each test as to which questions you answer, focus on 80% of the material and skip the stuff you learn the week of the test. You don't have to answer it anyway.\nWith the online quizzes, just commit to sitting in front of a computer randomly clicking for an hour until you get a 10/10. They really help your grade, and they're kind of like a computer game. Don't bother looking for answers in the text ... which by the way was a waste of money!\nFor entertainment during the 8:40 lectures (which are absolutely mandatory if you want to do well. Write down every last word that woman says, she will expect you to know it, and the slides are not helpful) keep a tally of each time she mentions her ex-husband. It comes to at least 2x per class. \nAgain the class really gives you a good handle on the basics of neuroscience. I learned a lot, got a lot out of the course, but also put a lot in. It was a valuable experience!\nWorkload:\n15% online quizzes\n5% Research review paper\n5% Neuroscience Seminar Summary \n75% Your Top 3 Exams (3 Midterms, one Final.

In other words, you might not want to take this class, or any for that matter, with Professor Taylor. Here's why:\n1. She is not a good lecturer -- Taylor makes rather slapdash, arbitrary powerpoints and unenthusiastically slogs through them in class. You get the feeling that she made them years ago and quickly scrolls through them the night before the lecture to refresh herself. This makes for boring and uninspired lectures. \n2. She is not well organized -- Unlike some professors who graciously post their powerpoints before class, allowing students to take notes right on it, Taylor often didn't upload hers until weeks after the lecture. She's also not so great about the weekly quizzes students are required to take. A couple times this semester she sent emails explaining that she had goofed on making the quiz and that now the deadline has been changed, or that we don't have to take one this week, blah blah. No one's perfect and these things aren't really a big deal, but it is a bit frustrating/distracting when the course is so inconsistent.\n3. She doesn't really care -- Well, this explains it all. Taylor is not very invested in her courses or students. As a result, her powerpoints, course, tests are poorly designed; talking to her after class or going to her office hours (if she hasn't canceled them) is an uncomfortable experience; she doesn't try to find the answer to a student's question if she doesn't know it at first (she'll just say \"as far as I'm aware\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" or outright \"I don't know\" and leave it at that); et cetera. \nHaving said all that, this class is not very difficult. If you keep up on the weekly quizzes, do the writing assignment systematically and on time, and actually learn the material (rather than learning Taylor's powerpoints) you will do fine. So, if you are the type of person who intrinsically enjoys the subject matter, and who is able to not let all of the above crumminess affect you, then you should maybe just go ahead and take this class and get the credit. BUT, if you're the type of person for whom it is difficult to keep separate a very cool subject and its totally meh and annoying professor, maybe don't take this class. Your interest in the class will likely wane as your frustration with Taylor grows, and it will probably be difficult to do well. \nOverall, this course with Taylor kinda stinks. Also, the below review is accurate, I would say.\nWorkload:\n10-questions-in-10-minutes weekly quizzes on CourseWorks that are easy to forget about. 3 midterms & 1 final, the lowest of which is dropped. Straightforward writing assignment. The final is multiple choice and significantly easier than the midterms.\n"

It was very straightforward, the readings aligned with what was being taught in lecture, and the midterms and final were made up of the core material covered by the class. Another plus of the class is that there wasn't a discussion section. And at the end of the day, I actually learned quite a bit about psych, about stuff that's generally just good to know for life, I think.\nTaylor was, all in all, a pretty good lecturer. She generally kept things interesting by interspersing some humor into what could have been really dry material, and by every once in a while engaging the class in little exercises/experiments to demonstrate psychology concepts she was talking about. She also did everything necessary for students (who keep up with things reasonably) to succeed, from posting lecture slides online to organizing TA-led review sessions before midterms and the final.\nTaylor was not, however, very responsive at office hours; after going once, I was not tempted to ever go back. I asked her one question (not actually regarding the core course material but stemming from it) that she seemed to think was completely basic, and she proceeded to look at me like I was stupid and ask me what exactly I wanted her to say.\nBut on the whole, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you really need to go to office hours in order to succeed in the class. Just stay reasonably on top of the course material and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fine.\nI would recommend this class if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a humanities major looking to get your science requirement done, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably one of the most straightforward science classes you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come across at Columbia.\n\nWorkload:\n3 midterms\n1 final (optional)\n1 written review of a scientific article\n"

Having taken Science of Psych and Bio (kind of unusual, I know), there wasn't much new material and she tried really hard to be funny when explaining the material and it just wasn't. \nDon't bother purchasing the ridiculously priced book because it added nothing new and you won't open it. I actually tried reading it for the first test but realized that even though she threatens everything in the text will be covered, nothing except her class lecture info is on the exams. \nAlso, she's extremely difficult to get in touch with. She tells you to email her about any quiz concerns but never responds. I even asked her in class and she told me she'd get to my email but didn't until I prompted her again during reading week, almost a month later. Also one of the TAs messed up slightly on the exam grading and didn't give full points back until I persisted about it for a while which was frustrating because it wasn't any student's fault. \nFinally, to clear up any misconceptions that we commonly have with all these types of poor reviews on CULPA, I'm not complaining because I did poorly in the class--it's not too difficult to get an A, but honestly this class is so frustrating and probably boring at best. Not sure what her Science of Psych course is like, but if her attitude/teaching style is the same as for this course, I'd recommend Lindemann a thousand times over her. \n\nWorkload:\nThree tests plus final, final is optional if you don't skip any of the first three tests.

Professor Taylor has little to add. The function of the course is dubious - how does this course differ than the others offered?\nUnfortunately Professor Taylor relies on trite explanations and only requires memorization out of her students. The class doesn't require any thought - just a humongous number of flashcards. I for one am not sure that is the purpose of a college education.\nMoreover Professor Taylor is downright rude to students. When I requested an accommodation for the final exam (it would fall during a Jewish holiday) during the first week of the semester as the registrar required Prof. Taylor was just upset that she would have to construct an additional exam. Rather than being understanding she failed to live up to the university standard despite being prodded for months. Only when I had an administrator reach out to the registrar directly was there any response. While I understand the inconvenience in having to accommodate an exception in a large lecture class, Prof. Taylor was incredibly disagreeable to work with.\n\nWorkload:\nWeekly quizzes online. Three exams and an optional final. You are required to take all the exams, if you are satisfied with your grades you are not required to take the final. If you take the final, the lowest of your four grades will be dropped. There is also a short written assignment (around two pages).\nAs mentioned above I do not believe in the value of examinations that solely require rote memorization. There was little to no intellectual stimulation in the class.\nThe writing assignment (translating a journal article into a popular piece) was more stimulating - but as Professor Taylor herself put it - not a big deal. It was very much a late high school assignment.\n\n"

The lecture slides are uploaded after the class with \"Study Questions\" added, and those questions are what she bases the exams off of.\nTaylor is very no-nonsense, but she manages to enforce her rules in a respectful manner. I never found her to be rude or cocky, but then again I can handle tough professors better than most. THAT being said, I wouldn't even consider her tough, just focused.\nThere's an emphasis on the fact that it's an intro course with lots of different topics to cover, meaning if you ask to go in-depth on something, Taylor will likely divert your question in order to save class time, but will recommend coming to office hours to get it explained if you're interested.\nI went to office hours for 2 of the TAs and constantly emailed one, and they were more than happy to help. The only issue was that since they study different subject areas, one would be more knowledgeable about a certain topic than another, but they would ALWAYS direct you to the correct TA to ask. I had a wonderful experience with the TAs.\nThe reading helps - in fact, the book is pretty funny and quite helpful, and I would recommend doing the reading - but she in no way enforces it unless she did not have time to cover some material due to extenuating circumstances.\n\nWorkload:\n3 semester exams + optional cumulative final (you can take all 4 and your lowest grade is dropped)\nSuper-easy written assignment that you have 2 months to complete\n3 hrs of research participation\nWe had an extra-credit online quiz that counted towards our first exam, but she might not keep this\n"

Love to read the reviews from the whiners (boo hoo, why can't I get an A without studying?) but any big lecture course is gonna have those.  Note to whiners:  You're at Columbia.  Do the work.

It takes a fair amount of time to answer those questions and memorized the crapload of details that come with every intro course (and science courses in general) but if don't leave it to the night before the midterm, you'll be fine.  I got an A without having to take the final.  Don't know what the other review was whining about with office hours - Taylor is there before lecture, and for an hour or two in the afternoon once a week (I forget which day).  \nShort version:  If you're willing to work in a class, take Taylor's Science of Psych.

Maybe it's based on who you are, but I personally did not find her to be \"disrespectful\" or rude. I would definitely say that she's sassy and rough around the edges, but not so much that I felt personally disliked. Many of her \"rude\" comments are intended to be funny, though it might not be your kind of humor.\nLectures: they were worth attending, if at least for some of the interesting or entertaining stories and videos. Generally they aligned well with what was asked on exams, though the fact that the majority of the class surfs the internet at some point during class time should indicate that not every detail will be relevant later.\nTextbook readings: some people never opened it, others did many or most of the readings. The book was actually quite funny and had some really interesting sections that we didn't talk about much in class. Generally speaking, it's extremely useful if you find yourself confused about lecture material (or missed a class).\nExams: generally pretty fair. From time to time there would be questions with tricky wording or focused on topics we hadn't covered as well, but Taylor and the TAs were helpful during exam periods if something weren't clear. The study questions she includes at the end of each Powerpoint is surefire the best way to study -- they indicate what the exam will focus on and are by themselves a great test prep technique. The questions that go along with textbook chapters can be useful if you find yourself with extra test prep time (or want to really make the most of the reading) but aren't necessary.\nI'd say if you're looking for a very cuddly class experience, don't take this class.

Having just finished Science of Psych with Taylor, I'd like to highlight a different side of the course.\nWhile her personality may indeed be an issue at times (she gives death stares to people who walk in late), the class itself is not awful. Her lectures are usually interesting and she presents information clearly. She often throws in a video or a demonstration to change things up. Easily the best aspect of her class is the fact that she provides us with study questions for each lecture, which are (for the most part) limited to what she actually teaches us. These study questions cover 98% of the material that shows up on exams and virtually eliminate the need for reading the textbook. Lots of people never crack the textbook open at all, making the course less of a time-suck.\nAs for the exams themselves, they really stick to what she talked about in class. Some of the questions can be tricky and unclear, but it honestly isn't too ridiculous to get A's on all of the exams if you've put in some time answering all the study questions and making sure you actually remember the basics of your answers. Getting an A+ in the course, which requires a 98+ on EVERY exam, is virtually impossible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even if you know 100% of the material, odds are you'll screw up a bizarre question or two that you misinterpret.\nPersonally, I never had to deal with the TA's or Professor Taylor on an individual basis, but at least the TA's seemed nice enough. I ended up with an A in the class (any questions I had I just googled to get the answer) and I put in a good amount of time studying before each exam, but I rarely read the textbook (pretty much just used her lecture slides and study questions).\nIf you're the type of person who doesn't like reading the textbook and prefers to attend (and pay attention to) lectures, this is probably the class for you. I assume it requires a similar amount of memorization as Lindemann's class.\nWorkload:\n3 Midterms; 6 credits (3 hours) of psychology research participation (lots of the experiments don't even take as long as they say they will... one of the 30 minute experiments I signed up for took 2 minutes); 1 written assignment critiquing a popular press article about how it explains a pee-reviewed scientific journal article; 1 Final.\nSOMETHING REALLY NICE ABOUT THIS CLASS: You can drop one exam. The exam you drop CAN BE THE FINAL. If you are content with your midterm grades (as I was), you simply don't have to take the final at all, which made my life MUCH easier during finals time. Not sure what Lindemann does, but this might be reason enough for you to take this course if you know you are going to be super busy around finals time with other classes.\n"

For instance, the lowest grade on the first exam was an 18% and the highest was like an 108% percent (with the extra credit offered only for that exam). I ending up doing well, but my personal experience with the professor and TAs was terrible, particularly as the semester progressed. \nAt first, I found Professor Taylor to be strict and no-nonsense, but a competent professor. She delivered organized lectures and kept the class informed about assignments and class requirements with her announcements at the beginning of every class. Taylor was also very understanding with the first assignment: a 5 point short answer question modeled after the exam short answers, to be submitted via Courseworks. Half the class had technical difficulties or was unclear about the deadline. She still gave full credit for late submissions, which was very nice of her. \nHowever, as the semester progressed, I found the professor to be exceedingly rude and condescending. Once, a public safety officer walked in and waited for Professor Taylor to acknowledge her so that she could alert her to a potential safety concern in the building. The Professor arrogantly told her off for disrupting the lecture. Taylor also held office hours at 8 AM. I don't understand why ... she usually came late and appeared lethargic and unwilling to listen to students' questions. It was moments like these that made me loathe Taylor as a person.\nI also didn't like the fact that her lectures often contradicted the textbook. In fact, people would often point out specific inconsistencies during the TA-led review sessions, and the TAs would openly say that the professor had been wrong.\nFinally, the final exam was hastily written, as it was riddled with spelling errors. Even though this is an introductory course, the professor, lectures and TAs all failed to meet the standards I have come to expect from a Columbia course. I would suggest that you avoid Taylor for Science of Psychology. \nWorkload:\n3 midterm exams - each is 30% of the grade\n3 hours of participating in psych experiments on campus (5%)\nResearch critique (5%)\nOptional final exam - you can drop the lowest midterm grade and count the final instead\n"

            "review_content": "\nI took Behavioral Neuroscience with Professor Taylor last spring and absolutely LOVED the course! As a neuroscience major and someone who had only taken Science of Psych at the time and is currently taking Neurobio, I think Taylor's course was the BEST intermediate psych elective to bridge the difference between pure psychology and higher level biology course. \nIt was much more detailed than descriptive psychology concepts I learned from intro courses. This is where I got my first taste of GPCR's, cAMP and IP3 pathways. Futhermore, I got in depth explanation about different neurotransmitters and how they are imitated or hindered by drug use. But no need to get intimidated if this doesn't sound familiar because the nitty-gritty detailed stuff was never really tested. I often studied with non-science majors who found Taylor's lectures and the textbook to be equally as fascinating and performed really well on exams too. Like people have mentioned in other reviews, Taylor's exams are VERY straight-forward. Just attend lecture because she drops major hints about questions that she will ask. Graders are very lenient on partial credit too. \nAbout Professor Taylor overall, she is very organized, straightforward, and the best dry humor. Her sarcasm may not be everyone's stlye, but she lectures in such an interesting and anecdotal way so that it's memorable! She's also very good about performing in-class demonstrations, showing videos clips, and is even offering students the opportunity to dissect a real sheep's brain!! What more could you ask for?\nWorkload:\n3 exams + 1 final all worth the same points, with one section that can be dropped. Should attend lecture for test hints and in-class demonstrations. Textbook reading should be supplementary, but sometimes necessary to reinforce lectures. \n"

Her lectures are interesting and straightforward, and she has funny demonstrations and videos that really illustrate her points (she sometimes asks about the demonstrations or you can reference them on exams too, and they're pretty easy to remember). \nHer exams are really straightforward -- three 'midterms', one final, you can drop your lowest grade so if you do well on the midterms you don't have to take the final. The midterms are some fill in the blank (no word bank), matching, and then usually three sets of two essays each, and you choose one to do (for a total of three essays). The final is all multiple choice, cumulative. GO TO CLASS! The exams are based entirely off the lectures, you do not need to open the book at all (except for 'supplementary' 'enriching' info), and if you study from your notes you'll be fine. I studied the few days before each exam and got As. \nTaylor knows a lot about the subject and she's upfront about things she doesn't know. There are Q&A; sessions held by the TAs before each exam, they are helpful even if you don't have questions prepared because others do, but you don't have to go to them by any means (I went to some but not others and it seemed OK either way). The TAs have office hours and so does she, but I've never been to them. They were very helpful over email about questions, though.\nThis class is a great intro psych class. A lot of interesting things are covered like decision-making and emotions, and after you get a better sense of what psych fields specifically you're interested. I'm not a psych major, I was just curious about it and fulfilling a science requirement, I feel like I've learned a lot about psych although I'm not sure I'll take more classes in the field. I'm really glad I took the class though, for someone not interested in pursuing it at all and unsure at the beginning of the semester whether I wanted to stay in it, I would say it's one of my favorite classes of the semester.\nWorkload:\nPretty low coursework, nothing to do all semester except do experiments (3 hours worth, 5% of grade)\none 3-4 page assignment due late November (5% of grade)\nthree exams (30% each, one in early October, one in mid/late November, one on the last day of class, to give a time reference)\n"

I got an A+ by scoring 95+ on all 3 midterms and didn't have to take the final, so don't even think of dismissing this review as a bitter reaction to a blow to my GPA. \nIf you are serious about neuroscience and have done well in Science of Psych and any course that covers the basics of the nervous system, I expect you will be as pissed off as I was to be wasting your time reviewing things you learned well enough in previous classes, but this time less clearly and buried in the middle of unbearable lectures that reliably start 10 minutes late and contain more tangential personal anecdote stories, common sense statements, and circumlocutions (she starts almost every sentence with the phrase \"There's this idea that\"...) than actual course content.\nAs previous reviewers have stated, Taylor feeds you the exam material with a spoon. She makes it obvious what topics she wants you to be able to regurgitate and if you do just that, you will have no problem with the exams. This may seem like a plus, unless you actually expect to be challenged and to learn concepts with the degree of rigor that will serve you in higher-level courses and/or graduate school.\nThe textbook used in Spring '11 (Kolb and Whishaw, An Introduction to Brain and Behavior) was completely inane. This was the first time this text was used and Taylor admitted that it wasn't as rigorous as she liked, but thought it was better than the previously used book, which was much heavier on detail. Pretty sure I would have much preferred the previous book. I hope she finds a better alternative for next spring.\nIf you are able to take an alternative course to fulfill a Psych/Neuro requirement, I seriously encourage you to at least shop that other class in case you find Taylor as infuriating as I did.\nWorkload:\n3 midterms, 1 final. Only 3 exams count toward your grade, so if you are satisfied with your cumulative midterm score, you don't have to take the final (highly recommended - this way you can use reading week/etc to study for other classes you might actually find valuable). One written assignment where you have to write about a scientific journal article in layman's terms as if for a newspaper/magazine - not much work, but doesn't help you learn much either. One or two chapters to read a week; not too time-consuming.\n"

Behavioral Neuroscience is Prof Taylor's area and she is able to incorporate her own research and other research she encounters in her field into the course. I enjoyed going to lecture, even though the course was at the ungodly time of 9:15 AM. Where this course runs into problems is in the tests. The tests are almost completely free recall: fill in the blank, essay, diagrams, etc, though there is some matching. The tests are therefore much more difficult than say the Sci of Psy tests were. This is not a problem. It's a higher level class, the tests should be harder. Unfortunately, it was difficult to know what to study for the tests. Eventually I figured out that her tests were almost exclusively based on the study questions posted at the end of lecture. The $100 textbook was basically completely useless, but Prof Taylor still pretended like it wasn't.\nIf you want to see if Neuroscience is for you, this is a good course to take. I loved the course content, but was disappointed with the tests and my final grade. Just be careful not to make the same mistake I did and study from the textbook.\nWorkload:\nNot too bad. Do the study questions from each lecture and then study the responses. Prof Taylor makes study guides for the textbook which I suppose could be useful. There is a writing assignment which is annoying but not hard and only worth 5% of the final grade. Your highest test grade is worth 35% and the other two are worth 30%. There is an optional multiple choice final which you can take to replace a midterm grade. It was much easier than the midterms.\n"

In general the load of memorization is humongous, but doable.  What was disturbing about the class is professor Taylor''s attitude and disorganization. There were no office hours provided, no TA, and she would never answer  the emails on time. She posted her lectures and study guides literally last minute claiming that she might have forgot to press the last button. The woman was clearly unorganized. Just her statement that she does not encourage arranging the meeting with her unless it is absolutely necessary says it all about her commitment to the class. I agree with the reviewers that she is indeed really passionate about her subject, but unless you are a science major you won't share her excitement. She is a really harsh grader and even if you know the material from the book, which by the way according to her is \"not needed for the class\" you won't get the proper grade.

Get out of it at all costs, if you don't you'll be writing a review just like this to warn your fellow classmates.  \n     I have NEVER had a class at Columbia where a professor consistently does not show up to their office hours.  I went to her office hours 3 times, and on each occasion I waited the entire time and she never showed.  On top of this, she did not send out any emails indicating that she wouldn't be able to make it.  I also emailed her on multiple occasions and did not receive any response at all.  She also missed a few lectures without bothering to send out an email.  \n     She was the queen of breaking promises.  She always put study guides up late.  For example:  we'd get a 8 page study guide (I'm talking in depth and complicated with 30 questions dedicated the physiology of the eye) on a Friday with the exam on a Tuesday DURING midterms.  The review session was on Sunday and I didn't get through even two pages of the study guide by that time!  She also returned our assignments sometimes up to 3 weeks late.   \n     Another annoying aspect of this class is the fact that she is constantly confused as to what she has lectured on before.  There have been at least 3 classes where we repeated the same material from a previous lecture.  \n      She relied on her T.A.'s to do absolutely everything since she was rarely available.  All she had to do was make up the lectures and make it to class- and she was unable to do this.  I will also add in as a side note that the first few weeks of class you will think you have a good handle on the material and that you are prepared for the exams-wrong!  Just wait until you get the study guide...  \n     I did well in this course, but that is partly because I have been in the psychology department for a few years here, and much of this was review to me.  This is NOT the class to take for your science requirement.  \n     I love Columbia and I have had the privilege of being taught by some of the best professors in the world in my 4 years at this school.  That's why I can tell you:  Taylor is an embarrassment to Columbia.  It's one thing not to be a talented professor, it's another thing entirely not to put in any effort whatsoever.

On each test there is an extra credit option and she is very generous with those. \nWorkload:\nAssigned reading is not that heavy. In order to do well in the class, the reading is not really necessary, but it is helpful if there is something that you don't understand. She posts lecture notes and outlines that are extremely helpful and for the test, she basically expects you just to know what was taught in the lectures. \n"

However, I found Intro to Psych with Taylor to be just fine.  I learned all the basics and it was not difficult.  She's not the most on time professor and it does take her a while to get tests back, but that isn't really important for a non-cumulative intro class.   Overall, she was a fine teacher, and a bit more easy than Stokes would have been (as I heard from friends in Stokes's class).  \nWorkload:\n3 easy 3 page papers each followed by an exam.  Chance for extra credit at the end of the term.  The first exam on Neuropsychology is tougher but your final grade weighs the last (and easiest-social psych and disorders) slightly heavier.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Taylor is one of the most intelligent, articulate and understanding professors I have encountered at Columbia. Although the concepts are not particularly complex, she explains everything slowly, clearly and in the most simple way possible. She even posts her lecture notes online so that you know what she thinks are the important points. Her lectures are straight-forward and enjoyable, filled with entertaining stories about her kids, interactive games and interesting videos. She allows tons of time for discussion and gladly answers all questions, even when they are about Student A's cousin Bob or Grandma Milda. She is extremely personable and easy to relate to because she is the type of woman who, for example, doesn't give cummulative exams because she \"hated them when she was a student\". More than any Prof. I have had, Taylor comes off as a \"real person\", with errands to run and kids to deal with. Sometimes she's in a bad mood and sometimes she's busy. So are the rest of us. She may not have handed back the midterm until two weeks before the final, but the exams were not cummulative! Having it back any earlier wouldn't have helped. My advice: Take Intro with Taylor!\nWorkload:\n3 exams that included a take-home essay. Just make sure you really read the textbook. All of the exams have extra credit questions and several people in the class recieved grades of over 100% on the tests. Note: The third exam was much more difficult than the first two, so make sure you learn even the most trivial details in the development chapter, even if you don't cover any of it in class.\n"

If you do need to ask a question, no matter what it is, she will look at you like you are dead stupid and answer with a tone of voice that implies disgust at having to help someone so incredibly unintelligent.  The previous reviewers were all right - she will take weeks to hand anything back and will email you with details way too late.  Just remember that you are on your own in this lab.  Don't count on her to explain anything initially, nor to help you out if you have a question.\nI do have something good to say about Professor Taylor, though.

All in all, ironically, the lecture, which was insanely hard, kind of saved my grade in this class because of her amazing ability to never hand back assignments and give no evaluation as to your progress.  Psych majors, you probably can't get through the major without having her for lab, just know you're in for a long haul that should be worth way more than 1.5 credits due to the hours you might spend agonizing over exactly how to make the excel graph that meets her wacked out standards.\nWorkload:\nNot so bad in the beginning, but she never hands things back on time so you have no sense of how you're doing.

The experiments you do are simple and do reinforce what you've learned from the lectures and reading, but the administrator was disorganized. As other students have mentioned here, Taylor does not return work in a timely fashion. As a first-time lab student, I didn't know how to write a lab report, and it was frustrating that I kept getting \"check minus\" as a grade because Taylor didn't return any of my previous work so that I could see what I was doing wrong. I think we got three weeks' worth of lab reports back during the last session! She posted the data from our big experiment online later than she'd told us she would, but we were not granted an extension even though this was not our fault. Furthermore, she answered student e-mails and sent us new data 12 hours before the huge report was due! She also struck me as an impatient person who didn't understand why a  student could possibly be confused by results, how to write lab reports, etc. She does make herself available in office hours, and I think she is a nice person at heart, but this lab was like one big mosquito bite that lasted all semester, if you smell my meaning.\nWorkload:\nYou do a write-up about the experiment completed in class that week. It's generally just one or two sections of the complete lab report - Methods, or Results, etc. Make sure you read the lab report manual because she is a picky grader and you don't get previous work back for weeks on end, so you cannot learn from past mistakes right away.
