            "review_content": "\nThat this course- and this-professor should somehow coexist disrupts the flow of the universe. If you Reader are wise, you will be less so if you take this class because it will inhibit the growth of new synaptic pathways. You will leave class depressed, and if the reason is not perceivable at first, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be too hard on yourself. Having to slow your thinking to the middle-school-pace of the class has affected your capacity for self-analysis. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re depressed because you are wasting your intellectual and creative powers on this course: you feel degraded. ...If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a relationship, take pains not to let these feelings get between you and the one you care for. \nWhether the class would be any different if taught by another professor is irrelevant, if only because this professor designed the course. And the professor, she is in critical need of evaluation regarding pedagogical ethics. To begin with, is it not a conflict of interest to ask that students purchase a book that she both edited and wrote the notes and introduction to; and of which, the course centers? Too, is it not a mistake to use the majority of class to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshamelessly promote\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfriends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and oneself? Should students at the university level be given assignments wherein they must design a book-cover, which it just so happens is for the same book the students have been asked to buy? (A note is called-for here: I have been told that a student asked to use a different edition than the one edited by the professor; they were informed that they could not, because their edition did not have the professor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notes and introduction. Though this account isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t verifiable, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mentioning is appropriate.)\nI have written at length if only because I feel one shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to endure what I have experienced taking this class. I was-sent an email by the professor regarding her book-cover assignment, wherein I was-told my design wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t geared-enough toward \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcselling the book.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 That a professor grades according to what she thinks will sell - what will sell the book she has edited - is news to me. Finally, I should mention that the grade I received for this course is high, which is surprising given that my principles forbade me from following most of her instructions; so I do not write out of malice. I just think the course should be eradicated.  \n\nWorkload:\nPointlessly easy: and therefore not easy.\n"

In addition, several NYC-based field trips provide a better understanding of Whitman's life circa the early 19th Century. This class is a wonderful way to spend the summer because of Karen. She is a great professor who exudes \"WHITMANIA!\"\nWorkload:\n4 short papers/projects - weekly discussion posting -oral presentation - final project or paper, your choice.\n"

            "review_content": "\nKaren Karbiener is a wonderful teacher and all her students quickly become Whitmaniacs. Her knowledge about  her field and her way of communicating it to her students reflect positively on each other. Her teching is clear, well organized and she has a sense of guiding you in your answers that really opens your ideas on poetry the way you would not think you could manage to understand or be able to do it. She is fond of Walt Whitman and all the class will be too. The spirit of the class imprinted by its teacher is wonderful. We visit some NY sites relied to Whitman's work and that's a plus to the group, also to get to know each other.\nThe work load is totally manageable; short (1-2p) weekly papers, weekly discussion board, 1 presentation and one final paper. The class is only taught during summer session. Sign up quickly because it fills up as soon as it is posted - If you are on a waiting list, send Karen an e-mail and go to the first class. \nAll Whitmaniacs I meet are so sorry the class is over... I can only recomend this class\nWorkload:\nThe workload is totally manageable: readings: 4 books (not in total) papers: weekly short papers (1-2 p.), 1 weekly discussion board, 1 oral presentation, 1 final research paper 7-9 pages. She loves when you visit her in her office... \n"

She's more than fair with her grading, funny, extremely nice, and young enough that students can easily relate to her. Plus, she's full of crazy/original interpretations that make for great entertainment. Easily the best teacher I've had in Columbia. \nWorkload:\n2-3 papers per semester, midterm, final\n"

She doesn't give too many papers, and they make up the entire course load. She is always willing to listen during her office hours, about the class or life in general. Perhaps one of the greatest introductory teachers there is.\n"
