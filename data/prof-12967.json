            "review_content": "\nProfessor Terry's class has been one of my favorite classes at Columbia.  She is extremely sharp, has a strong, firecracker personality, and can be very blunt, which keeps her lectures and anecdotes rather interesting and at times, humorous.  She is an engaging lecturer who is clearly a passionate expert in her field.  Her lectures aren't a rehash of the readings; instead, she provides new insight and frameworks by which to further analyse the readings she assigns.  I learned a lot about Korean Politics, and her focus on policy and practicality was refreshing.\nWorkload:\nThe workload is pretty manageable. There is a medium amount of reading, one in-class midterm, a short in-class presentation (ppt optional), and a final 10page policy options paper. I highly recommend that you see her during office hours, especially for the policy options paper. \n"
