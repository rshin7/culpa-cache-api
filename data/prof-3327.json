            "review_content": "\nFang Laoshi is a new, young teacher who's teaching part-\ntime here and at NYU. I like her a lot- she's not the most fun teacher, but she's an easy grader and very organized. She also always lets class out a little early, and never takes attendance. A lot of studnets gave her a tough time, but I really liked her teaching style. THe one complaint I have is that she wasn't very flexible- if someone didn't understand a concept she wouldn't spend much extra time explaining it, and would just continue the class as scheduled. \nWorkload:\nMinimal- a dictation almost every day (the lowest two grades are dropped) and a test for every 2 lessons (very easy A's)\n"
