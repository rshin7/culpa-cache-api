Although he was a grad student at the time, he had more poise than some tenured professors here at Columbia.  He's a natural.  His knowledge about Medieval European History in general, as well as literature and philosophy is pretty impressive.  He was funny, and the class never got boring.  On the last day of class, he brough in lots of yummy candy for the entire class to enjoy.  If he's a TA in any of your classes, take his section!  Take any class he teaches.   He's a fair grader, but he expects you to participate in class discussions in order to award a good grade.\nWorkload:\nWeekly Primary Source Readings,  4 or 5  Secondary Souce Books, 2 Quizzes and a Final Paper.  \n"
