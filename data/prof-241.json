He's really open to class discussions and the ideas students bring. Plus, he'll question or challenge what students say so the discussion is actually substantial, not just a person speaking to get their participation points. \nHe's also good with extensions if you ask for them, just don't get carried away and ask for too many; in his own words \"i don't like feeling like i'm being taken advantage of.\" \nHe allows rewrites so take advantage of those to help your grade. i've also found that they help me understand the text better so i recommend doing at least one\nEnjoy your year with Bruce\nWorkload:\nnormal lit hum readings. may fall a class behind because of discussions\n4 papers/semester: 3 can be rewritten after grading, the other is turned in the day of the final\nno midterm, which is great but there is the standardized final\nfair grader\n"
