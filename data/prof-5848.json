            "review_content": "\nQuantum Mechanics is a tough class.  No getting around that.  Unless you are one of the handful of people ruining the curve because you have taken Brian Greene's equivalent course already or are enrolled in both.  Despite the large amount of variation in background, the class was my favorite this semester.  The material is really interesting and Prof. Mueller is not bad lecturer.\nPros\n--Mueller is really nice\n--Questions are answered graciously\n--The material is interesting\nCons\n--The book, Gasiorowicz, is not great.  The problems are impossible, there are no examples, and the explanations are brief.\n--Because of the variety of backgrounds of the students in the class, the curve hurts\n--Prof. Mueller goes through the material very quickly.\nOverall, a good class.\nWorkload:\nHomework doesn't count for the grade and the exams do not resemble the problem sets in the slightest.  However, if you do the homework, you will get a lot more out of the class.\n"
