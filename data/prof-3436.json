            "review_content": "\nWhat a wonderful teacher and woman. I've never been so encouraged to learn a language, and with such rigor and fun. Sophie clearly knows how to teach French, and how to relay difficult concepts to (frankly) lazy summer students. I appreciated that she corrected our pronunciation at every point. I walked into the class with barely any memory of French and walked out with what feels like 3 semesters' worth. Also, I took the course for fun, mostly, but after seeing Sophie's dedication, I studied hard and just wanted to do well for her \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0because she was putting in so much effort to teach us the material! Not only is Sophie the most effective teacher I've ever had at Columbia, but also she's the most patient and the kindest (with a great sense of humor, too). Very maternal and Mother Nature-like. I looked forward to coming to class everyday, and I'll miss her.\nWorkload:\nA bit of work, but worth it for the French you'll learn (if you care)\n"

            "review_content": "\nWhat an absolutely fantastic professor!  She really went the extra mile for the 15 of us -- we had four compositions, four exams, lots of exercises, and she--not a TA--graded them *all*, added encouraging comments, gave us rewrite opportunities, and returned all graded assignments the very next day without fail.  The course went two hours every day in the summer, M, Tu, W, Th--a punishing schedule--but she was always impeccably prepared, energetic, and fun.  \nSince she is a native speaker, her accent was obviously a perfect model, but she could also explain the grammatical rules right away, without grasping for them.  This is a fairly rare combination in a language instructor; normally one gets either the pronunciation or the fine points on grammar, but we got both.  It's easy for an instructor to \"wing it\" on easy material, but it seemed like she truly prepared before class.  \nAs if this weren't enough, there are more semi-optional resources for your enjoyment than you could ever hope to look at on Courseworks--French music videos (with transcribed lyrics!), French movies, poem recitation, all of which it seems she picked out.  Courseworks is used very effectively.  There were even web-sites she designed for oral comprehension (hosted at Carnegie Mellon). \nI have taken many language courses in the past, some at universities with nominally first-rate language departments, but Sophie is the best language instructor I ever had, and the course was structured thoughtfully.  Highest possible recommendation.\nWorkload:\nFour compositions, four exams, one oral presenation, tons of workbook exercises--we covered the whole textbook.   Not for the faint of heart, but It's French grammar, so there's no other way to learn it for real.  n.b. This course was highly compressed (in five weeks over Summer Session I), so the pace during the year would be more forgiving. \n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Queuniet was an excellent teacher.  She really tried to keep the class motivated and excited about the material, and if the class weren't at 9 a.m., she might have been successful.  The grammar is important for the exams, but not so much for class discussion.  The readings can be tedious and rather boring, but \"La regle du jeu\" makes it all worth while.  Professor Queuniet is extremely attentive and will gladly explain any concepts with which you need help.  She is also a native speaker, but admits she doesn't know everything there is to know about French, which leads to a lot of funny moments in class where she consults wordreference.com or the textbook.  She doesn't do a very good job of explaining the different types of papers: resume, dissertation, explication de texte, and the one we didn't get to.\nWorkload:\n4 or 5 exams, 4 papers (3 for my section because we ran out of time), and a slurry of readings from the course packet as well as grammar exercises.\n"

Sophie isn't afraid to admit that she doesn't know something; she will promptly look it up and give you the answer you desire.\n6. Sophie is open to suggestions.\n7. Sophie encourages learning from mistakes.\n8. Sophie isn't afraid to criticize her teaching style or curriculum.\n9.

The workload was average, we had a short quiz every week or two and a few assigned readings from the standard textbooks per week. What you'd expect for a 4 point course. On top of that, she's just such a sweetheart, and genuinely cares about your progress in the course. \nSophie will make an effort to let you know what areas are pulling your mark down so that you have a chance to boost your grade before it's too late to change anything.\n\nWorkload:\nAverage for a language course.\n"
