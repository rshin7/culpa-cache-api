            "review_content": "\nAmanda Claybaugh is in love with the sound of her own voice. I imagine this is useful if you're lecturing several times a week but I found her fairly insufferable. She lectures so breathlessly fast that keeping up longhand is nearly impossible. A laptop is de rigeur. On more than one occasion, she was snide and condescending when a student asked a question that she deemed unworthy. In response to one poor fellow, she actually rolled her eyes and said, \"I can't believe you're asking me that!\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201d I couldn't believe her rudeness. Her most common tactic, in dealing with questions from the class, was to interrupt before the questioner finished and then complete what she imagined the question was herself. She did this to me once and her response to my unfinished question had little to do with what I was actually aiming at. The overall impression was that she already knew where the question was going (although she often didn't) and that it probably wasn't that important anyway, such was her rush to get back to her priceless analysis. All of this was annoying but the mid-term and final were absolutely infuriating. In the exam instructions there was a Strict Injunction against parroting her interpretations of the texts when giving your answers. Then, in lieu of returning exams with comments (which I think is the least one can expect at Columbia), the TAs  instead handed out a compendium of the best answers they had culled from the lot\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsheer laziness. And what do you suppose those creme-de-la-creme answers were? Yep. They were, note-for-note, regurgitation of Claybaugh's text interpretations. I wanted to scream. I had  made every effort to avoid repeating what she had said, which wasn't easy since she had said a great deal. When it came to the final I simply repeated every point about the texts that she had made in class and\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsurprise!\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI got an 'A'. So you got penalized for following directions and they couldn't be bothered to actually make individual suggestions/comments on your exams. Isn't the point of a lit course to come up with your own ideas about the text and have your work critiqued individually? Not in this class. \nHow sad that a professor's ego should take precedence over a student actually thinking for herself and learning something. I have had other lit professors that actually took the time and trouble to engage the students and attempt to draw them out when discussing the texts as opposed to Claybaugh, who seems to regard the class as a distraction at worst and a fawning audience (just read the other reviews here to see what I mean) at best. \nClearly she is hyper intelligent and a master of her domain but the way that she ran this class left a lot to be desired. Oh, and in case you think I have an ax to grind here, I got an 'A' in the class. \n\nWorkload:\nLots of reading but no more than you might expect in such a course.\nTwo lectures and one discussion section per week. Two open-book exams (which I think is a fine idea for a lit class) and one 10-12 page paper. \n"

I have never seen any professor be so on-the-ball all the freaking time. \nHaving said that, her seminar was absolutely wonderful. The material was good, the discussions were good, and the homework assignments helped tremendously. The only tough part about her class was the she demanded so much out of her students in terms of thinking and writing.

She is, quite simply, astoundingly brilliant, and made our seminar into the most intensive and rewarding lit class I've taken here.  Any professor who can make Nathaniel Hawthorne seem new and exciting is doing something really amazing. As a seminar she completely managed to provide her own insights and encourage student discussion - I never felt like anyone was monopolizing class time, although I could definitely watch her draw character diagrams on the chalkboard for hours.\nShe has an endearing sense of humor and a very warm personality. I don't agree with reviewers who called her \"pedantic\" or \"pretentious\", although she definitely does not stand for wasting time or intellectual laziness. This class pushed me more than any other in terms of making connections and observations, and Prof. Claybaugh really nurtured an open environment of intellectualism. I'm in awe of her brilliant insights and her desire to encourage her students' intellectual development, as well as her dedication to her classes. I could go on, but any English major who doesn't take a class with Prof. Claybaugh is doing themselves a disservice. If you're willing to do the mental work necessary for her classes, the rewards are quite worth it. She completely deserves the awards that she's won, and hopefully she'll stay at CU for many years.\nWorkload:\nNot bad for a seminar: six novels (two weeks per book), biweekly 1-pg response papers, a very short 5-7 pg final paper (although she has high expectations, so I spent as much time on it as I would on a longer paper). Grading was fair.\n"

This year I'm studying Victorian lit at Oxford, and it's amazing how much easier it is for me to analyze even the books I hadn't read before, just because Amanda really teaches us how to analyze.  I can now make connections I never could have made if this were my first time taking this subject.  I had never really practiced her type of analysis before: Instead of a thematic analysis, we do a structural one in which we learn how the book is put together.  While that can seem limiting and sometimes not as interesting, it's incredible how much easier it is to do thematic analysis after practicing taking apart the structure so many times.  Not only is Amanda brilliant, but she's such a nice person.  I was so nervous when I went to talk to her at office hours, but she made me feel so comfortable and went out of her way to make me feel relieved and good about myself walking out.  This has definitely been the most rewarding class I've taken at Columbia.\nWorkload:\nIt's really not that bad.  The books are long, as Victorian novels tend to be: Mansfield Park, Jane Eyre, Bleak House, Middlemarch, Jude the Obscure, Picture of Dorian Gray, and Heart of Darkness...but we only have one essay, a midterm, and a final.  The midterm was graded very easily: I didn't time it well and only had 4 minutes to write the third essay (which obviously turned out horribly) and still managed to get an A.  The essay was graded fairly.  If you have any interest at all in this era of literature, definitely take this class.\n"

The reading list is great: Mansfield Park, Jane Eyre, Bleak House, Middle March, Jude the Obscure, Picture of Dorian Gray and Heart of Darkness. My only complaint is that she's very...historical. Which is fitting, I guess, but I was looking for more of a thematic analysis of the books. We'd never discuss WHY someone did something but the historical context around that decision. So, too, her expectations are different. In exams and papers, she asks for a formal analysis of character, plot  and narration rather than a structural one. It was so foreign to us that the TA actually had to get up and explain what a formal analysis was! Bottom line: her style takes a little getting used, to -- but it was definitely an enjoyable experience. She gets excited student response to literature, she's lerned, and is SO helpful during office hours.\nWorkload:\nthe aforementioned books as required reading (read them, even the \"800 page monsters\" you'll feel so accomplished afterwards).

In my opinion, this class is a must for anyone who enjoys great literature and a great professor (a definite for English majors). Claybaugh is enlightening...I just can't say enough good things about this woman. Her lectures are riveting and I never missed a single one...ever. Her lecture style is captivating and she always makes the most fascinating points concerning the texts. I particularly enjoyed her contextualization of the novels. It's also nice to be taught by a professor who has true passion for the material. Claybaugh's personal attachment to these texts is apparent and really helped me to engage in the books. As my fellow reviewers have noted...this class comes with a very heavy workload. Each of the 7 texts are remarkable, however. Well worth the time put in. In the middle of the semester, we read two EXTREMELY LONG (1000 pages each) and dense texts (Bleak House, Dickens and Middlemarch, Eliot). Reading assignments were heavy, but reasonable. You can catch up on a week's worth of reading during the weekend, but DO NOT make this a regular practice...DO NOT let your readings slip!!! You will feel guilty about it and the lectures will frustrate you (because they're wonderful and you won't know what the hell everyone's talking about). Of course, you'll be screwed in the end if you've let more than one book slide, cause the final will be impossible. The workload is two papers and a take-home final. About the papers...they are a real opportunity for you to \"show your stuff.\" Claybaugh really encourages her students to explore the texts, NOT to re-hash class discussion. The topics, at first, seem insipid (in the vein of \"pets\" or \"acting\") but their minimalist nature really allows you to do with it what you want. And, of course, you can always come up with your own topic, provided that you give advanced notice. Hint *Claybaugh is big on close readings of the texts as far as the papers go. I was frustrated by the fact that Claybaugh doesn't grade the papers. I am not a big fan of TAs and try to avoid them at all costs, but the TA from this course actually proved to be pretty helpful. Grading was more than fair. Take a class with this woman if at all possible. She's phenomenal and her lectures are truly inspiring.

Also, if you're a guy, prepare to take a few shots in the ribs. She's a feaux-friendly feminist.\nWorkload:\nUnreasonable. If you want to get a good grade, make sure you can devour Victorian novels like a starving sumo.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAgreeing with the previous reviewer, I'd add that if you don't take this class, definitely get Professor Claybaugh for something else. Her brilliant lectures make you feel guilty for falling behind on the readings, and she consistently manages to brighten texts that seem awfully dull when you're reading them at 2 in the morning. Try to make it to her office hours; what she has to say is far more interesting than what you'll get from the TA.\nWorkload:\nLots of reading, but you'll feel very proud if you can finish it all. 2 essays, take-home final. No in-class tests, which was a big plus.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class was great! Filled with lots of interesting information about the 19th century and with one of the most fun reading lists I've seen yet. Professor Claybaugh has a way of making lectures both entertaining and informative, and I never minded coming to class. On the down side, these are 19th century novels, so they are HUGE, and if you get behind on the reading, you will never catch up. Grading was tough, but very fair. This isn't a class where you are going to be able to get away with writing a paper in 2 hours the night before it's due and pulling an A, but there's nothing mysterious about the grading, and if you put some effort into writing a decent paper, you will get a good grade. The heavy reading and real grading standards may make this class a bad choice for seniors looking to blow off their senior year, but I'd highly recommend it for anyone who wants an interesting and stimulating class where you'll actually learn something.\nWorkload:\nreading: 7 novels including two monsters (800+ pages), writing: 2 6-8 page papers and a take-home final.\n"
