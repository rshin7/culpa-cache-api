            "review_content": "\nAfter having had Mr. Leonard for a semester of CC, I can agree with the previous reviews--he's a perfectly good CC professor. His classes weren't the kind of thing you rave about, but the kind of class you don't mind attending for four hours a week. He has a relaxed attitude that is friendly enough, and a subtle self-depreciating sense of humor that, on the very rare occasions it appeared, made me marvel at where it had been hiding. Yes, the hours can get long, especially towards the end of each class, but as long as more than two people have actually read the text, the class discussion should have no trouble carrying the day. \nFrankly, there are some CC teachers who ARE horrible. I have had Core teachers so soul-crushingly bad they have made me never want to pick up a book again. I was VERY happy to land in Mr. Leonard's class, and when shopping around for a good CC section, keep in mind that in a pool containing legitimately awful professors, Mr. Leonard is a welcome choice.\nOn a side note, towards the end of the semester I finally realized who he had been reminding me of--he looks just a little like Robert Sean Leonard from House MD. Anyone else? \nWorkload:\nFor my class, he replaced the midterm with a smattering of in-class exercises, such as writing a short comparison of quotes or group work. He called them \"quizzes\" with heavy air quotes. 2 papers. One final, in which there are passage IDs, short writing bit, long essay bit. Normal CC reading load. \n"

            "review_content": "\nInitially concerned about having Daniel Leonard after having read old CULPA reviews, I was relieved to find that he was a fine Lit Hum professor.  Lit Hum could have been a much better experience, but it also could have been much worse.  He knows the material well, comes to class well prepared with discussion ideas and specific passages, and though the class drags on for the 2 hours, I did learn a lot.  The workload was manageable - usual Lit Hum reading list, 2 papers, and second semester he added on weekly CourseWorks postings about that week's reading especially vital for the participation grades of those who do not speak much in class.  He is by no means an easy grader, caring more about the nuances and development of ideas in essays than whether or not people can write well, but when it comes to the midterm and final he understands that people cannot write the most beautifully constructed responses given the time constraints and grades accordingly.  \nWorkload:\nLit Hum reading list (with some substitutions of passages he likes better than the ones assigned), 2 papers, midterm (1st semester in class, 2nd semester take home), final\n"

            "review_content": "\nI was mortified when I got Professor Leonard as a teacher instead of Elizabeth Amann, who I was preregistered for. This was based solely on the CULPA reviews, which painted a really bad picture of him. We were all predisposed to disliking him because of this, but I had a very positive experience. I'm going to go ahead and assume he has changed in the past few years, so you should really consider the more recent reviews before you freak out.\nHe's laid back, and he's not so caught up in the grandeur of being a core teacher. I even recall one of the older reviews saying he openly states he's not a fan of the core, which I can't validate (I could see it being true though). While Professor Leonard does like to talk and is rather dry, there aren't many ways to teacher these texts in an exciting way. Part of what is supposed to make it interesting is DISCUSSION, something that he is very open to but you have to facilitate. He does not give quizzes, or very many supplementary assignments (we had one). That said, in order to not be bored you actually have do the readings and participate. That's a pretty mature thing to ask of, for all intents and purposes, lazy high school seniors (first semester college, you're not that different) who probably still use SparkNotes, but it's worth it. To me at least, this sort of class is superior to other Lit Hum sections where you mindlessly get a quiz every class...\nLeonard isn't too big on deadlines- they're usually extended and he's pretty understanding with conflicts like sickness or sports. Oh yeah, did I mention he gives Extra Credit? And for the final review he brings Starbucks and to the final he brings snacks... he's a good guy, in that he feeds college students, if anything. It could be that he cares a lot, or doesn't care to the point where he becomes easy-going.\nWorkload:\n-Read.\n-Come to class.\n-Two Essays (don't expect them back in a timely fashion)\n-Midterm\n-Cumulative Final\n-Extra Credit\n-One Page Responses, we literally got only one.\n"

He might not be the best out there, but you get the full Columbia Core experience from him.\nI don't really know how to compare Lit Hum professors because they all seem to have different teaching styles and different specialties.  Some like to turn every text into a message about women's rights, and some like to strip out the underlying philosophical arguments and spend the whole time analyzing those.  From my point of view, Leonard is a straight up classic Lit Hum professor.  We analyze the prose, characters, ideas, context, and author.  We learn a little about everything.  \nAs some reviewers have said, Leonard likes to go on long speeches about something.  I don't think that is the best use of time during a discussion class, but what he is saying is worthwhile.  I think there is room for improvement with regard to class discussions, but by no means does he discourage people from asking questions and arguing.  \nSometime he brings in supplementary pictures and essays by people that add to the readings.  You aren't required to read them, but they are interesting and there if you really want to delve into the subject.  I think it shows that he really knows the context and impact of each text.  He reads along with us every class ( I think).\nAlthough I've never been to his office hours, I think he has them for several hours after each class at Brownies (the business schools cafe).  \nDon't despair if you get Leonard for Lit Hum!

It's just discussion. \nI wouldn't suggest taking a class with him if you don't like discussion, because he seems to like it a lot. His grading is extremely confusing. He graciously allowed us to do rough drafts of our first papers, and trade with another student for peer reviewal. However, he read only our final drafts, and we didn't get any feedback from him before we received our final grades. Then he had the nerve to say, \"None of these papers were very good.\" We were all less then pleased, both with him and our grades. If you're looking for a professor that seems to go out of his way to help his students, Professor Leonard isn't for you. He also is fond of sending additional assignments over e-\nmail...Everyone's favorite.

While many of my peers slept straight through the semester, literally sprawled and drooling on the table right next to him, I absorbed quite a few chunks of wisdom from the guy.  He is definitely a teacher that does his homework.  He always came prepared to class with carefully analyzed passages to talk about and often brought up really interesting points I never would have thought of on my own.  With the load of books we have to pack into the semester, who has the time to consider that Homer spares the bard in the Odyssey from murder?  Daniel does the work of careful reading for you.  Although I admit, I had days when I looked at the clock every other minute, I have to give him credit for his well thought out lessons (and incredible enunciation!).  On the other hand, though he brought interesting points to the table, he didn\u00c2\u2019t do a great job of involving the class in conversation.  He certainly tried by asking us many questions, wanting our view and opinions, but somehow he couldn\u00c2\u2019t ever start that rousing debate English teachers seek.  If you do speak, he listens carefully, and your point will be acknowledged with an \"excellent\", or at least a \"great\", but in my class, people would rarely contribute.  Oh what patience Daniel had!  He could wait through whole, awkward minutes of silence before he would give up on us answering.  His tolerance was almost maddening at times when half the class wouldn\u00c2\u2019t show up some days and he wouldn\u00c2\u2019t say a word, or people would practically fall asleep on top of his notes and he wouldn\u00c2\u2019t so much as give them a nudge.  He is such a nice guy you should almost feel guilty not taking this class.\nWorkload:\nLight, I hear, compared to other Legacy classes.  We wrote two papers, the ten page required paper for First Year Seminars, and a reaction paper roughly every other week.  As long as you write a mini analytical essay for each reaction paper, Daniel will be happy (single space if you must).  He gives the same grade for every piece of work you turn in, so start off on the right foot.\n"
