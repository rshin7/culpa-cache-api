This is a great class for learning or improving drawing no matter what your level.  This class definitely gave me a better appreciation for art as well.\nAbout four weeks of the class is devoted to figure drawing from live models.  Several classes are taken by discussions with guest artists and trips to museums/galleries.  There is a lot of freedom in the class, especially later on, for experimenting with abstraction, materials, and style.  The early classes are much more guided to train the student in seeing what is there and putting it on paper.  Great class.\nWorkload:\n~3 drawings a week until the last month.  1 final project\n"
