You'll wish you were born the same year she was-- just so you could have been friends with her in high school.\nWorkload:\nNothing to speak of.  Fun!\n"

Her class is geared to the theory courses, but at the same time, is able to meet the needs of individual students even during the short class time (50 min). She is extremely nice about absences, and very flexible with the few outside assignments of the semester (nothing hard at all). You\u00c2\u2019ll definitely want to take Victoria if you\u00c2\u2019re in any of Prof. Cohen\u00c2\u2019s classes \u00c2\u2013 because she\u00c2\u2019ll really improve you\u00c2\u2019re intuition in harmonic function and progression \u00c2\u2013 Cohen\u00c2\u2019s pet peve. \nWorkload:\nA few quizzes, and a few out of class transcriptions, no outside prep necessary whatsoever.\n"

Really friendly and nice as well, so class isn't awkward, as some small 50 minute classes can be. And she really kicked some major ass getting the 10 of us to sing at 9:00am - i don't know how she did it, but she did!\nWorkload:\n2 short tests; light, light homework (like 30 minutes a week MAX)\n"

She is never critical or impatient and will spend as much extra time with you as you'd like if you're not getting the key concepts of the course. Victoria is such a sweetie; I don't think anybody could complain about having her as a TA.\nWorkload:\nVery light. Three short in-class exams. You don't have to do most of the homework. Not a problem. \n"

She gives every student individual attention (also due to the small class size) so all problems can be corrected. Always speak up and ask if you have questions.
