I used to hate english, but Sarah even made writing about the driest of subjects fun and intriguing. If you can take her class, you definitely should. She's very relaxed and understands if you need to turn in a paper late. She is also very willing to help you if you need it.\nWorkload:\nManageable. Average for University Writing.\n"
