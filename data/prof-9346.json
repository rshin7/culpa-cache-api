He is incredibly friendly at office hours and helps with the problem sets.  \nMuj is very intelligent and explains the concepts better than Professor O'Flaherty himself.  I wish I could just go to Muj's recitation section because I get more out of it than two days of lecture.  \nI sincerely hope Muj will go on to pursue his Ph.D. in Economics & teach at Columbia someday.  He has changed my life.\n\nWorkload:\nVery, very easy. \n"
