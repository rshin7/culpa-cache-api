He generally came to class late, and then complained to us about having to be there at all. He rarely answered questions. When you did persuade him into answering a question, he gave the most convoluted crazy explanation any one of us had ever heard. Every time he spoke snickers could be heard throughout the class (and i was one of them). Whats worse, he did not give any of the quizzes back until the second to last week of the semester, so we did not know how we were doing. \n"

The worst part was that we had 8 quizzes and he was a lazy jerk and did not grade/submit the last three quiz grades, he refused to answer emails relating this problem and is generally a terrible human being and should never have been hired. \n"
