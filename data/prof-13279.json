Engages the entire class with thought-provoking discussion and really tries to make sure everyone feels like a part of the class.\nI can't think of any word other than \"chill\" to describe her. She certainly isn't overly permissive, but she is very understanding of our problems as students.\nShe always offers thoughtful feedback on essays in meetings, and I feel like she respects all of us as intelligent people with diverse but valid viewpoints.\nWorkload:\nNot too bad\nStandard CC reading, discussion questions due at 9pm before each class\n2 essays (7-10 pages), 1 midterm, and 1 final\n\n"
