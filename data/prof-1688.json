The articles he assigns are amazing though and make the class really worthwhile.  He definitely raised questions I had not thought of before in terms of a future career in medicine.  \nWatch out for the tests though.  He is NOT interested in independent thought.  There are 3 true/false tests during the semester and the final is a two question essay take-home.  Be wise a act like a parrot on the final.\nWorkload:\nmoderate.  Lots of reading but it's mostly really interesting.   Tests require memorization and practice.  The final is a crap shoot.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Litwak is a quirky, interesting and somewhat puzzling teacher. He knows what he's talking about, but often repeats himself. By the end of the semester the information kind of comes together, but a lot of time is wasted on repeating the last 20 minutes of the previous lecture.  Litwak's lectures are sometimes really entertaining, but it's not  in that funny-yet-I'm-learning way, more like oh-man-this-guy-is-old way.   Still, Litwak is amiable, I can't help but like him.  The bowtie gets me every time.  \nWorkload:\nArticles were very interesting, probably most worthwhile aspect of class. Four assignments (take home tests or essays) of varying worth, mostly regurgitation, some independent thinking. \n"
