The class was about Latin American cities and I feel much more prepared to study abroad after the experience.  Although he is a native speaker (from Mexico), he speaks slowly and clearly.  I think there are a lot of benefits to choosing him over non-native speakers as you get a much more authentic learning environment.  Everything was pretty straightforward and clear from day one. Take a class with him if you can.\nWorkload:\nReasonable.\n"
