            "review_content": "\nChristopher Park is excellent. My Diatonic class came in with different backgrounds, both in terms of instrumental and theory experience, but Park did an excellent job making sure everyone was challenged, but not drowning.\nThere are three main goals for the course: Counterpoint, Harmony and Keyboard Skills; these are pretty much the same whichever professor you have.\nPark introduces Counterpoint and Harmony right off the bat\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe'll begin with one or the other and then transition in the middle of class. I liked this approach: the difficulty of assignments grows more gradually with your skill level, you don't get bored with one or the other, and it's pretty easy to see the connections diatonic harmony has with species counterpoint.\nDon't worry about the Keyboard Skills, especially if you're not a pianist. They're simple exercises, and even outer voices was acceptable for most of them\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe TA will have you play one or two during the lab sessions, which were Friday afternoons both semesters for my class.\nWorkload:\nSuper manageable: a short counterpoint exercise and a few measures of harmony (usually either \"realise this figured bass\" or \"harmonise this melody, doing this thing here, etc.\" or \"write a few measures that do these things\") The last half of the second semester was mostly given to writing a five-part rondo, which got a little intense, but he's very forgiving if you're late and will let you redo exercises for improved grades.\nThe final and midterm will be very difficult, but he grades nicely.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Park is a musical equivalent of Dr. House- he has the same beard, the same attitude, and the same roundabout approach to his profession. He didn't give out a syllabus (which I heard was a big deal, but I'm not sure if anyone ever addressed formally) and he only gave out homework (which mostly consisted of theory exercises that never lasted more than 30 minutes) for about 4-5 classes. His lecturing style was basically ranting about different aspects of music theory until class time was over- I couldn't tell whether or not he actually had any set plan when class started. I had a great deal of previous experience from a jazz band in high school, but I suspect it would have been hard without that. Many of my classmates were struggling because he didn't spend that much time on basic stuff like scales and how to get around the circle of 5ths (he actually didn't spend much time connecting seventh chords to the circle fifths if at all).\nSyllabi and other major problems aside, he was a nice guy and he was always available for extra help. He made time for people that were still struggling with the basics and I think by the end everyone knew music theory a lot better. I would recommend him if you are okay taking a step away from conventional teaching styles.\nWorkload:\nVery light homework (less than 30 minutes), and he only gives it out on occasion. A straightforward (and pretty easy) midterm and a straightforward (and slightly less easy) final.\n"
