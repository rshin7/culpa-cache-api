He did indigenous dances, described in detail what it's like to trip on acid in the Amazon, and spoke at length that he believed our classroom was haunted (we consequently moved classrooms multiple times). I had Fernando as my TA, and the grading was relatively generous if you were decent at talking out of your a**. A few unbelievably pretentious hipsters ran the course and were thoroughly beloved by Taussig, almost to an inappropriate level. Overall, a hilarious lesson when a famous drug-addled anthropologist gets tenure at Columbia. \nWorkload:\nA lot of reading, but you don't really have to do much of it. About 5 papers + 1 ethnography that is semester-long and turned in at the end. No exams\n"

            "review_content": "\nMost difficult class I've taken at Columbia. However, Prof Taussig will give you back as much as you put into the course. The readings, discussions, and test demonstrations are intense (no oxygen tanks or snorkling masks allowed, only reeds) but well worth it! I had particular difficulty in the \"natural materials\" challenge. Hudson seaweed just isn't made for asymmetrical, post-modern baskets! However, this course reaffirmed my decision to major in Underwater BW. I know that this class will remain with me throughout my education and career as the fundamental foundation of my very being and intellectual reasoning system. \nSome people might call Underwater BW a \"joke major\" do not be disheartened by this! This is one of the most challenging majors at Columbia-- both mentally and physically! It combines environmental science, physics, chemistry, political science (negotiating with merpeople), and others! However, I would suggest that you begin breath holding/pressure/ oxygen absorption training ASAP over the summer as the high amounts of Pollution in the Hudson make it particularly difficult to absorb oxygen into your skin while weaving. \nWorkload:\nAT LEAST 2 coiled, plaiting, twining, AND split baskets by the end of the year, each created underwater without breaks in less than 10 minutes\nFor the final, one of these baskets must be made out of a material found in the Hudson-- I thought that Prof Taussig meant a natural item and used seaweed--what a mistake! Some other kid found an old tire and used that instead! He even got extra credit for recycling and using a lasting material. Whatever. If I'd known that that was allowed, I would've done it too.\n"

If he sets a class agenda for the day, he never finishes discussing all that he sets out to. \nThat said, you will read many of the fundamental texts of anthropology (Mauss, Malinowski, etc) and many interesting, but certainly off-beat texts (such as his own books, and others of his choosing such as Toward an Anarchist Theory of Anthropology).\nPersonally, I find his ramblings super-interesting. He is certainly not the kind of guy who lectures according to power-point presentation bullet points. If that's how you learn best, avoid this class. If bullet-point lecturing makes you want to kill yourself, you'll probably love Taussig; he's a storyteller. \nHe has lived on-and-off in Colombia (the country, not Columbia) since the 60's, and his specialty is looking at what the pervasive violence that both the successive governments and the FARC have wrought on the people. \nHe also knows loads about the cross-roads between indigenous, afro-colombian and Spanish cultures and talks a lot about their mingling. So if you are interested in anthropology and Latin America, Taussig is also a good bet. He loves students, so if these subjects, or approaches to anthropology interest you, feel free to drop by his office for a chat. \nWorkload:\nNo midterm, no final. However, you need to write a 5 page paper every other week or so (amounting to about 6 total) which are graded by TAs. I've heard these range from fantastic to awful, so do some scouting before signing up. \nIf paper-writing is not your thing, you can also submit art-projects (projects have ranged from sculpture to music-video) instead.\n"

Taussig's class is unique, as is he, and if you love professors who are PASSIONATE about the material, are hilarious because of their quirkiness, and know freakin everything about their subject then check him out. Taussig hates the stereotypical Columbia do-it-for-the-grade-and-to-get-the-right-answer student--he really wants you to read deeply, THINK about the material and get something out of it.

I read every single iota, participated in every discussion group, and  never missed a lecture or a discussions group.  However, this was not reflected in my grades.  To add insult to injury, I read some of the papers that received A's.   Some of these students constantly missed class, and failed to do readings. This was reflected in mediocre papers, yet they received the hightest grades!!  This is astounding to me.

            "review_content": "\nTaussig is great.  He's funny, enthusiastic, and definitely a character.  I heard from many before enrolling \"you'll never have another professor like him, enjoy it.\"  And he does indeed have a shining personality: most likely a hippie  back in the day (frequently starts the class with Doors playing in the background, showed Apocalypse Now the first week of class), definitely opinionated and not afraid to share it, a non-conformist and proud of it, but not at all obnoxious or condescending.  His crazy shirts are always a joy.  The reading is interesting and the lectures, though sometimes convoluted and requiring close attention to understand, are always interesting and informative.  And consequently, Missing a class or three or four is no big deal if you keep up the reading and make sure to attend discussion sections.  There is no final or midterm, and the frequent essay topics are interesting and fun.  \nWorkload:\nheavy reading but it's not all necessary, 3 page essay, assigned and graded by TA every 2 weeks -- no final or midterm.\n"

            "review_content": "\nOK, whoever wrote the last review has very little credibility, because if he or she had read the syllabus it would have been clear that the course was intended to do half of what was complained about. No, this class is not an ethnography of war (although there were some really interesting readings that I think qualify as ethnographies.) On the syllabus, and in class on the first day, the Professor explained that the point of the class was to explore war as a concept, the attraction/repulsion people felt towards it, and to think about meaningful ways to resist war and explore the possibilities for anti-war art (the fact that the course title uses \"war machine\" not \"war\" ought to give some of this away). I do think there's something slightly disturbing about the abstraction of war, but I think in disucssing war conceptually people were usually expressing frustration with the lack of \"reality\"war has for many of us-- and I think it trivializes the real experience of war to pretend that reading ethnography of war would resolve this. While this class doesn't deal with much straight anthropological theory ,it is very much concerned with the symbolic and with social forms and structures, and with various questions of representation. Personally I was fascinated by the way material from different disciplines and historical circumstances was tied together conceptually and made relevant to major anthropological questions. Yes, this class was more lecture than seminar, and I think Professor Taussig could have done a better job facilitating discussion, but I also think you'd be hard pressed to find a professor on this campus who could make a two hour lecture as consistantly interesting as this one was. I didn't get the impression that he was at all closed off to alternate opinions, in fact class discussion was often dominated by one or two students who had vocal opposition to the view being presented, and while people disagreed with them they were never silenced or ridiculed. My biggest complaint was the constantly changing reading assignments-- not because I'm big on sticking to the syllabus, but because on occasion we did not know what the day's reading was until the morning of class, and it got confusing. I still enjoyed the class very much, and didn't feel like the flexibility seriously detracted from it. I understand how that the lack of structure and the interdisciplinary aspects of the course might frustrate some people, but it was pretty clear what they were getting into when they enrolled in the class. So basically, if you're very conservative, or if you can't deal with uncertainty in academic settings, or you just have a big stick up your butt like the previous reviewer, stay away fromt this or any other class Taussig is teaching, but if you're ok with randomness you'll probably learn a lot. \nWorkload:\nA lot of reading, but don't go by the syllabus because you won't get to all of it. A few short (2 page) papers graded generously. Some of the topics were better than others, but overall I thought the assignments were a good way to approach the somewhat difficult reading. Also, be aware that there's an unscheduled discusson section for this class, and it adds an extra hour per week. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class sucked like no other. To call it a class is a fallacy. To call it anthropology is ridiculous. To call Taussig anything but a giant self-important self-pleasuring intellectual fallace is... well... you get the point. Taussig has no structure to his rants and his content is void of intellectual merit. He doesn't question his own cultural assumptions or those of his students, and in a discipline based on examining cultural structures, world-views, and ASSUMPTIONS, his sloppiness is unacceptable. If I as a student can poke major holes in my professor's methodology and arguments, something's not quite right. Where's the ethnographic material of people who have actually engaged in warfare? Where's the synthesis of the ridiculously stratified readings we did? What got to me most was Taussig's completely unselfconscious bias. He presents one interpretation of our reality like it's truth, and that's just bad news in a discipline that examines multiple, culturally specific \"truths.\" Taussig's got knowledge, but he has neither the perspective nor the wisdom to balance it out. And what sort of professor makes up paper topics 10 minutes after class has finished? What sort of respect does that show for students, or the subject, for that matter? This seminar made me want to vomit. My ass could have taught a better class.\nWorkload:\nBuying coffee to stay awake in class. And a few B.S. papers. EZ.\n"

He doesn't think like your average academic, he doesn't talk like your average academic...he can make Walter Benjamin, Robert Louis Stevenson William Burroughs and Shakespeare all fit into a single class, and not only that, make sense. The readings were every which way, fun, shocking, and sometimes really difficult, and the lectures are the same. I learned a lot and I enjoyed it. The problems: his classes tend to be crowded and this is one seminar where you probably won't open your mouth much. Honestly, I say, all the better: Taussig can fill a 2 hour class and every last minute will be worth your attention. He is that good, every single week.\nWorkload:\n1 3 page paper every 2 weeks. Not bad for a seminar!\n"
