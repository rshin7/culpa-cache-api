She is an absolute breath of fresh air. Take any class that she offers! She is fair and even though the material is hard she will make time to see you to clarify any doubts! The workload for this class is definitely doable though the problem sets can take a while...we have 6 this semester. Go to her office hours she's very helpful! \nI have nothing but good things to say about her...she's brilliant!!!\nWorkload:\n2 midterms. 6 Problem sets. 2 group paper presentations. Final. \n"
