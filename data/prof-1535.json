            "review_content": "\nProfessor Vogt is really, really a fantastic teacher for philosophy. We read texts (not long ones, typically easily manageable) that were complex and encompassed huge ideas, but once we discussed them in class, I think more or less everyone had a good understanding of the subject matter. Even more than that, though, we all developed our views on a topic and asked questions or criticized parts of a philosopher's theory, and Professor Vogt really encouraged that. I feel like the class has changed the way that I think, even, in that we were pushed to be very, very precise in the way we thought and spoke about topics. Obviously, in a class that revolves primarily around the meaning and usage of words like \"good\" versus \"the good\" versus \"goodness,\" that kind of thinking is key. Don't ever think that philosophy classes are just easy! Ethics is really accessible in that it deals with ideas that permeate our everyday existence, but it was challenging in the best way in that it helped me grow.\nChristine was my TA, and her recitations were great and really illuminating. Same goes for her comments on assignments. She's really sweet and makes an effort to get involved with students to answer questions and to clarify points. She was also happy to meet one-on-one to talk about how to approach a paper topic.\nI really recommend this class to anyone, not just philosophy majors. I find it hard to imagine that anyone would be wholly uninterested in thinking about morality, and Professor Vogt really knows how to teach it.\nWorkload:\nSix outlines (one page single-spaced each)\nTwo papers (one that's four pages double-spaced and another final paper that's six pages double-spaced)\nReadings for every class\n"

            "review_content": "\nI love reviews like the one below this because they remind you how useful the 'Disagree' button is in CULPA.\nProfessor Vogt was an amazing professor: sweet, funny, smart, accessible, and (in this reviewer's opinion) pretty attractive for a classicist not interested in beauty as existing in the realm of sensible things. Honestly, this is one of my favorite classes I've taken here yet. The first few days I was at a loss for what was going on, excited that I was clueless but still worried for my prospects in the class. Vogt asked the kinds of questions that you really have to think about before answering, and didn't shy away from making the class participate on her terms \u00e2\u20ac\u201d through substantive analysis and thoughtful consideration of the texts. She wanted us to read Plato on his terms, so the smart-ass philosophy majors who feel better for knocking the tangential details about classical philosophy were left speechless almost every time they tried to use 18th century rebuttals against the Man, the Legend. \nShe did a great job of guiding discussion and of engaging the large classroom so that it felt cozy. The reviewer below was correct in saying that some of the students in the class stopped participating toward the end, but the one time I came late and had to sit in the back I saw why: I was surrounded by Angry Birds and Facebook profiles \u00e2\u20ac\u201d if you're only willing to look up and pay attention between page-loads, you're bound to end up dazed and confused toward the end of a 3000-level course. Her assignments were clear and the she usually did well to pick topics for the one-page assignments that weren't overwhelming while picking topics for the longer papers that invited in-depth analysis. \nSeveral of the papers I wrote went against her approach to the dialogues; not only was I not penalized for having an opposing opinion, but I honestly feel I was graded more generously for being willing to think beyond class discussion in my essays.\nAlso, a note about my TA for Plato, Andreas Avgousti. This man is brilliant and affable. He was always available for office hours and before and after class \u00e2\u20ac\u201d I saw him stay with a student for half an hour after class once and go over her paper in detail to show her were she did well and where she could use work. He was always willing to walk with me and discuss things tangentially relevant to the text and he gave detailed reviews that explained exactly why I earned the grade he gave me \u00e2\u20ac\u201d no higher, no lower. Having him as my TA felt like I had been given my own personal professor and I never felt at a loss when going to him for clarification instead of Professor Vogt.\nWorkload:\nFour one-page essays, two six-page essays (though the second one was shortened down to four pages in sympathy for finals stress), each focusing on a specific dialogue and offering two or more topics \u00e2\u20ac\u201d you could also pick your own if you ran it by your TA and Professor Vogt first. A mid-term wherein you picked three topics to write a blue book entry on, out of 6 offered, from a collection of 15 that she sent out a week ahead of time \u00e2\u20ac\u201d easy A if you can make the time to study the questions on the review.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Vogt is a truly intelligent instructor who clearly commits a great deal of her time and energy to teaching undergraduates. That said, one should be prepared for a very tedious work load, and a teaching style that can frequently be infuriating especially at the end of a semester. Having had a year of professor Vogt (I took Ethics, which is called moral philosophy here, in the fall of 2010 and Plato in 2011), I will break down my experience based on class because I am of the opinion that her Ethics class is a lot better than the Plato class.\nEthics:\nThis class was a great way to get a good introduction to the major ethical systems which have influenced the Western world to date. You survey Mill's Utilitarianism, Kant's Groundwork, and Aristotle's Ethics. You also (and this is really a nice touch that I feel like many would not get if taking this class at another school or with another professor) read contemporary philosophers and get their thoughts about these three ethical systems. This all happens in the first half of the course and culminates in a midterm where you have to explain a certain number of passages from these philosophers and the contemporaries who comment on them. The second half of the semester is all focused on examining current ethicists in a field which professor Vogt calls meta-ethics (a topic I feel is very poorly defined). This is where the class became more frustrating because she began to solicit more student participation. When explaining an argument or an idea, Professor Vogt is great. She has a great way of distilling complex sentences and passages into understandable arguments both in class and on her outlines (which she posts right before each class). However, Professor Vogt is also obsessed with soliciting student participation. This would be fine if she was good at leading discussion and guiding the class towards the right answer, but she's not. Any time professor Vogt poses a question to the class, the discussion immediately grows unfocused to the point where I, at least, had a difficult time understanding what I was supposed to take from the discussion. Professor Vogt never concludes these discussions with any sort of thought but rather just proceeds to the next point, leave me puzzled and frustrated.  The frequency of the discussion at the end of the semester made her classes literally worthless. As the difficulty of the texts we read went up (modern philosophy is a lot harder than it looks), the time professor Vogt spent on explaining them went down! Soliciting student particiaption is good and all, but I signed up for this class to learn the thoughts of other, smarter people, not just throw ideas out at the professor and see what sticks.  So, while the class frequently became frustrating, the workload similarly was irksome. In addition to the midterm described above, there were two 6-8 page papers on topics that we had to come up with ourselves (a nice change from most philosophy papers) and 10, 1-page outlines that we had to do over the course of the semester. The papers were fine, but the outlines were frustrating because they forced you to do professor Vogt's job for her. If you could successfully outline a philosopher's argument and get a 100 on the outline, there was no point to going to class that day since you already understood the text. The idea of outlines is great, knowing how to do one is essential to one's success as a philosopher, but to grade them on a 1-100 scale I think misses the point of such an assignment. That said, the class was incredibly easy, 50% of the students got either A's or A-'s (as confirmed by my transcript) so don't freak out about this class being to difficult for you because it's not.\nPlato:\nAgain, the first half of the course is a good rundown of the major Platonic texts that you would get in almost any other survey. During this first half, again, professor Vogt does a good job staying on topic, explaining important arguments, and really explicating these texts. The first half of the semester culminates in a midterm much like the ethics midterm. The second half, just like Ethics, contains much more challenging material, but also contained just as much frustrating and useless discussion. I learned nothing because professor Vogt refused to teach and instead asked us questions to which she never gave any guidance.\nIt is important to say here that, in both classes, there are about 10-15 people who pack the front rows and manage to stay engaged throughout the entire semester despite the lack of concrete solutions or explanations of the texts. They will surely object to this review. I encourage them to look behind them and see how many people are no longer paying attention (or just not in class) because professor Vogt cannot keep the class organized enough to make any compelling or interesting points.\nWorkload:\nEthics:\n10 outlines (dropped from the original 12 that was planned and which you will see on the syllabus) due at your own pace (read: do them early) throughout the semester, 2 6-8 papers of topics you make up for yourself, midterm. 50% got some form of A's\nPlato:\n3 1-page papers on topics given to you and due throughout the semester, 2 6-8 page papers on near the midterm, one near the end, midterm.\n"

Though the reading can be challenging, Professor Vogt prepares notes over every reading and puts them on courseworks before class, which makes things much easier. Class time is divided between clarifying texts and discussing their implications, with more emphasis on the latter. Professor Vogt is excellent at answering questions and addressing comments, which really encourages participation. She has the very rare ability to make a large lecture at times fell like a discussion. \nWorkload:\nA lot of difficult readings, 10 one-page outlines over the readings (you can pick which ones), midterm, two 6-page papers.

At the beginning - I guess some of the previous culpa reviews had made me biased -  I was very skeptical, and there were moments were I was a bit put off by her abruptness, but in retrospect, that was all so that she could go through as much of the assigned material as clearly as she can, so that we really can understand and therefore appreciate it all. What's great about Vogt is that she makes lecture notes for class - with that said, you always do get more out of the lectures by attending as well - but that means that there's nothing left uncovered. If we can't discuss it in class, the main points she would have wanted to highlight would be on the lecture notes on courseworks, and those are really helpful when studying for the exams as well.\nShe's very approachable and open to questions - if she ever cuts you off, it's only in interest of time, which is understandable, but you can tell that, if she were given the choice, she could go on and on about arguments because she just loves philosophy so much. Not to mention, she does help a great deal in making difficult concepts very (to use Descartes' term) clear and distinct. I definitely recommend her. She's teaching Moral Philosophy next semester and I can't wait to take it with her!\nWorkload:\nThree short, one page papers that are like 'close readings' of an excerpt from what we've covered in class. One longer paper that is about three to five pages, which was between the midterm and the final.\nThe final is only material covered after the midterm, so it's basically like a 'second midterm' or whatever. The exams are really straightforward. They're close analyses of passages from each philosopher covered, which she gives us beforehand. She'll give us four Plato passages, for example, and then on the exam, for the \"Plato question\", two of the four previously provided will be on, and you choose one - that sort of thing.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI'm pretty sure the reviewer before me must have been one of the quieter ones in class, because I clearly did not witness Prof. Vogt shooting down any points directly - in fact, her moving on from those points was essentially a polite manner of not embarrassing you by telling you how far off from the mark you were. Alot of my points were certainly glossed over in discussion which just prompted me to think about saying something that might catch her attention. \nShe was a refreshing breath of air in the Core classes I've taken so far in her expert ability to TEACH. She knows the texts at the back of her hand and TELLS you where the key points to understanding the work are. This already makes the course easy, as opposed to other instructors (believe me, there are many) who would conduct a free flow discussion with ideas that may not end up with any substantial conclusion. Yes - CC is about teaching us how to interpret and apply the concepts that have shaped the Western world, but it should not be about a debate of, \"oh what do you think Augustine said?\" Rather, it should be \"do you think what Augustine said was important?\" \nAnd Prof. Vogt clearly teaches you about the second question.\nAbout attendance, when I read the general review that said Prof. Vogt missed class alot, I was astonished. It gave me the impression that she wasn't in class half the time. Truthfully, she rescheduled 2 lessons in the entire semester, that unfortunately due to the collective schedule of the class had to be made up on Fridays. Even for those who could not make it for the make-ups, she held SECOND make-up sessions so that those who missed it wouldn't fall behind. Plus, she was at so much pains to make sure that the make up could be attended by as many students as possible. \nApproachability: I'm not a big fan of office hours, but I did visit once after the midterms to review my performance and Prof. Vogt really didn't have much time to give me the aid I needed. Still, she's always reachable by email, especially in the earlier part of the semester.\nIf you're in this section - LUCKY.\nWorkload:\nLighter than most sections, no more than an average of 40-45 pages of reading per class. Prof. Vogt always attempts to pass off her grading as lenient, but I think her standards got higher throughout the semester. \n"

True, she answers too many questions, but it's the students' fault for asking so many stupid questions that really could be answered by reading the texts.

Prof. Vogt is incredibly passionate about her subject and rather than give a broad overview, from which one learns nothing, she chooses to delve into specific arguments in great detail.  The virtue of this is that you get a real understanding of the kind of questions that philosophers, and scholars of philosophy, obsess over.  You will also walk away with knowledge that will last.  I don't even know Aristotle's dates but I know what he thinks the purpose of human life is, and to me that seems much more important.  \nProf. Vogt's lectures were, for the most part, very clear and organized, and when she did go off on a tangent it was usually interesting.  She also does a good job with questions, giving thorough answers to good ones and this cute \"what the *!@# are you talking about\" look to the stupid ones. When there are certain points that she wants everyone to get she will repeat herself, and it may seem like she is just being repetitive, but if you really pay attention you will find that each time she explains it she is adding some nuance.

If a student nails a question, she gets very excited and never tells a student that he/she is wrong.  Sometimes she says, \"Well, I've never heard that before, but let's see what (place name here) thinks about it.\"  It is an amazing class.  There can not be a better lit hum teacher.  If you love knowledge, then you want Katja as your proffesor as she has a ton.  Trust me on this.\nWorkload:\n3 essays.  2 short 1200-1500 and 1 essay 1800-2200.  Mid term is easy and she prepares you very well for it.  Final is also very fair and students all get A's or high B's depending on whether they read or not.\n"

She really knows her stuff and can get enthusiastic about it.  She listens to what everyone has to say and then gives her opinion of what we need to know.  The class is really not hard at all.   She is a fair grader and not very harsh.  She is a pretty good lecturer but sometimes it can drag a little if the class hasn't done the reading, and a lot of the time you really don't have to do the reading.  She is also very approachable in e-mail or even in a break during class if you have a question or a problem.  One thing that will definately put you in her good graces is PARTICIPATION IN CLASS.\nWorkload:\n3 papers about 1500-2000 words each.  E-classes (meaning emailed answers to discussion questions) when she has to cancel class.  Standard Lit Hum reading load. Midterm was easy because you just have to follow the review in class and she goes over what will be on it and just pay attention to whatever quotes she says are important from the particular work you are reading. \nStandard course-wide Final.\n"

I will admit that she is very smart and is ALWAYS prepared and leads good discussions.  HOWEVER, I found her grading to be very arbitrary and unfair.  I worked very hard in her class, I did all the reading, actively participated in class, and wrote (what I considered) excellent essays, but felt as though I was always borderline no matter how hard I tried.  It seems like kids with philosophical backgrounds that could earn brownie points in discussions and essays by incorporating far fetched connections to some loosely connected philosophical works prospered in her class.  For those of you who don't fit that category, but work hard and expect results from the hard work that you put in then I would recommend you take a different section.\nWorkload:\nnormal reading load with a couple extra handouts (nothing too bad), normal essays (graded harshly), tough midterm (graded even harder than the essays), easy final.  Second semester grading toughens\n"

While it is true that she is an easy grader and that she has no interest to instigate dynamic discussion, she is above all an extremely passionate thinker with a true commitment to teaching the books. She is rather young in her deparment and hence she questions a lot of established ideas that have formed around the books. \nEssentially, she gives what she receives.. In days when the class had obviously read the material she was passionate and brilliantly elucidated the texts, during some lessons when nobody  had done the reading she tried to focus on what everybody read to avoid embarassing us. She is very shy, but also very approachable through e-mail and office hours.  \nBasically  - a very profound professor. If you set aside your need to be \"entertained\" she will provide a great lit hum experience \nWorkload:\nthree papers - two short, one long one, midterm, final. \n"

Of course, I'd take a class with her again (I'd love to have had her for CC), but I wouldn't expect to get very stressed out.\nWorkload:\nthe Lit Hum special - 2 3-5 page papers, a midterm, a final.

For some reason, and I'm not sure exactly why, I always wanted to hear every detail and anecdote she offerred.\n    The one shortcoming of the class is that she seemed to take as many questions as we could throw at her and would never cut a student off regardless of how inconsequentlal or lengthy his tirade was. Some might think this a good thing; however, pausing in her lecture to hear students babble is like pausing the Nightly News Hour  to watch the O'Reilly factor: always jarring and often unpleasant.\nWorkload:\n2 short papers (1500 words), 2 1-page papers, midterm and final.\n"
