            "review_content": "\nU.S. Intellectual History was a super interesting class. As a history major, I've done a lot of history, but I'd never really looked at the history of ideas as they flowed through the events that happened, so it gave me a cool new perspective on why things in post-Civil War American history happened the way they did.\nCasey Blake is a great professor. He really knows what he's talking about, and always made a point to include interesting little things in lecture to keep the class alive (as--and he admitted this himself--it could get a little dry sometimes). He was also really kind and helpful in office hours, interested in helping students refine paper topics and re-explaining topics from lecture.\nThe readings in this class did get a little long and were sometimes kind of dry, but the only way you could succeed in this class was by actually sitting down and doing them. If you hadn't done the readings, you weren't able to follow what was happening in lecture, and you also looked like an idiot in section (where, because they were so small in size, it was impossible to fly under the radar). But actually getting through all of them did, in the end, make me a better and more educated person.\nThe TAs were REALLY nitpicky when it came to writing, and would count you down on both papers and exams for spelling/grammar errors, structure, and word choice as well as ideas. This could be really annoying, but since it happened to 99% of people, it was pretty much fine in the end.\nWorkload:\n50-150 pages of reading per class (varied by week)\n2 papers (5-7 pages)\n1 grammar quiz (multiple choice)\nMidterm\nFinal\n"

            "review_content": "\nCasey Blake is just really really smart. Other reviewers have observed that he's not an extremely enthusiastic lecturer, and although this is kind of accurate, he is definitely passionate, and this makes him a very compelling lecturer. He is just so extraordinarily knowledgeable. The course is taught along with Professor Spiegel, with the intention that he covers more of the history side and Professor Spiegel does more of the film and literary analysis, but I found that Professor Blake's commentary on the books and movies were often more brilliant than Prof Spiegel's. \nIntro to American Studies is truly unlike any other class, simply because it engages with so many mediums. One week, we will divide class time between a history lesson and a discussion of a film from the time period, and the next week, we will spend the entirety of both classes discussing a novel we read. At times this class is a history class, at times it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a literature class, and at times it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a film class. And walking into class, I would never know which one I was going to get that day. I would like to tell you that all these different mediums came together seamlessly, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not the case. To be honest, the class just wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very consistent. At times it was my favorite class. Really. During some classes, I would just sit there thinking, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love this. This is the best class ever.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Other times, however, it was just really unorganized. \nMy biggest complaint about this class is that all of the assignments are film and literary analysis. Though a lot of class time is devoted to American History, it is possible to excel in this class without knowing a single thing about anything historical. I wish the assignments forced us to engage more with the historical context of the books and movies we consumed. My favorite thing about this class is that the books we read and the movies we watched were really exceptional. The syllabus is truly fantastic, and it's the reason I really enjoyed this course. \n\nWorkload:\nPretty much one book and one movie every week. It is definitely not necessary to read all of the books, but I would recommend seeing all the movies. Three 5-7 page papers, easy final. \n"

If you're not a history major and want an accessible course to learn some awesome American history, and a sense of the discipline from an inspiring professor, this is my highest recommendation. If you are a history major, this is one of the best lectures in the department. \nProfessor Blake is not especially dynamic, but his lectures are extremely well organized, and his passion for the material comes through. He is well loved by the graduate students, and so seems to always get the best ones to TA the class. \nIn terms of course material, the only clunker is the first week's assignment, which is uncharacteristically long and boring. Otherwise there is a surprisingly light reading load, which actually compelled me to seek out more material from the intellectuals we read because it was so fantastic. \nWorkload:\nVery light reading for a history class, two completely manageable essays, midterm and final which include CC-style passage identifications (tedious but doable). Weekly courseworks postings. \n"

            "review_content": "\nThe other reviews saying this man is uninspired are absolutely correct. He teaches the material without enthusiasm and as though he is merely summarizing what he feels is common knowledge. The course, on another note, did not reach the present... it didn't even reach 1970 and he made no comments about this at all. This course was a bore and the TAs graded harshly. The readings assigned each week were difficult and numerous and discussion section thoroughly unenlightening--the TA I had didn't study American history and had could add little to the students' discussion. Don't take this class unless you want to be mystified by complex readings, which are not explained and then be graded cruelly by uninformed TAs. The final paper is also a complete killer because it is supposed to be based upon readings not gone over in class or discussion section and current events, which are also not discussed. \nWorkload:\nToo many readings. Midterm, final and final paper. \n"

It took a little while to get used to Blake's lecturing style, since he talks a bit like Woody Allen and sort of stares at a point on the back of the room about 10 feet over all our heads.  That being said, he's brilliant--he speaks eloquently and insightfully for 75 minutes, making great connections between thinkers and eras (while we all scrambled to write down every word he said).  \nI was lucky enough to take this class during the election year, and he did a great job incorporating that material.  We spent an entire class talking about the election on the day afterwards, and our term paper assignment was to read John Dewey and Walter Lippmann's theories of democracy and discuss an aspect of the election through the lens of their ideas.  Very relevant, since the whole point of intellectual history is to learn about past thinkers' ideas and apply them to modern contexts. \nAlso, I don't know what other reviewers are talking about with the grading issues, since about half the class got some kind of an A.  I can't see how that constitutes some kind of harsh curve--it seems pretty standard for Columbia history classes.\nOverall, this is a can't-miss course for any history major, or really, any American.  You study the greatest thinkers in American history, and you learn why our culture thinks the way it does/believes the things it does.  Totally awesome.\n(I don't know whether TAs will repeat for this class, but ours were James Chappel, Thomas Meaney, and Tamara Mann, and they were all great.)\nWorkload:\nModerate.  Significant reading (not always long, though sometimes very dense, but the TAs make it clear what the core texts are) and weekly paragraph-long Courseworks postings on those readings.  8-10 page final paper, plus midterm/final. \n"

I don't how other reviewers could categorize Blake as mediocre-- they probably weren't paying attention in the lectures.  He speaks on a very high, often philosophical level that can sometimes be hard to follow if you're dozing off.  In terms of the subject material, it's fascinating. Basically a history of American ideas pertaining to a host of different areas, from the debate over Darwinism to the 60s and seeds of the neo-conservative movement. As other reviewers have already pointed out, the readings are great, but so is Blake!\nWorkload:\nWhat the other reviews allude to is correct-- there is definitely a curve in this class that does not exist in most other history classes, so beware.

The reading list, though long, was great!  You need to do the readings because he tests both on class notes and readings but they are worth doing.  Some of them are dense but most are fairly easy to plow through.   Blake was approachable after class and during office hours.

            "review_content": "\nUnfortunately, this is one of the most brilliant courses as far as reading materials go (if you like following intellectual trends over time) with a very mediocre profesor.  He spent a decent amount of time telling us personal biography about authors and others but, if you didn't already have a fair knowledge of the historical context the pieces were written in, he didn't really offer it.  The point of view of the reading and the trends focused are on were really one sided so, again, if you didn't already have a fair knowledge of American History, this course does nothing to complicate difficult arguements.  It felt a tad like a highschool course in more ways than one...Also, he seems like one of those professors who has a very clear expectation of what he expects to see from you in terms of essays but no ability to communicate that to you.  He definitely isn't a horrible professor (even if not to my liking).  But, honestly, it felt like you would get a whole lot more by taking a normal American history course and just doing the reading for this course some other time.  I don't want to sound to harsh, this is meant to be lukewarm, but you definitely get the feeling this guy stopped finding his job interesting a long time ago.  \nWorkload:\nNormal for a history course.\n"

As evidence of its questionable veracity, I point to the following.  First, it is way to effusive, and offers its praise by listing the entire sylabus, correctly spelled, in order.  Second, it is clearly a response to the earlier posting which charges that Blake curves the class (which, trust me, he does).  Third, the author claims to know that the class isn't curved.  Fourth, there is way too much praise all around about Blake and the sylabus of the class.  Fifth, look at the detailed description of the workload.  Who would bother?\nI took this class.  The readings are good.  Blake is mediocre, an ok speaker, but thoroughly uninspired.  It's true, you will not be graded solely on your work, there is a curve.\nIf you need this class, take it, but be warned.  If you don't need it, don't take, and don't study with Blake.\nWorkload:\nAverage.  Mid-term.  Final.  Two short papers.\n"

            "review_content": "\nPersonally, I agree with the reviewer who starts his posting by declaring that \"Casey Blake might be thought of as one of the best History professors at Columbia.\"  Blake presented some of the most interesting and insightful lectures in my 3 years here at Columbia.  Topics of this course included the crumbling of the Genteel Tradition in post-Civil War America, the revolt against Victorianism, pragmatism and the shift to progressivism and cosmopolitanism, as well as intellectual responses to World Wars I and II.  Blake also spent time discussing the rise and fall of American communism, total war and \"radical evil,\" as well as Cold War liberalism, the civil rights movement, and neoconservatism.  Blake's lectures were filled with a tremendous amount of information, however, he organizes the material in a very neat, orderly way so that central themes and events that are raised within the course connect to one another seemlessly.  \nAfter reading some of the past reviews, I feel the need to defend Professor Blake.  I had Courtney Fullilove as a TA and I know (from speaking to other students) that a few people in my section received A's and A-'s, so personally I do not hold any stock in the rumor that some sort of negative curve was implemented by section.  What I believe happened is that students who did not bother to take thorough notes or read the assigned material cornered a TA, demanding to know why their grade wasn't higher.  What would anyone say in answer to that sort of crude question . . . you weren't worthy of a higher grade?  No, the TA probably took the nicer way out and blamed the grade on some imaginary negative curve.  To do well in this class, all you need to do is read the material, participate in recitation, and take detailed notes.  Notes are essential because Blake bases ID sections on the midterm and final on terms which can only be found in lecture.  \nAnyone who wants a thorough knowledge of American history needs to take this course with this excellent professor.  If anyone has doubts, just go to the first few lectures and hear Blake for yourself.  If you take notes and do the reading, you won't be disappointed (and you might even be able to spell the names of major players as well as themes of the course correctly).\nWorkload:\nTwo 5-7 page papers with very interesting topics, weekly recitation sections, moderate weekly reading, fair midterm, fair final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nCasey Blake might be thought of as one of the best History professors at Columbia, were he to deign to teach undergraduates more often. I would often fill five or more pages with highly detailed notes, furiously attempting to pack in the extraordinary volume of information eloquently woven into the fabric of Blake's fluid, fast-paced lectures. Rarely would he ever have to stop to switch gears; every subject change was deftly accompanied by a brilliant segue. Even if the course often fell behind the prescriptions of the syllabus, Professor Blake could extemporaneously rearrange its elements as if they were originally intended to be presented as a united concept. He was also capable of delivering the occasional extraordinarily witty or hilarious quip, often of only the most skillful subtlety. The drama of such flighty, inspiring lectures often left one panting, breathless, and eager to return to hear what would follow the ominous portents or hopeful previews often rounding off each class. In addition, the class was treated to two excellent films (Arguing the World, about the New York intellectuals going their separate ideological ways from their City College roots, and the Fog of War, a documentary on the career of Robert McNamara) and a sweep of extraordinary readings, including several novels, autobiographical works, philosophical treatises, political polemics, and stirring examples of expository prose- you will read such giants as William James, John Dewey, Walter Lippmann, Jane Addams, Randolph Bourne, HL Mencken, Richard Wright, Reinhold Niebuhr, Hannah Arendt, Noam Chomsky, James Baldwin, and more. Often these are packaged into taughtly but elegantly summarized passages in the course reader, and in cases in which full books are assigned, they are only of the highest quality and truly deserving of your time. The TAs were for the most part excellent and section was a surprisingly engaging and illuminating experience. If you have any interest in the philosophical trends and ideas which have shaped the fabric of the United States since the Civil War, or merely want to hear how exemplary a lecture can be, this is the course to take. \nWorkload:\nTwo 5-7 page papers, one comparing three philosophical texts, the other taking the ideas presented in the film \"Fog of War\" and juxtaposing them to the philosophies of postwar intellectuals. Midterm and final, very standard. Reading is low-moderate. Contrary to the claims of a previous reviewer, quite a few people did well in the course, and there was hardly any \"reverse curve\" applied in the end, despite rumors of its implementation. \n"

It seems Blake has his TA's give out only one 'A' per section, only one 'A-' and the rest are clustered around the B's to C's.  So, if you end up in a section with jocks, you're fine.  If, however, you end up like I did, in a section with four of the smartest kids in the class, you get slaughtered.  My TA confessed that Blake had the TAs grade things down to fit the curve and he admitted to feeling bad about adjusting grades downard to fit Blake's curve. Take this on my authority, plus that of five students in the class, in additon to my TA.  That said, the class is ok-to-good.  Blake is a fine professor.

I personally think that one of his best assets as a teacher is his ability to take broad topics about American history and organize them into smaller, more manageable units that allow his students to explore a particular topic in-depth while also learning overarching themes that can be applied to other areas. Prof. Blake is enthusiastic about a wide variety of forms of cultural expression, and likes to integrate media studies, art history, film, history, politics, and sociology into his lessons. Another plus is his willingness (and even eagerness) to hear what his students have to say. He encourages lots of class participation, and naturally expects that his students have devoted considerable time and attention to their readings and papers. \nWorkload:\nInteresting readings, papers, class participation and attendence. \n"
