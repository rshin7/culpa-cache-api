            "review_content": "\nCliff\u2019s class was overall a solid, low workload course. While I don\u2019t find Production Scheduling an inherently exciting topic, I think Cliff did a good job of trying to keep everyone engaged.\nThroughout the class you simply look at different scenarios and consider the best ways to schedule things to meet certain objectives. The provided textbook is quite awful, and Cliff\u2019s slides are quite bare, so you will definitely want to go to class.He mostly uses the white board in class, and uses the slides just to remind himself of the example he is about to work through. That being said, he is good at providing the intuition of how to approach the various problems, and is surprisingly good at providing a silly metaphor to help you think through the logic (e.g: \u201cif we are running a race, and you are both faster and start closer to the finish line, it is obvious who will win\u201d). \nHe is also very aware that this class in in senior spring for most students, so he spent some time talking about job stuff, Columbia\u2019s basketball team, etc. \nHis exams aren\u2019t super difficult, but they also are not boringly algorithmic. He isn\u2019t just going to give you a type of problem you have seen and ask you to apply the algorithm found in class. That might be part of the problem but then he might modify an assumption or ask a more conceptual question, so you will have to synthesize learning from other algorithms to make a slight modification to the one at hand. This shouldn\u2019t be difficult or shocking for anyone, but I guess it is slightly annoying for those in senior spring who would rather just chill out. \nHe has 1 homework set a week that is not particularly difficult, and usually taken less than 3 hours to do, if not less. There is a final project for this class but you define the scope of it, so to some extent, it is as much work as you want it to be, subject to limitations of course. Overall this is a somewhat boring topic, presented in a clear way, by a good professor with a low workload. \n\nWorkload:\nWeekly homework, 15%\n1 midterm, 30%\n1 final project, 20%\n1 final exam, 35%\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis was definitely one of the best, most rewarding classes I've taken at Columbia.  \nWhile the huge size of the class was definitely not optimal, Stein has mastered the art of teaching a large class.  The class definitely covers a lot of dense material, but the instructor did a great job picking out the important ideas without getting bogged down and trying to cover every last line of the textbook.  He's without question one of the best lecturers I've had at this school.  I know that often taking a class from the author of the textbook can mean that lecture notes seem like copies of the textbook, but that is not the case in this class.  I found his presentation a bit friendlier and more streamlines than the book, and he was also quite funny and brought great energy to the class.  The book could be terse, but it was definitely helpful to refer to after lectures for more details.\nAs people have mentioned previously, the workload is intense.  Each of the seven homework assignments are incredibly long.  I don't think I've ever spent so much time on homework assignments for a class.  I learned a ton from completing them, but they definitely could've been a bit shorter without compromising much value.  With that in mind, this is definitely not a class to undertake lightly.\nThe exams were much more straightforward than the assignments, and if you put a lot of effort into the assignments, it would be reflected on the exams.  It was very frustrating that so many people cheated on homework assignments for perfect scores.  I don't really have a good answer to this, as I too was very frustrated by it.  Seeing as this happened, giving a take home midterm might not have been the best idea.  The grading seemed fair to generous, especially for undergrads who were curved separately.\n\nWorkload:\nExtremely heavy workload.  7 massive homework assignments worth 30% of the grade, and a take home midterm and in class final each worth 35% of the grade.\n"

            "review_content": "\nFirst off I enjoyed the course and think Prof. Stein is an excellent teacher. His lectures do a good job of explaining some very dense material and he also is engaging and manages to keep a relatively light tone despite the large class size. He seems well prepared and obviously is a master of the material. Sometimes when you take a course where the teacher is also the textbook author you might as well just stay home and read the book; however with this class Prof. Stein manages to add a lot of value despite covering mostly similar material to the book. The book itself is pretty good too although occasionally too terse.\nThe material itself is critical to any advanced CS study - either research or advanced development - and so I would recommend it to anyone looking at or already in grad school or who wants to get a highly competitive job at a top company. That said, if all you want to do is get a decent entry level CS job this material is more challenging than what you need to know.\nSpeaking of challenging material the class is VERY hard. Primarily this is due to the HW. With one or two exceptions each of the seven problem sets is extremely long and difficult. And (as has been pointed out) cheating is rampant. If you want to get the mean or better without cheating be prepared to invest at least twenty hours on each HW.\nI actually thought the midterm was great. Since the questions were brand new you couldn't cheat from the internet and so I felt the long hours I put into it were rewarded with a good score above the mean. This is in contrast to the HWs where no matter how hard I worked I generally got an average grade.\nI also thought the questions on the final were fair although I was surprised at my grade (which wasn't bad but wasn't good either). C'est la vie, you can't win them all. Certainly the questions on both the midterm and final are easier than on the HWs.\nOverall I loved the class although I think it would be even better if they reduced the amount of HW and used easier questions written from scratch each semester so people couldn't cheat from the internet. I do understand this would be a lot of work for the staff. As it stands right now hard work on the problem sets will help you learn the material very well, but can be frustrating due to sheer volume and the fact many people cheat/collaborate.\nCurve seemed fair to me but I haven't discussed grades with anyone else in the class. Overall TAs seemed pretty good. Some logistical hiccups (not nearly enough seats in lecture hall, HWs returned via huge pile/mad rush method) but generally grading was quick. Feedback on Piazza questions a bit skimpy but not bad.\nTL;DR - really enjoyed the class overall, particularly the rigorous material and good lectures. Prof is high quality. Have mixed feelings regarding the huge HWs. Textbook is relatively good.\nWorkload:\nExtremely high primarily due to HW. 7 HW problem sets (30% total), one of these is half size but the others are all pretty brutal. Very fair take home midterm and fair in class final (35% each).\n"

            "review_content": "\nI agree with the previous reviewer on almost every account.  I just want to elaborate on how some of the administrative details.  I ultimately really enjoyed the course and learned a ton.  That being said, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hesitant to recommend it to anyone who is taking it just because someone told them it might be a good idea.  The workload is too heavy to undertake the course out of casual interest.\nUnfortunately, with an enormous class size, the course had a heavy focus on evaluation without much benefit.  The class had all the symptoms of a cash cow class for the master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s program.  For the whole semester (except on days when homework was due), there were students filling every seat plus the stairs of the room.  The first time homework was handed back at the front of NWCB 501, the entire class fought like idiots around the tables to get their papers as quickly as possible.  Eventually, I realized that getting my homework back was pointless, as each problem rarely had any information other than the score I got on the problem.  If the score was something in between full score and no credit, they often wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even bother to underline or cross out the mistake.  This is a great way to give grades really quickly, but not much else.  These problems extended to both the assignments and the exams.\nThe professor gave a speech on the first day about the academic honesty policy, and how using the internet to help us with the homework is not allowed.  He said that violations would be treated harshly, and that there are no exceptions this policy.  He even implemented a policy to encourage us not to waste time writing anything for problems we did not know how to solve, which was to award 3 points out of 10 for leaving the problem blank.  That all seemed fine on the first day, until you realized that nobody gave a fuck and they were all just gunning for perfect scores, regardless of how they attained them.  The bottom line is that any incentives to prevent cheating were completely unsuccessful.  Yes, people who were honest were inevitably penalized. \nThe fact that such excessive amounts of this took place makes me question whether the expectations for the class were unreasonable.  I think most people thought to some extent that the workload was too heavy.  I think the workload did detract from learning for many students.  Yes, this is a class where doing the homework requires significant insight beyond what is presented in the lectures; this is a good thing to a certain extent but sometimes it went overboard.\nUnfortunately, the exams didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily do a good job normalizing for who was most sincere in their homework assignments.  I've been in classes before where people who cheated on the homework got killed on the exams; this was not one of those classes.  The main reason for this was that the midterm was take home (and obviously everyone collaborated).  This exam was a great deal easier than the homework assignments, but the expectations are generally a rather unclear, and the grading was much harsher than homework assignments.  Also, many of the more difficult theoretical problems did not really have anything to do with the exams.  Basically, the problem sets were so extensive that the exams weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t representative of how well students understood the assignments.  For example, much of the beginning of the course and the first two homework assignments are devoted to developing mathematical techniques, but none of this comes out on the exam.\nFinally, I think there should be some coordination between this class and data structures.  To put it bluntly, data structures here is a complete joke.  I think every undergrad in the class could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve benefitted from some attention to the more advanced data structures.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying this because the background was necessary or even helpful for the material we covered.\nWorkload:\n30% Homework Assignments (7) - Difficulty and length varied substantially from week to week.  Don't be fooled by the small number of assignments.  Overall, these were some of the longest homework assignments of my life.  Some of the problems were really great and I enjoyed working through a lot of them, but it definitely was excessive.\n35% Take home midterm - This was 3 problems that was generally easier than the problems on homework assignments, but some of the expectations were very unclear.  For example, when we were told to give an efficient algorithm, there was one case where the most efficient algorithm was Dijkstra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s algorithm.  We hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t covered Dijkstra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s algorithm yet and it was on the syllabus for a later date.  That being said, I think every CS major knows about Dijkstra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s algorithm.  The truth (according to the solutions) was we were expected to use a less efficient algorithm than Dijkstra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s algorithm because it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been covered.  These types of ambiguities weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a factor in the homework assignments because they usually indicated the runtime of the algorithm we were supposed to devise.  Also (perhaps due to unclear expectations) the grading was harsh.  The average was a 45/60 and the median was a 47/60.  \n35% In-Class Final - A bit of a crapshoot, and completely impossible to prepare for.  The average was a 39/60, unsurprisingly the lowest average of the semester because it was the only in class exam.  The problem with the exams wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that they were unfair so much as if you made one wrong assumption about a problem, this made it incredibly easy to mess up.  \n"

The book is very good and the teacher, who helped write it, is very good at describing the chapters intuitively.\n2. The class covers a lot of material and, as a person without much of a background in CS theory, I really learned a lot.\n3. This class really gets intimate with the particulars of certain algorithms and you leave the class with a sense of what works where and why. At least I did, anyway. The problem sets you will be solving reinforce this way of thinking, as many problems ask you to devise an algorithm and you will get a lot of practice of what \"pieces\" to use in the \"puzzle\".\nJust about any CS concentration will find something to use from this course and in general just provides some good information.\nThere are still problems with this class:\nFirst of all, it seemed like everybody was cheating. The average on every assignment was always absurdly high and, given the challenging nature of the problem sets, seemed too good to be true. It was almost as if the people who did the work honestly were punished for doing so. No less than six times in class did I witness a student in front of me pulling up the solutions on his/her laptop. The same problem extended to the midterm because it was take home. You weren't supposed to collaborate but people did anyway. Seriously, Google \"CLRS 3rd edition solution manual\" and let me know what you find in the first result on the first page.\nWorkload:\nReally heavy. The homeworks are HARD and will take you a lot of time. Don't make the mistake I made and mix this class with other heavy classes (OS, Animation, etc)\n"

It was refreshing to finally have a professor who didn't take crap and required a homework due at the beginning of class with no exceptions.  I think it says something about the mentality of the students that couldn't accept this.\nStein lectures very well, somewhat quickly, but the material is simple so it's okay.  He has a very quirky humor.  Grading isn't overly strict, but no completion grades.\nWorkload:\nWeekly homework.  Midterm and Final aren't hard.  No group projects, thank god.\n"

Some students found that the fact that Prof. Stein, the T.A.'s, and the book all did the problems a little differently confusing, but I like that I could choose the method I was most comfortable with.  Although I feel this course would have been a much happier experience if Prof. Stien got over himself, the course itself was great.\nWorkload:\nP-Sets can be a little long, tough, and tedious, but they are definitly doable.  Exams are not bad at all.\n"

While he may speak English fluently, he races through the material and does everything differently to the book.  He schedules his office hours early in the morning, so that nobody shows and if you do show, he doesn't really help you much.  The sad part is, you will not get a choice of professors for this class, so you are stuck with him.  Best advice I can give, is start the hw early and use the TAs.\nWorkload:\nTough weekly homeworks, 2 midterms, cumulative final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Stein could just be a massive relief: after so many classes with professors who barely speak english, or who simply should never have entered the teaching profession, Stein is the kind of professor you would expect.  Not spectacular, but certainly competent.  Stein is quite prepared, and treats the teaching of the class seriously with extensive examples and preparation.  \nStein personally seems to be annoyed with students.  But you get the feeling that if you needed his help on a real academic question, he would answer; he did not take well to the usual bullshit students give professors, such as showing up late, homework nonsense and the like.\nAs for the course itself, mathematical programming is the study of optimization: you have an objective such as profit, subject to sets of constraints.  Certain topics, such as the simplex method, are quite useful, but the course is about as immediately useful as the undergrad IEOR major in general (read, not). get a phd.\n\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets, which can be long if you haven't done the reading.  Weekly recitation sections are supposedly mandatory, but nonetheless completely useless.  The exams are very much class-based.\n"
