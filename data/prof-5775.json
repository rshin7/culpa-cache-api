However, this class is all based on you and your classmates. The professor pretty much sits at the front and facilitates the discussion.\nWhen I approached her for help prior to the midterm, she simply waved me away, telling me to just work on whatever I had. Basically, it all depends on your understanding and grasping of the material.\nIf you understand and like educational philosophy, like Rousseau's Emile (which is what the class generally revolves around), then you'll enjoy this class.\nWorkload:\n5 weekly response papers, 1 textual response paper, 1 midterm 6-8 pages, 1 final 6-8 pages.\nParticipation is a must. If you miss a class, you have to make it up by writing a 1 page paper.\n"

It was basically organized in the same way, around a big table in which people through out ideas and the teacher responded to them. The texts were usually interesting enough, though it stopped there. Rohrer knew enough about the texts to give some thoughts on them, but she was more open to simply being a facilitator, which then threw the quality of the class on the students, and your engagement would really depend on how much and how well you read.\nJust to give an idea of the texts we read\u00e2\u20ac\u201dPlato, Aristotle, Rousseau, John Dewey, Paulo Freire, Sarte\nWorkload:\nweekly readings (always manageable), 5 short response papers of 1-2 pages, 5-7 midterm paper, 6-8 final paper\n"
