I highly recommend the course to all ChemEs, as well as to any other engineers who are looking for a good pre-professional course, and aren't scared of a little chemistry.\nWorkload:\nOccasional problem sets, which weren't terribly difficult. A midterm in similar style. No final exam, but a small final group project, which didn't require too much work. Workload overall light. [Reviewer A] \n"
