If you are good with hebrew and really understnad the material, the test grades will NOT reflect your knowledge on the material because Michal does not have a standard grading system and makes things up when she feels like it (all ambiguous).  She will take points off left and right for no reason because she can.  Stick with Rina.  \n\nWorkload:\nnot bad. daily homeworks that take no more than ten fiffteen minutes and frequent quizzes. not bad and not time consuming at all.\n"
