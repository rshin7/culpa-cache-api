            "review_content": "\nGrace is an amazing teacher. I took 1101 with a an older professor who wasn't a grad student and even though I got a good grade I still didn't know much Italian. With Grace though, I was able to learn plenty of Italian and she always makes class interesting by including pop culture references and such. She's a great choice for people who actually want to learn to speak Italian, not just fill the requirement.\nWorkload:\nDaily homework assignments that are posted to Courseworks but they're only due every two weeks, a quiz and composition of only 150 words also due every two weeks. Extremely manageable\n"
