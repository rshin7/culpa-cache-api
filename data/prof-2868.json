He engaged my UW class in a pretty non-invasive way, letting us interact with each other and create an open dialogue amongst ourselves.  His grading wasn't terrible and he's pretty available to help you (while his schedule allows, he's getting like a 5 year Doctorate or something.)  All in all, his class didn't give me any heartburn.\nWorkload:\nThe same as every other UW class, the 4 papers and some books to read.  If you show up, and can write a paper using college english, you got yourself an A.\n"
