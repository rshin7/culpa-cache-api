            "review_content": "\nThis discussion-based course was a fun, relaxed, and interesting course. The field of how government works with the internet is constantly evolving, so you will find yourself out on the forefront of the field, and Dr. Wichowski is very encouraging when it comes to publishing your findings if you've done good work. The professor is kind, approachable, and funny, and has lots of interesting stories from her day job at the State Department (US mission to the UN). If you have a professional interest in tech and the public sector, I definitely recommend this course.\nWorkload:\nFor graduate level, minimal, except for a ~20pg research paper due at the end of the term. There is a policy memo due in the middle of the semester, and you'll be assigned to semi-lead discussion for one class at some point the semester along with one or two other students. Readings are probably 30-50 pages a week.\n"
