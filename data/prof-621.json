You will burn serious calories in this class.\nMasone introduces something new each week, like step aerobics for two meetings, then kickboxing the next.  She is adept with combinations and keeps time well.  Also, she allows students to go at their own pace, offering both high- and lo-intensity options.  \nIf Laura Masone offered a FitBear class, I would sign up to work out with her again in a heartbeat!\nWorkload:\nJust class -- but don't take this class if you plan on having a lecture or something afterward.  You will want time to shower.\n"

I admire Laura a lot...she's absolutely FANTASTIC - hilarious, smart, friendly, and plays great music. I thought the class was fun , a good workout, but not too challenging. You get to learn dance routines to old-school hip-hop! A really fun way to fulfill your PE req.\n"

If it's nice outside, she takes the class outdoors to walk around Riverside Park. When class is indoors,she plays funky disco and 80's workout music (and she doesn't hesitate to sing along). But we warned: if you're looking for a gym class where you won't have to break a sweat, don't take this one.\n"
