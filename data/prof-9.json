It is the most boring class you will ever sit in, and on top of that Professor D'Altroy is the least funny person on the planet. He tries to make it interesting but to be honest it does not really work. The midterm was super easy, just two civilizations, Egypt and Mesopotamia and the papers are easy if you put 1-2 hours into them. I did find the context interesting but Professor D'Altroy needs to figure his stuff out. Now the way he grades is very unique. I received a B- because I got a low B...that does not make sense. He was not sympathetic in a grade change. Do not take this class, it is way too boring, I watched television in class and did other class work. And the final is kind of difficult, it pulls on literally everything, the topics are very broad so you can sometimes BS but it depends what TA grades it.\nWorkload:\nTwo (5-7 page) papers (15% each)\n1 midterm (30%)\n1 final (40%)\n"

The lectures (on material that could actually be very interesting) are extremely monotonous, the slides have very few explanations on them--only pictures, and a lot of the time the objectives of the course, what you're expected to know, etc is very unclear. If you like anthro/history it might be a bit more interesting to you but like the lecture portion of it at least i felt was poorly executed. That being said it was like extremely easy. I did no reading, (except for pulling some quotes out of the text for papers) literally 0 work aside from the days before an exam or a paper was due, and turned out absolutely fine. I guess if you're looking for a global core with very minimal work, go for it, but don't expect to be enlightened or even slightly intellectually stimulated. \nI think the best thing that happened to me in this course was when I beat 2048 that fateful wednesday afternoon. \nWorkload:\nLike none-- 2 papers 7-8 pages each that you can crank out a few nights before, the prompts are like extremely broad and are just begging to be bullshitted. Each paper is 15% I believe-- a midterm (30%) and a final (40%) that both consist of identifying and writing something brief about 2 or 3 key vocab terms, and doing either 1 or 2 essay questions that are again very broad.. enjoy Terry's stache\n"

Beware. The class, however, is enjoyable in the sense that I gained a new perspective on time by learning about Civilizations from 5000B.C. onward. \nWhen I was on Ritalin, I gained the most from this class because I was able to absorb Prof's deceptively fast-paced lectures. Take notes. You chiefly draw from lectures on exams. Read the texts, even though you dont *have* to, it helps you with the papers. \nT.A. section seminars are there to answer your questions, grade your papers, and serve as a guide to the course--yet, half the time I was watching futbol, and playing 2048...\nWhat is the real killer is that if you cant stand museums, this class is basically a tour of museums and historical landmarks, in a dimly lit lecture hall. When we were talking about anthropology, however, my interest was captivated. \nI could've taken better advantage of this class, but thus far it has been my favorite class at Columbia because of how it expanded my horizon of how society develops and has come to where it is today. \nOh, and I got a B- for the course. \nFirst paper: 76\nSecond Paper: 96\nMidterm Exam: 73\nFinal Exam: 82\n\nWorkload:\n2 Papers, Midterm, Final, Optional/Required Readings\n"

It's very well run-- TAs respond quickly to e-mails and grade quickly. The lectures are interesting enough if somewhat boring at times (especially when some of the TAs pseudo-guest lecture while d'altroy is absent). \nYou really don't need to buy the books, just read through them at Butler and take notes before the midterm/final. D'altroy holds a review session before every exam and doesn't write the exam until the night before which seems fair. Strangely, D'altroy facilitates and seems to enjoy that half the class never attends as he always posts the powerpoint and in depth lecture notes. Don't be fooled though, I think he only does this in order to encourage some kids from attending in order to make the curve easier to create/maintain etc. \nIt's not a course that you will worry about, but it's also not a joke course that you never have to put any work into. Primarily because the papers that were originally 1-2 page responses without any sources are now 7-8 page research papers despite containing the same prompt... kind of a cheap way to make a course more challenging but whatever. Some of the TAs are amusing, some are sleep-inducing boring, but it's kind of a lottery based on when you can actually fit one into your schedule...\nEasy enough to do well if you put the work in and try to do it. D'altroy was a bit self-indulgent with the jokes, innuendos, and elitism, but overall an entertaining lecturer. \n\nWorkload:\nTwo 7-8 page essays (30%) with fairly dry prompts\nMidterm (30%) just on egypt and mesopotamia - fairly easy\nFinal (30%) - same. fairly easy. if you go to lecture you will be able to identify the themes that he will test you on\nOverall: Go to lecture, take notes, do the readings before the exams, take advantage of TAs\nGrade received: A-\n"

            "review_content": "\nI seriously do not think Professor D'Altroy is a good professor.  The way he comes off is seriously pretentious and I honestly went away with the impression that he did not care about the course, which affected the way I prioritized it, and my grade suffered accordingly.\nOne of the most egregious aspects of his poor performance as professor is the fact that there were, to my knowledge, at least 6 lectures which he was absent for.  To be fair, one of the times was scheduled, as the head TA (Darryl Wilkinson) was assigned with that day's material on Sub-Saharan Africa, and actually did a fantastic job and gave what I think was unquestionably the best lecture of the entire course.  The other 5 occasions, as far as I could tell, were cases of Professor D'Altroy clearly prioritizing other endeavors of his above the course; two consecutive sessions (i.e. an entire week's worth of classes) were missed in the week immediately following Spring Break, because of supposed problems scheduling the return flight from Peru (which, to be quite honest, I completely did not believe, especially in light of the absences that followed; he clearly wanted an extra week of vacation / study in his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153area of expertise\u00e2\u20ac\u009d - truly shameful).  He missed another entire week of classes because, obviously, going to a conference at Oxford was more important to him than teaching the introductory course in the department he used to chair.  This goes right in line with his arrogant, pretentious attitude that he brings into every lecture, in which I honestly felt I was not getting very detailed information, due to his preference for bashing Western European intellectual historiography.\nI think as long as Professor D'Altroy heads the course it's doomed, because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no way there can be a serious exploration of the rise of civilizations around the world in any level of useful detail, when the course is headed by an academic who cares more about a pseudo-intellectual agenda obsessed with bashing the West and its historical epistemological approaches than in the actual civilizations being studied or in the students who are trying to learn about them.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m embarrassed that this is the largest class at Columbia; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real shame.\nI overall had less problems with my TA, Dianne Scullin, than I did with Professor D'Altroy, but I felt she also failed to inspire intellectual interest in the material.\nHer feedback on my second paper (which I got what I honestly feel is an undeservedly low grade after my hard work had been rewarded on the first one), was almost nonexistent, despite the fact that my work merited barely above a C in her eyes.  Her only annotations on my paper were ones saying \"good\" toward the beginning, then on the last page she wrote 80 / B- and a terse note saying that I didn't address the prompt, without explaining why or how.  I put just as much work into that paper as I did the first one, which I got a solid A on.\nI would have felt comfortable asking her about it, except for the fact that she consistently failed to cultivate an atmosphere in which I would have been comfortable interacting with her; she blatantly ignored an e-mail I sent to her early in the semester regarding a scheduling conflict with her discussion section, in which I very politely asked to switch into one that met in the same room the hour before our time.  As a result of her unwillingness to respond to the e-mail, I felt uncomfortable asking her anything (including for elaborated feedback on my second paper), and had to forego a job opportunity I would have been able to take in that time slot.\nShe also led the discussion section with a listless, disinterested, and passionless flat affect that could not possibly inspire any intellectual curiosity.\nThe assignments and materials for the class perfectly mirror the content: overly generic, poorly explained, and not worthwhile.  The two papers are on topics that are superficial and broad, and that leave no room for academic creativity.  In addition, they don't in any way productively contribute toward learning anything in any level of detail that is asked of us on the midterm or final, so they were just pointless.  Also, the grading (as has been mentioned) was completely inconsistent.  I got a solid A on the first paper, and then nearly a C on the second one, and I put the same amount of work and thought into both of them.\nThe readings are obviously pointless, as neither the professor nor our TA ever addressed them besides saying that they were all required, which is obviously false, which is reprehensible for causing everyone to waste tons of money on expensive materials that aren't even incorporated.\nI think as long as Professor D'Altroy heads the course it's doomed, because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no way there can be a serious exploration of the rise of civilizations around the world in any level of useful detail, when the course is headed by an academic who cares more about a pseudo-intellectual agenda obsessed with bashing the West and its historical epistemological approaches than in the actual civilizations being studied or in the students who are trying to learn about them.  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m embarrassed that this is the largest class at Columbia; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real shame.\nWorkload:\n2 pointless papers that used to be 2-3 pages with the same prompts, but that apparently grow every year (they were 7-8 pages this year, so next year they could be 10-12 pages or something, for all anyone knows)\na midterm and final that ask you for information in much more specificity than is in any way reasonable given the way the course is presented\n"

Because on paper, it sounds like it would be in an interesting course.  Unfortunately, only the former is true.  It is very easy to get an A in this class, so by all means, you should take it (especially if your GPA needs a little bump).  However, D'Altroy is not a very interesting lecturer.  Some time around the end of January, I stopped going to class entirely, with the exception of the midterm and the class before it.  He doesn't exactly make it essential that you go to class, either.  All of his lecture notes are posted online (hint: there are way too many of them.  Dude doesn't know how to write an efficient outline.  But hey, all the more help to slackers like myself?).  All of his powerpoints are posted online.  Don't print these.  He saves them at the highest quality possible, so they take forever to print.

Most of the time, if you do actually go to class, the people around you will be doing one of three things: eating lunch, talking to their friends around them, or dicking around on the internet.\nAll that said, DO go to your recitation section.

He's not the most entertaining, but he has a genuine enthusiasm for the subject matter. He is also a very nice guy, very easy to talk to and happy to answer questions. The Price and Feinman text is overpriced and pretty useless, but the Wenke is excellent. The Wenke text, and the class as a whole, made me decide to change my major to archaeology. Whether you're an anthro or history major, or just need a class to fill major cultures, there's a good bet you'll enjoy this class.\nWorkload:\nmanageable reading, one midterm, one final, optional paper, optional discussion sections, lots of details to learn but the class is more about overall trends so don't be scared by this\n"

It's a lot of reading, but more like a lot of skimming the readings and seeing what he hits upon in the lectures...which are online anyway.  He works hard to make an info-heavy course as easy to get through as possible.  A couple complaints: The textbook is useless, his lecture notes are good enough on their own.  Also, he tends to spend a few too many slides on burial crafts.  Sure, spend a few minutes on King Tut's sweet loot, but when every single early civilization had rich people with graves full of cool stuff,  after a while he could've just said so and moved on.\nTD covers each culture from a basic set of perspectives to establish a good comparative base of knowledge about early civilizations.  Very informative, somewhat repetitive.\nHe knows a lot of really interesting stories and details.  Basically, he's perfect if you're interested in the subject matter; very knowledgeable, can put together a good lecture, VERY approachable, sort of funny.  Just prepare for lots of pottery slides.\n\nWorkload:\nmidterm, final, optional paper, optional TA sessions.  Midterm and final were put together in a very fair manner.\n"

He likes to go over a large amount of information so he's forced to generalize everything, which makes the class uninteresting. His lecture style needs some improvment; he often mumbles, doesn't talk loud enough, and groups large words together so it makes his point confusing (he sounds exactly like the textbook). The TA is much better at conveying the information. The tests format was standard. The most difficult thing in studying for them however is that there is just SO MUCH information to memorize that you often end up cramming. I wish he would have told the class what terms to not study because their were so many of them. I have to say I'm disappointed with this class. It wasn't as intricate or as interesting as my East Asian China class with professor Schoenenbaum. \nWorkload:\nMidterm 33%, Final 67% or optional paper 25% midterm 25% final 50%\n"

            "review_content": "\n First of all, Professor D'Altroy is a really nice guy. Not a pushover, though. His lectures are really packed with a lot of information and the pace is very fast. He clearly outlines the basic themes of the course at the beginning...how to sythesize and approach the material. If one keeps these points in mind when taking notes and studying, it really is not an overload.  I felt this semester was heavier on theory than I anticipated from reading past Culpa reviews.  We were encouraged throughout to utilize the \"big picture.\" Before the exams, D'Altroy gave out example essay questions and I found this helpful.  There is a manageable amount of reading - not light (if one does all of it), but certainly not horrible. Plus, in the final crunch, the outlines supplied by D'Altroy are what I relied on for exam preparation and fleshed this out with class notes. This course can appear overwhelming, with a moderate effort combined with strategic studying, it is not that hard to get an A in this course. I felt that the very nature of the course whas such that I felt we kind of skimmed over the cultures...(despite the fact that D'Altroy speaks very fast and really tries to cram as much in as he humanly can). It is a fair overview and comparison. One high compliment for D'Altroy: If he doesn't know something (he admits that China is not his strongpoint), he will honestly and refreshingly say \"I don't know.\" But this guy knows a whole lot. He's not an armchair intellectual having spend decades in the field. His area of expertise is South America especially Peru. I recommend this course. \nWorkload:\nModerate to heavy reading (you don't have to do all of it, but a few of the journal articles under your belt will give your essays a real boost), one optional paper (this is not for extra credit and will alter your grade breakdown), weekly recitation sessions, mid-term and final.\n"

Though I regret not going to most of the lectures, because I was pretty stumped on the final. I suggest going to at least 75% of them. I wish I did have a chance to get to know D'Altroy more, his dry humor makes it all worth it. But I guess if you aren't the type to stare at pictures of skeletons and old archaeology sites, don't take the class. \nWorkload:\nManagable, if you don't attend lectures-buy the notes and print the slides.

Attention to minute detail suddenly becomes intensely theoretical  I believe that if Prof. D'Altroy could strike a balance between the detail and the theory, he would really have quite a class.  But until that point, this class is recommended only to those with the drive to a) continually pack away a load of information or b) execute a massive pre-exam cram session.  The stuff is really interesting, though.

            "review_content": "\nI completely disagree with the reviews below--and I'm not even an Anthro major. Terence D'Altroy is a very good teacher because he's passionate about his subject. Where I think people get tripped up is that his passion weirdly enough takes the form of some of the driest humor that I've ever encountered. He said some of the most hilarious things with a straight face and deadpan delivery so if you're nodding off, of course you'll miss it. Once, when the TAs forgot the slides for half of his lecture, he just cycled through using the same slides but lecturing on a different civilization--it was hilarious to hear him make these off the cuff jokes, self depreciating comments and and brilliant reaches that managed to related the slides and a totally different idea. But most those who were asleep later freaked out when they discovered that their notes and the slides didn't match--what a great litmus test for a teacher to figure out who's paying attention... He has negative tolerance for stupidity (hear that, Third Row Guy with the Jaguar fetish?), and even less tolerance for bullshit (\"But its so much memorization!\" just doesn't fly with this class; do it or drop it. Or better yet, talk to the TAs. They know their shit and do an amazing job of breaking it down to bite size pieces. Make friends with them--I didn't do this but I should have). That said, D'Altroy has admitted that every year he tries to strike a balance between concepts and memorization, and usually he inadvertently leans to one side or the other. My semester, it was towards memorization. If you do the reading (which I skimmed the few days before the final exam) and attend the sections (which I didn't--I was a first semester freshman and no one had told me about them, so you're not dealing with someone who's always on top of things), then you should definitely be able to manage a decent grade; I got an A-. Also, its a big class so if anonymity is your thing, then this is probably a good choice. Though D'Altroy probably has only the vaguest idea who I am, I nevertheless credit him with helping me choose my Urban Studies major. Quite a bit of Rise of Civ deals with emergence of urbanism. The info is interesting; it *is* manageable; moreover, it gives a great non-western perspective of what was going on at the same time as half of the lit hum & cc syllabus (Those of you who bitch about the core--do us all favor and transfer to Brown). Similarly, its really useful your second List A major cultures, because you'll have a solid background from which to work with there as well. I'd recommend this to anyone who's interesting in actually getting something out of their classes. If you want a comfy seat in class to sleep, and a professor to hold your hand and give you an A anyway, you could probably do it too; but why would you want to when you've got a good guy like D'Altroy to teach you?\nWorkload:\nMidterm, Final, and optional paper. Attendence to recitations recommended to stave the info freak-out for those of you inclined to do so. \n"

As other reviews have pointed out, there is just way too much information covered to A) make it at all interesting or in-depth or B) understand it. I went to recitation with the TAs who seemed to know nothing about the subject, my TA couldn't even find the answer to my question with the book in front of him. But, if you're good at memorizing thousands of things you will never ever have a use for for the rest of your life, then maybe you want to take this class. D'Altroy seemed very interesting although the lectures were ridiculously boring (he even brought us coffee and tea to the final) so maybe a seminar would be better.

It was a small seminar, every week we would sit around and discuss diferent theories as to why states and complex societies emerged. If you are not interested in this topic, dont take the class it is reading and thinking intensive. But if you are, you will not regret it at all.

However, one thing that is not done well and is also essential for the midterm and final is tying all the infomration together and making connections.

I talked to him about this, and he said that he tries to strike the balance between data and theory but usually it's too strong on one side or the other (I had a data-strong class).
