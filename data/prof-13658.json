To follow the previous review and underscore how bad she is, I'm pretty sure that nobody in our class got an A. She was completely ineffective at explaining the already impenetrable reading. The only chance to get over a B in the class entailed going and sitting with her in the writing center and walking out more confused than when you entered. Do not take this section under any circumstance it will make your first year that much harder.\nWorkload:\nSevere toxic amounts.\n"
