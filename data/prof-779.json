I don't care much for the Core, but I did my work for class (when I easily could have gotten away without doing anything) because I absolutely loved having discussions with this man. He is genuinely caring, and try not to be put off if he doesn't remember your name! He holds to his ideals and is a brilliant, brilliant person. You will be lucky just to have one conversation with him, let alone an entire year of classes. He teaches you to write, and he's so good at what he does. I felt inspired just by being around him. Seriously, seriously my favorite. \nWorkload:\nmuch lighter, but do the work! You will learn so much and grow a lot with this Professor if you put in the effort--and it is worth it! \n"

It\u2019s the big things (how to be human; how to live life) that he\u2019s interested in. Don\u2019t waste your time brooding over whether he likes you as a person. He\u2019s wiser than that \u2013 he\u2019ll see through you.

Just focus on what you can do as a student to best learn from the man. \nOne caveat \u2013 that said, don\u2019t take this class as a joke. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a tough class. It\u2019s not. But it is going to be tough if you don\u2019t enter the classroom with an open mind, ready to learn. Put in the effort but not that of brute force. Put your effort into answering the questions that genuinely interest you.

            "review_content": "\nThis class really left something to be desired. I can't speak for his other classes (Lit Hum in particular), but I did not find Mendelson to be a very interesting or engaging lecturer. What an incredible reading list -- I'm not even really into modern lit (I prefer older stuff), but there were some great texts on the syllabus, plus a good mix of poetry and prose. What a disappointment this class was. I really wanted to love this class, and him, but I just couldn't. And quite frankly, I don't know what the big deal is with him. I'm sure he knows his material, but he sure as hell didn't show that he knows it.\nHis lectures were pretty surface level, and I never felt like we really got into the texts. There was pretty little incentive to do the reading, show up to class, or put in any effort into this class whatsoever after like, the first two or three weeks. His quirks are interesting, funny at first. But they get old really quickly. I don't care who wears a baseball cap in class, who uses a phone or a laptop, or who (ffs!) spills coffee on accident or comes in late. No need to address each of these people personally. It's a completely waste of time. God forbid someone spills her coffee in NoCo 501 and some people next to her help clean it up. No need to stop your lecture so you can ask this person what's wrong, and then offer to come and help her clean up her coffee. That's not even funny.\nI would forgive these quirks if I felt like his lectures were really insightful or engaging (but let's face it, if they were, he wouldn't be stopping them every 5 minutes). The reviewer from 2006 got it right when s/he wrote: What? I must be dreaming, because I know I didn't just spend my 9 ams on Monday and Wednesday attending a glorified season of Reading Rainbow. (In fact, go back and read reviews from like 06 and 03 -- that's how I felt about Mendelson. Can't figure out if he's regressed or something because the most recent reviews make him sound like God. I particularly like the review_dated Nov. 19, 2003.)\nExcept in my case, it was Tuesday/Thursday at 10 in Noco. His lectures are painful. He goes through the text line by line and explains it. There's barely any analysis -- he just tells you what happens and then doesn't analyze it, talk about themes, etc. He constantly also says that what he says is unimportant because he has no way of knowing what the writers were really thinking, and keeps asking if we understand what he's saying. \nI'd have to agree with all the reviewers who said that Mendelson thinks his students are idiots. He takes attendance in a lecture, for Christ's sake. So you can't even skip the horrendous lectures. There were days I would go to sign the attendance sheet and then leave. He also INSISTS that all papers should begin with a quote and then an analysis of that quote and then get into the larger picture. I'm all for skipping the useless intro and getting right into what you want to say, but teaching students how to write better isn't as simple as giving them a formula on the back of the syllabus and asking them to follow it. Everyone has his/her own style and the best profs are the ones who give tailored advice on how to improve what you have. \nAlso, he complains all the time about grading and has repeatedly said in lecture that we should all write good papers and follow the instructions so it's easier for him to grade, since good papers are easier to grade than bad papers. Then we get our papers back and it turns out some random TAs that we lay our eyes on maybe once on the first day of class did ALL the grading (which is pretty arbitrary). \nThe one good thing about this class is that it's ridiculously easy. He says in lecture repeatedly that he sees grades like swim times... only your best time (or grade) counts. Also, his class is so poorly run that if he gave out bad grades I'm sure people would like him a whole lot less.\nTL DR - This class is a total waste of time. It's really only good if you want a grade boost, since you don't even really have the option of doing all the reading on your own and skipping the painful painful lectures, but then you have to sit through all the lectures without any electronics. I don't get what the fuss is about Mendelson but I certainly won't ever take another class with him.\nWorkload:\n3 600-800 word \"papers\", plus one final. \nThe final is a bunch of IDs plus an essay. The essay is ridiculously easy if you have done any reading whatsoever, and he acknowledges that (it's just to check if you've done your reading! if you have a brain and you're not asleep you can think of something to say! blah blah)\nThe IDs were hard for me because I didn't do all the reading/didn't read that carefully. But it didn't even matter that I probably got a bunch of them wrong.\n"

If there's anyone who truly deserves one, it's Professor Mendelson.\nI don't think a review can possibly express how great of a professor he really is. His class will make you think of the world in a way that you probably never did before. With his years of experience at Columbia, he knows what he's talking about. If you happen to be in his class, consider yourself to be amongst the luckiest of freshman at Columbia. It is classes like these that you will be constantly reminded of, mainly because of how much you genuinely learn about individuality and how the world works in general.\nAt the beginning of the semester, Mendelson assures his students that his section of LitHum will be a completely low-stress section. His reason being that he believes that in doing so, it allows the students to feel more comfortable in class, which in turn results in clearer thinking. Coming into the class, I didn't know how well it would work, since it allowed those students who didn't want to do a lot of the reading an opportunity to slack off. However, in the end, it proved to be an effective method of fostering a highly efficient academic environment.\nTop top it all off, not only is he (arguably) the best professor you can find for LitHum, but he is also a pretty lenient grader. He usually assigns two (arbitrarily unimportant) grades: one each for ideas and writing, the latter of which he'll probably rip apart most students for. However, he does this because he truly understands how one needs to write to effectively get their ideas across to their audience, whomever they may be.\nGet ready for a great year with him!\nWorkload:\nNot much, just reading the books\n"

You get the best of both worlds: his insights into the books are fantastic, and he's a completely reasonable, understanding person (i.e., he is an easy professor). Mendelson wants you above all to think--he won't take any bullshit (anything you say in class should be grounded in the text), and he wants you to think of things that are actually interesting. If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and google him. You'll quickly discover (by the length of his wikipedia page and the many books he's published) that Mendelson is quite famous. The fact that he's teaching a core class to freshmen when he could be doing whatever the hell wanted (publishing more books, teaching grad students, etc), says a lot about how much he cares about his students.\nYou might be intimidated by his first e-mail and your first class. (I think the e-mail forbade laptops, food, giving yourself intellectual authority by categorizing yourself, etc.) I definitely was. But in reality, he's the most understanding professor I've ever had, or ever will have. Need a few day's extra to finish that no-longer-than-1000-word-essay? No problem. Need to miss a class? No worries at all.\nIf you're lucky enough to be placed into section, do NOT switch sections. Compared to other sections, you will not sweat. Mendelson doesn't exactly hold you accountable for the work; rather, he makes classes genuinely interesting so you want to do the work in order to engage in discussion and critical thinking. Sure, there were times when probably two people did the reading--I think Don Quixote was the worst--but Mendelson totally understands how stressed your life can be and doesn't take it personally (like other professors often do). As other reviewers have said, he wants you to read because the books are genuinely interesting--not because they're part of some curriculum.\nWhere is his gold nugget? This man is the nicest, most understanding, easiest, most fascinating professor (throw in as many great superlatives as you want) to teach the core. More importantly, though, he made me think.\nWorkload:\nAbout a book per week like most sections, though he does frequently trim the amount of reading you have to do for a book (Herodotus' Histories), or he decides to get rid of entire books (i.e., Boccaccio's Decameron), or he substitutes a shorter book for a longer one (i.e., Notes from Underground instead of Crime and Punishment).\nNo midterm a 1-hour stress-free final. Fucking amazing compared to ANY other section. Plus two 1000-word essays, in which he wants concise and simple writing (for example, he crossed out the word \"attempt\" in my first paper and wrote \"try\" above it).\nIt's pretty easy to get an \"A\" in his class; once you figure out what he wants and make genuinely illuminating insights into the books in class and in your papers, you can even get an \"A+\" in the class.\n"

Even more, though, Mendelson is a fantastic teacher, passionate and (usually) very articulate about all three poets. I've come away from this class with a totally different conception of modern verse (or at least the narrow slice of it we studied).\nAs for the infamous laundry list of proscribed objects and behaviors? The point is that Mendelson wants to be able to make eye contact with everyone in the room while he's lecturing, to watch how people react to the things he says. He's one of the few instructors I've had that actually responded to people's expressions of puzzlement or disapproval, and the only one I've had that made a 70-person class feel like an intimate personal discussion.\nIn short, take this class.\nWorkload:\nLight.

You quickly learn to like him and realize that he's actually kind of amazing. He is really everything you look for in a Lit Hum Professor. He's ridiculously well read, he's engaging and most of all he's very supportive. Our classes on To the Lighthouse and the Bible especially interesting because he just knows so much about them. He made me love the books that he loves. He has very specific requirements for how to write his papers that can be frustrating at times, which he understands so he encourages everyone to come to office hours. \nHis class is all about discussion. He assumes that you've read the book so you spend very little time going over plot. He's only interested in talking about the bigger (often very abstract) ideas in each book. He's loves hearing your interpretation, though he's not afraid to tell you that he thinks its wrong or that you're \"reaching\" as he calls it. But if you're point is interesting, he'll continue to talk about it and turn it into a much more sophisticated point that you had originally intended. It's also not hard to get away with not finishing all the reading. The few times he noticed that no one had finished the reading, he didn't seem to care that much. He wants you to read the books not because they're required but because they're worth reading. \n\nMendelson seems like the stereotypical pretentious professor, but he's not and he acknowledges when he's being like that. He's not afraid to say something controversial and regularly does (sometimes with his favorite \"irony light\" on). He also is open about the problems with the Lit Hum syllabus. We would spend a chunk of class talking about them towards the end of the semester. Sometime in the semester you'll realize that the majority of the stuff  he talks about are his own ideas, and that other professor actually reference him. Oh and he brings you apples every Thursday and jokes about how the apple you pick says something about you. \nWorkload:\nLight compared to other sections\nReading: Around a book every week. He doesn't think there's a point to assigning you more than you will actually read, so he often cuts down the reading from the official reading list to make sure we have real discussions in class. He will also replace a longer book with a shorter one he likes more.  \nPapers: Two paragraphs in the first few weeks + two papers for the first semester and just two papers for the second semester. The papers are supposed to be somewhere between 1000-1500 words, but he honestly doesn't care if they're well done but on the short side. He rip your paper apart, but he wants to help you improve your writing. \nExams: No midterm (!) and a super easy one hour final\nBasically, he doesn't care about grades. He just wants to learn. \n"

Prof. Mendelson has a wonderful speaking voice, and is a great lecturer. I think he gives immensely valuable insight into all of the works, and is great at putting things into perspective. He is also very accessible for office hours, and is super nice and helpful in them. You can tell that this guy is ultra smart.\nA few words of warning, however. Mendelson is very picky about weird things, especially with respect to writing style. Some reviewers apparently don't like Mendelson for this, and I'll admit he does occasionally come off as being a bit pompous. Mendelson is the only professor I've ever had who did not like my writing style, and I'll admit it hurt at first, but you just have to realize he's just picky and try to fix it. That being said, he really wants to give you a good grade, provided you do the work. You can get an A in this class easily as long as you read the books and put a little thought behind your papers (I did, even though I routinely got A for content, B for style on my papers). Paper due dates are VERY loose. He really does not care if you turn your paper in a little late, as long as its good. He'd rather have a good paper than a late paper. Despite this, he is extremely strict in class. If you even look like you are talking to your neighbor or texting, he will call you out immediately. You are also not allowed to wear hats or have laptops. All of this is, I believe, to prevent him from getting distracted. Finally, the last and most important warning, GO TO CLASS! He sends around an attendance sheet maybe 75% of the time (the other 25% is only because he forgets). If you consistently don't come to class he will either deregister you or fail you, depending on how late in the semester it is. I actually witnessed him verbally failing some poor kid who I guess decided to start going to class 2/3 of the way into the semester. That being said, he will give you a little wiggle room for illness etc. I missed 4 classes for no reason and still got an A.\nOverall, I loved the class. Lectures were interesting and workload was not terrible. I took this class for fun (I'm a senior science major) and am immensely glad I did, and not just because of the nice GPA boost.\nWorkload:\nnot too bad. The novel readings are heavy, poetry readings aren't too bad. The books are good so I didn't mind. 3 papers, 600-800 words (900 max), one final which was ridiculously easy, only exists to ensure you read all the books and payed attention in lecture.\n"

But it turns out that the list of things he does allow is much longer and far outweighs the first list: toward the end of the semester he brought in a bag of apples to pass around almost every class; he doesn't get all that mad if you fall asleep (discreetly) during a lecture once in a while; he doesn't really mind if you turn in a paper a few days late; and by the end of the term it was clear that he knew and didn't really care that not everyone had done all of the reading all the time.\nAll in all, Professor Mendelson is amazing.\nDefinitely do not be scared of him (though his booming voice and wild gesticulating can sometimes make him seem like someone to be intimidated by) but keep in mind that he is not a pushover. He was the only professor I had this semester that wasn't completely full of shit \u00e2\u20ac\u201d after handing our first papers back to us, he went on for about ten minutes about how they were all bullshit (not his words) and that next time we should all strive to write about something real, something we actually care about, \"something someone would ACTUALLY WANT to read,\" as he said. He told us he doesn't read the teacher evaluations we have to fill out, \"because it is insulting for you to have to fill them out, and insulting for me to read them.\" He deals with obnoxious people in class in a satisfying way, because while he doesn't completely shut them down, he shuts them up relatively quickly so discussion can continue. I actually came to respect Mendelson as a person, not only a professor.\nHe was also the only professor I had this semester (and probably the only one I'll ever have) who told us to not stress about the class AND ALSO actually conducted the course in a way which made this possible (an unprecedented combination for me). The last week of class, he told us continually to not stress about the final, and lo and behold, the heading of our final was \"Lit Hum Final Exam: Now with reduced anxiety!\" He told us an hour into the final that we should be finishing up at that point, which most of us were actually doing.\nIt's really not difficult to get an A. But you'll get a lot more out of the class if you make an effort to read at least some of all the texts, and pay attention to what he says about them during class. His lectures, responses to questions, and input into the discussion are usually pretty interesting. He's extremely intelligent and yet unpretentious, another unprecedented combination for me. Professor Mendelson is great; I think our class was unanimous on this.\nWorkload:\nMake a vague effort to do at least some of the reading. Show up to class.

(Auden appointed him executor in 1972 after Mendelson used his cache of copies of Auden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work to help the poet assemble a collection of prose, Forewords and Afterwords.)\" I'll explain: \nAround 1970, the elderly WH Auden, who was, after Eliot, the most influential 20th century British poet, unable to find copies of his early work, discovered that a Yale grad student had collected them. Auden made a bold decision. He invited the young man to hang out with him and his ancient, drunken, famous poet friends, answered all his questions, and made the kid his literary executor, his literary heir. It's forty years later. Auden (b. 1907) and his modernist generation have been gone for thirty years, and only Ed Mendelson, himself now in his sixties, can write of the great English modernist poets from first hand knowledge. He is acknowledged as their finest interpreter, and our last living link to them.  Does that fact appear anywhere in these reviews? What does?  He won't let you wear your baseball cap in class. And this site dares to call itself \"professorial ability?\" You're evaluating yourselves, and with terrible clarity.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nIt's not that he's a bad teacher--he's not.  But the entire class is based solely on his interpretations of Auden, Eliot and Yeats.  He complains about how \"typical English classes\" are run, and insists that to read your own personal experiences in the poetry is arrogant, and forces you to look at what the poem itself is saying.  This isn't a bad method, but the constant mocking of this not-preferred poetry analysis method wears thin, as does his constant repetition of the same stories and analogies from January to May: the \"weird Goth student\" who always sat in the back that he looked up on Facebook, the previous student who asked stupid questions, the outraged student.  In fact, he almost seemed a bit disappointed that no one in the class was able to provide him with new fodder. \nThe class itself breaks down into about four weeks of Yeats, three weeks of Eliot, and six weeks of Auden.  It feels unbalanced, and once you're aware that Auden is his specialty, it does make more sense, in a way.\nIf you like reading poetry, you'll like the class. You'll be bored at 9:10 in the morning (though he's always late) and frustrated that you can't bring a laptop, but your homework is reading three really great poets, so it's worth it.  Just don't expect Professor Mendelson to suddenly light up the world of understanding poetry for you--as he'll tell you, he doesn't think one is meant to find the Great Truth in poetry.\nWorkload:\nThree 800 word papers, one for each author, that start analyzing a line or two from a poem from the assigned author and then moving out to a macroscopic scale.

I took this class after reading all of the other sparkling reviews about how EM is such a great guy and loves to give As. The class is easy and the reading is light, true, but it's also horrifically boring. Even EM knows he's boring! (He mentioned at the beginning of the semester that he'd try to open the floor for questions at the end of each class because our attention would start to wane.) \nI can also believe and agree with the comments I've read about EM considering his undergrad students to be idiots. I agree, it's a little depressing to hear a student fumble through a question with a lot of 'um's and 'uh's, but EM can be really harsh in response. (For example, shouting \"PROJECT!\" at every meek female in the class doesn't encourage many others to ask questions. Also, pointing out that the answer to a question is \"Obvious\" or \"Silly\" doesn't make for much conversation.) Finally, his tangents (due to poor lesson planning or forgetting to bring his book) often make him hard to follow or even incomprehensible.\nI think what bothered me most was that Mendelson's style of teaching is so opinionated and biased that he doesn't leave any room for his students to question him.\nNot at all the gold nugget I'd been hoping for. =/\nWorkload:\n3 very brief papers and a final.

Once I got over how intimidating he came off in the beginning and got a bit more comfortable in his presence, I started to enjoy his class much more. He has his quirks: Do not stutter or say \u00c2\u201clike\u00c2\u201d or \u00c2\u201cum\u00c2\u201d excessively because he will interrupt you and move on. While he does have his somewhat loud and intimidating intellectual side, he is also a very kind, gentle guy. I never went, but I have heard he is very pleasant in office hours. I think he is the kind of professor who likes to meet in office hours so that he feels like he knows you on some kind of level other than the occasional comment in class. At first, I thought he was randomly favoring a couple of people in class but then I realized they were all people who had met with him in his office. After realizing that, I couldn\u00c2\u2019t be bitter since I hadn\u00c2\u2019t taken the time to actually go myself. \nIf you tend to read like Vandenburg or have just completed a class with her, avoid her kind of readings in his class. He reads what IS on the page\u00c2\u2026not what is not there or what seems to be suggested. I have heard people refer to this as a \u00c2\u201csixth grade level of reading,\u00c2\u201d but I think it is just a different kind of reading that so many of us have gotten away from. Theoretical readings can be fascinating and eye opening when led by someone knowledgeable enough to back them up. But, a bunch of undergraduates running around talking about theory can get pretty ugly. Do not get me wrong, you cannot just read each text and spit out obvious observations in Mendelson\u00c2\u2019s class. What you need to do is read each text carefully and make connections based on what IS there. \nBooks include, Secret Agent by Joseph Conrad, Return of the Soldier by Rebecca West, Tono Bungay by HG Wells, Riceyman Steps by Arnold Bennett, and Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf. There was not much focus on how they all tied together or how they were \"alternatives to modernism\" but discussion was usually interesting nonetheless. \n\nWorkload:\nModerate amount of reading.

So in other words, his class is high school, but weird, meta high school, where the teachers are always making jokes about how worthless high school is, but doing it ironically--except minus the irony.

You can't teach a high school class at a university and spend the bulk of it complaining about high school--you can't have faceless TAs grade silly papers in a manner adherent to very specific but unstated personal guidelines--you can't ask people to show up for the bad 9AM lectures you take attendance for--and then give them Bs.

He can come off as gruff and intense to say the least, but in person he is really friendly.  I DO NOT recommend him for poetry, especially at 9am.  Sure, he's knowlegeable about the poetry (or it seemed like it at lease) but the lectures consist entirely of rambling, almost always incoherent diatribes where he reads huge chunks of the poems, says, \"In other words...\" says something random, and then asks (demands of) the class, \"Are you getting my meaning here?\"  He harps on the same themes constantly, and by the end of the semester I was still waiting to actually learn something about Auden beyond what I could have gotten by purchasing a copy of his selected works (edited, of course, by Mendelson himself) and reading them on my own.  I don't know if all poetry classes leave one feeling this dissatisfied, but this one definitely did.  On the other had, the poems were great, and if nothing else I was happy I took the class because I got to read them all.\nWorkload:\nReading a lot of poems by Yeats, Eliot, and Auden.  Two 3-4 page papers (sooo easy) analyzing a poem.  Final (which I haven't taken yet) looks to be hard... you have to memorize an entire poem and recognize poems (author and title).

I can honestly say that Mendy\u00c2\u2019s class was one of the absolute worst I have ever taken at Columbia.  As many of the other reviewers have said, his painful early morning lectures involve little more than loosely paraphrasing the plots of the novels or poetry, sharing a few of the same stupid anecdotes again and again (e.g. his young son attending an awkward junior high dance, or his infamous \u00c2\u201cScarsdale\u00c2\u201d story), pointing out a few passages that he again paraphrases and then drops completely, and picking one or two issues in the literature and beating them into the ground.  Is Tess a free individual, or mererly the subject of the whims of the cosmos?  Gee, I don\u00c2\u2019t know... but how about we spend three weeks on it!  And of course, no lecture would be complete without Mendelson stopping literally mid-sentence to single out (in front of a room of over one hundred) any student who may be slouching in his chair, tapping her pen, cracking his knuckles, or even laughing a bit too loudly.  Do yourself a favor: read these great books and poety on your own time, and stay as far away from this class as possible... especially if you happen to be from Scarsdale.\nWorkload:\nEmbarrassingly easy, and one of this class\u00c2\u2019s only perks: a few quick one-page assignments, two 3-4 page papers, and a straightforward final with ID\u00c2\u2019s and one essay.  Turn in all the annoying \u00c2\u201cintriguing problem\u00c2\u201d assignments (and he means it when he says he doesn\u00c2\u2019t even read them) and longer papers and you\u00c2\u2019ll be fine.  (He\u00c2\u2019ll also personally alert the registrar that you\u00c2\u2019re failing the course if you don\u00c2\u2019t turn them in, so be warned.)  He\u00c2\u2019s also telling the truth when he says he grades you only on what you do well.  I got an A- on the first paper, a B on the second, and left the final knowing I missed half the ID\u00c2\u2019s... and still got an A for the semester.  Go figure; oh Mendelson.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThe previous reviewer criticizes Prof. Mendelson's lectures as \"moralistic.\"  They are indeed moralistic, which is one of the reasons Mendelson is an excellent professor.  Unlike many humanities professors who seem incapable of forming coherent moral judgements, Mendelson will give his opinion about the moral implications of a work of literature.  His moral judgements are often surprising and challenging, you may not agree with all of them but they certainly deserve to be taken seriously.  In general, Mendelson's views of the literature you study in this course (Hardy, Conrad, Joyce, Woolf, Yeats, Auden, Eliot, Wilde) are nuanced, untraditional and challenging.  His understanding of Auden really seems to be top-rate (he is Auden's literary executor), this was a highlight.  His critique of how poetry is usually taught is both hilarious and right on the mark.  Yeats and Joyce he is perhaps not so strong on, but still very worth listening to.  (The way he teaches Yeats is radically different than how I had been taught Yeats before.  I wasn't entirely convinced of his point of view, but it was completely cogent and very interesting.)\nTwo previous reviewers complained that Mendelson is like a high-school teacher.  There seem to me to be three conclusions that you could draw from this:\n1. They didn't really understand his lectures.\n2. They went to a much better and more interesting high school than I did.\n3.  They were upset that Mendelson didn't indulge in the virtually meaningless post-modern jargon that many humanities profs seem to prefer.\nFrankly, the first explanation seems like the most likely to me.  If you are a rigid thinker, only willing to understand literature in terms of absolutes, his lectures will be of little value; as he once said in reference to a specific point he was making, \"It requires tact to understand this, but that doesn't mean it isn't right.\"  That quote describes most of Mendelson's understanding of literature.  I highly recommend him.\nWorkload:\nNot very heavy.  Significant, but not enormous readings.  Two four page papers and a final.  The grading is relatively easy.  I didn't study at all for the final and did fine.\n"

His moralistic lectures often put you to sleep at nine in the morning; his reading of the books is shallow enough to make you believe you're back to a high school setting. If you love literature and are serious about analyzing it, please save yourself time and mind and steer away from Mendelson. I should have dropped the class the moment he started analyzing Hardy's Tess D'urbervilles in the following way: Was it Tess's destiny that drove her to ...? Or was it really Tess herself that ...?

That is an accomplishment for any class.\n I think that those that call his class a \"cult\"  and believe that it is an insult to label it as \"moralistic\" were angry that he didn't tell us to kill ourselves or come to the conclusion that the world has no relevance but for those that understand fully the didactic and aesthetic constructs of Joyce's work.

Pen-clickers. Students whose laughter at his jokes goes beyond a \"slight chuckle.\" Ok, a little extreme but if he wants to shut them up too, fine. Quirkiness, not a problem. An endless supply of stories about his twelve-year-old son and the former student who supposedly said \"What does this have to do with me? I'm from Scarsdale!\", not a problem either. Sometimes even worth that slight chuckle. The problem is the broad, sweeping generalities. Now, if this is the way you like to interpret literature, by all means, take this class and you'll enjoy it. In fact, I highly recommend it. But if not, I'll give you a brief synopsis right here. Tess: is she an individual or a category? the product of outside forces or responsible for her own actions? raped or not? surprise surprise ALL OF THE ABOVE. Wilde: It's all about style. Conrad: Meaninglessness. Yeats: ideals, artificiality, myth, hint: he's winking at you. Joyce: conquering language. And Stephen's pretentious, so watch out. Eliot: we're isolated. the world is incoherent. Woolf: so Clarissa was originally supposed to die at the end. Auden: did you know that Mendelson is the proprietor of his estate? that's what I personally found to be the most interesting part of the Auden lectures. Ok, so you get the broad themes of modernism. I would have liked a little more.  And remember, don't slouch. \nWorkload:\nLight reading, 2 short papers, a final. That's all well and good. BUT who grades your papers? That's a mystery. Prof. Mendelson talks about staying up to finish grading them. I wonder how many he grades because neither of mine was graded by him. And he never bothered to introduce the TAs or tell us that we even had them. If he has so little respect for them, maybe they shouldn't be grading the papers. Especially not with such insighful comments as \"the plural of Tess is Tess' not Tess's. I mean, honestly, Prof. Mendelson is obviously a very intelligent, well-renowned guy and it would have been nice to know that he even glanced at my papers.\n"
