She's very happy and very nice and, though a few questions about special relativity threw her off a little bit, she was generally very on-point with material (especially in her area of specialty, neuroscience). She didn't do anything too fancy throughout the year, though FroSci has a fairly prescribed curriculum and I couldn't really expect her too. All in all, not too much to say here, she was a decent choice, can't complain.\nWorkload:\nSame as the other sections\n"
