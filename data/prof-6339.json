Class was all about going drinking afterward... we didn't learn as much vocab as I would have liked, so I paid a price for the easiness, but I got in the habit of hearing Spanish and working on grammar.  She does press you if you seem clueless, but if you pay attention in class you should be ok.  I hated the partner work but that comes with the territory of an elementary language class.\nWorkload:\na couple quizzes, a midterm and final given by the department.  Lorena gives some homeworks but not so much; attendance technically counts but she never recorded it and definitely didn't factor it into my grade.\n"
