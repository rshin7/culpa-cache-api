            "review_content": "\nAbsolutely amazing class. Although very challenging.\nShahriar is an absolutely amazing professor, he's a great lecturer and cares about his students actually learning the material. That said, there is a lot of material to learn in this class, which covers transitor-level amps and feedback. Most of the learning curve is building a familiarity and intuition with the material, and so it takes a ton of time. Even if it seems simple when he goes through an example in class (he makes it look ridiculously easy) you need to put in time outside of class.\nRight at the beginning Shahriar told the class that we needed to put in 20-30 hours a week in this class, and when we didn't believe him we all failed the midterm. So put it the time.\nHe was nice enough to weigh the second midterm and final more than the first, I don't think anyone actually failed the class although there were more than a few who dropped out.\nAltogether, an amazing class that simply takes a lot of work, taught by a an absolutely amazing prof.\nShahriar also has a video blog (thesignalpath.com) that has a few gems in it. He's great, one of the best professors I've ever had.\nWorkload:\n2 midterms and a final. Psets that aren't graded, but you'd best do them and redo all the examples from class if you want to understand the material. Lots of study time required.\n"
