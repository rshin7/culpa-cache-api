He is, in my opinion, not able to clarify anything that Professor Martin says, nor give his own examples. He talks softly and quickly, and it's difficult to understand him. Our discussion section would often let out early because we had nothing to say. He is a harsh grader, I think, and is pretty blunt in his comments. The good news about that is he will tell you in no small words exactly why you are wrong and what you need to improve. Don't get me wrong--the guy is no idiot. He can be funny, witty and engaging--just not about this topic.\nWorkload:\nHe will send questions in advance, but usually doesn't refer to them in-section. They are not especially helpful. Oh and a warning: he will try to guilt you if you haven't done the readings on time. \n"
