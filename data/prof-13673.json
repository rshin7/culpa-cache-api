The material could be a little slow/dry towards the beginning of the semester, but by the time we got through the midterm, I was fully riveted and really enjoyed the lectures. \nShe has you do a personal writing exercise (visual analysis) of an artwork at the beginning of every class and then lets people share their observations. There's no real pressure to participate, but it allows you the chance to prepare something to say and makes it a lot easier to participate if you feel a little nervous about speaking up in lecture. \nI never did the readings, and the only time I had to use them, I just pulled from the worksheets she gave us with excerpts from the assigned readings, which we sometimes went over in class in small groups.\nWorkload:\n2 papers, 1 midterm, 1 final (+ 1 museum trip) \n"
