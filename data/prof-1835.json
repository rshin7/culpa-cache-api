Even if you've worked on a proof for hours, he'll rarely give you any new insight to help you get going.  \"Have you tried some small examples?\" or \"Maybe you should look at it harder\" are standard repertoire.  \nWorkload:\nn/a\n"

I had a problem with my homework so I went to his office hours and his explanation was crystal clear. he even offered to help me via email and phone. I can count on him at any time because it seems as if he never sleeps. Anyway, go to his office hours. He is superb!!!!\nWorkload:\nN/A\n"
