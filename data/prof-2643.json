His exams are not easy, and you will need to work and go to the lecture (during which he gives many additional details). The extra credits I received from going to the Forum of Migration helped my grade a lot, which is useful since he doesn't curve the exams grades.. I definitely recommend taking his class, you will learn a lot and Prof. Moya is really funny!! \nWorkload:\nA lot of reading that I didn't always do and ended up been fine. One paper, one midterm (100 multiple choices), and a final (100 multiple choice + short answers) \n"

He posts them on CourseWorks, but GO TO CLASS because he has a lot of verbal additions to each power point and he's incredibly interesting so you should want to go his classes. He offers extra credit if you attend the Forum of Migration lectures. If you attend all in the semester, you can go up a full letter grade. I attended half and it DEFINITELY helped my grade a lot. There is no curve for any of the assignments. Readings are so-so, some are really interesting, some drag on, but overall I loved the material. I learned so much about humanity taking this class. Definitely recommend.\nWorkload:\nTwo 100 multiple choice question midterms, one 5-page essay and a final which consists of 50-70 multiple choice questions with an essay component (you're allowed to bring a 1-page 8x11\" cheat sheet to the exam).\n"

            "review_content": "\nI can't stress enough how fantastic Professor Moya is. He's incredibly engaging, funny, knowledgeable and a clear, concise lecturer. Reviews of this class had me terrified but to be honest, it wasn't too bad. Yes, the 2 midterms were 100 MCQs without a curve, which means you do need to know your stuff BUT he lectures so well and clearly that you know EXACTLY what you need to know. As long as you go to class and take notes on what he says and know his powerpoints (which he posts to Courseworks) you're golden. He gives extra credit if you attend his events and all you need to do is sign your name on a sheet to get the credit. It's simple AND it helps make up for the fact that he doesn't curve the exams. Reading was very very light and basically ceased towards the middle of the semester. You do however have to read a sizable chunk of his book, which is actually really interesting so it's not even too bad. There's also 1 5-page paper on any topic of your choice. \nOverall, I'd say take the class. It was really interesting and there wasn't a single moment where I wasn't completely focused on the material. Professor Moya is fabulous and hysterical. He's incredibly smart and interesting to talk to. Definitely go to office hours.\nWorkload:\n2 midterms, 100 MCQs each, 1 5-page paper, a final that wasn't cumulative (only on the lectures not covered by the 2nd midterm and 4 essay questions given in advance, 3 on the exam, 1 of which you had to do. A 1-sided cheat sheet was allowed)\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis is the first Culpa review I write and the following is going to be said because I think the reviews for this class are enormously misleading. \nFor starters, yes, Moya is a very enderaing professor. He is humorous, kind, and always adds interesting anecdotes to his lectures. He is also very informed on the subject matter (as is attested through his book Cousins and Strangers). With that said however, I certainly would not consider him the best lecturer I have had. The class is essentially the professor reading/paraphrazing his lecture notes. When the lecture notes are so easily available online, it becomes difficult to concentrate in class and feel motivated to attend (though I have attended each class to date). \nA comment on the lecture notes: they are far too detailed. The notes focus on dates, names, and facts as opposed to larger concepts and ideas. This is the only class I have taken in college that has so greatly emphasized what I would consider trivial items. \nFinally, a comment on the midterm: it was 100 questions of multiple choice that basically asked you for these small details. For a person who has never taken a class on latin america I found it pretty difficult. I also felt all the time I spent studying (and I spent a whole lot of time studying) what I deemed as important concepts had gone to waste.Surprise: the class average was a 75. \nMost of the reviews on this page state this is an easy and relaxing class. I took this class with these expectations in mind. \nThis will be the first class I pass/fail in all my time here. This was a big mistake.  \nWorkload:\nmidterm/final 100qs + a book review \n"

            "review_content": "\nThe previous reviews for this class (or what seems to have been a similar version to this class) remark on how Moya is an incredible professor but you shouldn't take the class because of another professor who co-taught it. Thankfully, that professor is no longer teaching this course with Moya, but I still can't say I enjoyed my time in this class.\nMoya himself is a wonderful, charming man with an interesting life story and a fondness for going off on tangents. I was at first in love with the class, but I realized it was only because I enjoyed hearing him speak so much. Also, because there was literally no homework. No readings, no textbook, all the PowerPoints online. Sounds great, right?\nUnfortunately, not so much. Without readings and a textbook, the classes was incredibly unfocused. The lectures consisted of a series of statistics on immigration to Latin America. This country was the top destination for the Chinese. This country was the second-top destination for the Chinese. Or, there was a slave revolt in this year, and another one in this year. Seems like the kind of stuff that you usually avoid writing in your notes because it's not the big picture. Or if you do write it down, you don't write down every single number, just the main ideas (e.g. these three countries sent a lot of people to Brazil). Well, then the 100-question, multiple-choice midterm arrived, and I had no idea how to study. I reviewed my notes but was at a loss because most of them consisted of these statistics. I decided just to go for it having reread the lectures and committed the big concepts to memory. It turned out that at least 75% of the test were sentences or data from the PowerPoints rephrased as questions. Some of them stood out in my mind because we had dwelled on them for more than a minute. Others (like the meaning of an obscure Aztec word that I tossed off as a charming bit of irrelevant trivia) didn't. As a result, the midterm was curved heavily (I think my 82 became an 89).\nThe rest of the semester proceeded in the same, somewhat dull fashion. On principle I hate cutting class, but as a non-morning person who lived quite far from the building, and knowing that literally everything I needed to know would be in the lectures online, I often slept through it.\nI don't feel like I really learned all that much about Latin American migration. I could tell you some very general things which I probably had also learned in high school history classes, and a handful of statistics that have stuck with me, but not much else. There were very few overarching connections that we made.\nWe purchased two books for the class, one by Moya, and I'm pretty sure they were mentioned once. (Possible that it was a lecture I missed, but still, other than being potential essay topics on the final\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsee below\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey were never relevant.) One of the books was basically an encyclopedia of statistics on Latinos in the U.S.\nThe final was 100 multiple-choice questions again, plus one essay. He gave us three potential topics ahead of time, he put two on the test, you wrote one. On top of all that, you could (very generously) bring in two pages of data and outline. Of the three topics, one was on slavery (with hints telling us to go to the only assigned reading we had all semester for our evidence), another was on one chapter of his book, and the other asked us to discuss various statistics in all the charts and tables in the other book, which I simply wrote down on my outline and transcribed on the final.\nMost incredible part of the whole course: Moya ran six lectures across the semester as part of Barnard's Forum on Migration. If you went to four, your grade was bumped up by 1/3. They lasted an hour and they served food and wine. They were actually quite interesting, too. But no response paper, no discussion posting, nothing required\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust sign your name on the mailing list.\nWorkload:\nNo readings, except two books that we never discussed. Certainly no nightly/weekly readings.\n1 midterm (30%), 100 multiple-choice questions, based entirely on lectures\n1 5-7 paper (30%), on a topic of your choosing, graded by an invisible TA (who was actually quite fair in the grading, but still\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit's nice to know who's grading your paper)\n1 final (40%), 100 multiple-choice questions, once again based entirely on lectures, plus 1 essay (topics ahead of time)\n"

            "review_content": "\nWhy does Professor Moya not have a gold nugget yet? His class was one of the best I've taken at Columbia. If you want to get a good idea of what Professor Moya looks like/acts like, Google \"The Most Interesting Man in the World - Dos Equis\". It seems that the beer company studied Moya down to the last detail for inspiration: the beard, the exotic accent, the fantastic life story. According to his UCLA bio (he used to teach at UCLA before taking a full professorship at Barnard, although this class is technically a Columbia course), he was born in socialist Cuba, moved to Franco's Spain, then immigrated to the USA, where he worked as a truck driver and janitor before getting his PhD and becoming one of the foremost experts in his field.\nMoya's knowledge of Latin American history is extensive and his delivery impeccable. In writing the course book - Cousins and Strangers: Spanish Immigrants in Buenos Aires, 1850-1930, Moya conducted primary research on shipping manifolds, census records, and more creative sources like collections of Spanish plays and poems. This deep knowledge of his subject material is evident in his lectures, which are incredibly entertaining to boot.\nLast semester, Moya and Barnard College were also hosting the Forum on Migration, in which experts from universities across the globe came to speak and hold discussions with Moya and each other. I am not sure whether he was trying to motivate us to witness the entertaining and edifying discussions or whether he just wanted a good audience for the talks, but Prof. Moya gave us one extra credit point on our final grade for each lecture we attended. It was the most astounding display of extra credit I have ever witnessed - after attending four lectures my grade was raised from a borderline A to an A+. I don't know if extra credit like this is typical for Moya's classes, but I'll take whatever I can get...\nWorkload:\n100 multiple choice question midterm (30%), 5 page book report on Cousins and Strangers (30%), 100 multiple choice question + one essay final (40%)\n"

The negatives: McKeown's incomprehensible lectures, the unhelpful TAs, and the horrific and impossible exams. \nTake anything you can with Prof Moya, but NOT this class. Even his superior teaching does not balance out the stress caused by the negatives. Previous reviews say that this course is an easy 'A,' which is completely beyond me. Most people I talked to took this class P/D/F, and STRUGGLED to pass! Studying for exams is difficult because McKeown's notes and lectures (which comprise about 1/2 of the material and therefore 1/2 of the exam questions) are pretty much useless. I remember sitting in his lectures, pen in hand, attempting to take some worthwhile notes down, and leaving class with a blank sheet.\nBottom line: this class is completely overrated.\nWorkload:\nMidterm and an exam - both IMPOSSIBLE and probably should have been curved, but were not. 1 paper that I think is graded fairly, but does not balance out the horrors of the 2 exams.

Prof Moya started out the first lecture guzzling water from a student's Nalgene bottle, joking about spanish cartoons and a trying to draw maps of south america on the board that didn't really resemble, well, anything. So... he's new, he's quality and he's AWESOME! I promise you, you will never look at history quite the same way after his class. What used to be considered a dull, dry subject comes alive with his jokes, bizzare but hilarious comments, quirks (i.e. his personal obsession with UNESCO world heritage sites) and occasional yet endearing english slip-ups, i.e. \"adding salt to injury\" instead of \"insult to injury\", \"de-bat\" instead of \"dee-bate\" etc. Only a minor detail though, his english is phenomenal and he has no impeding accent, probably because of the 500 pg book he authored about immigration in argentina. \nHe takes questions in class, ranging from nit-picking pre-law students looking to fufill there \"outside their concentration\" history class requirement to recommendations about surfing in Puerto Rico (no, seriously). but the class is structured pretty well, so it's pretty much a straightforward lecture. Its so good that most people actually come to every lecture, even though it's a 9am class. my advice is take it, take it, take it! \nWorkload:\nDef go to class because he's that good... and take good notes because the readings are short, but reallyyyy dense and overly detailed. \nA note on testing: he does the high school grading thing, where the test is designed so you get most of the answers right (i.e. not science, where you pass with 15% correct and get a massive curve). He's using the 90 = A range, 80 = B range at the moment... so study up. 2 multiple choice midterms, 1 5-7 pg paper, 1 final. Keep up with it, but you don't need to kill yourself over it. \n"
