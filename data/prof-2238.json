The problem sets are 1-4 questions based upon old midterm and final questions (which means that there are no surprises on the tests). His lectures follow the class notes almost exactly, but that's not a bad thing. My one complaint is that he periodically mumbles into the blackboard, but that doesn't happen more than 1x or 2x a lecture for about a phrase.\nWorkload:\nPset every week (1-4 problems), based upon old midterms and finals\n2 midterms and 1 Final (no notes)\n"
