He was approachable and lenient and understanding when it came to deadlines.  Jesse rarely returned anything on time.  However, it was worth the wait in order to get back his excellent comments.  Although the seminar tended to be more of a lecture based class, he welcomed comments from students.  He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem all that comfortable with a discussion-based class perhaps because he feared silence.\n\nWorkload:\nSame as any First Year English class: two 3-5 page papers (rough and final drafts) and a research paper of 8-10 pages.  Reading varied depending on the week but was always doable.\n"

Jess is approachable, sharp, and - after the first few rather tense class sessions - rather funny. Best of all, he gives unbeatable advice about writing the academic establishment. Fair (but not necessarily lenient) grader.\nWorkload:\nSame stuff everybody does for UW. \n"
