She genuinely cared about her students and tried absurdly hard to help everyone understand the material. She went far out of her way to be available to all students in the class (not just in her discussion section). She definitely saved my paper (which was worth 35% of my grade) and probably about 30 others. Alex was incredible, i think I'm in love with her.\n"
