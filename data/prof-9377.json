Really humorous and clearly cares about and is passionate about the subject material; he does his best to bring out different students' opinions during recitation and covers all the important points. He is also on your side - he helped extend deadlines with our paper and takehome final and will often do outside reading to send a debriefing email or followup piece to you. \n"
