He speaks deliberately, sporadically, cryptically, droningly--though with a charming demeanor, a dry, facile wit, and enormous brilliance. The requirements of the class almost make up for the lack of classroom pep: just one term paper. If you're really into the content, his anecdotes, asides and sheer acuity will redeem the in-class incarceration.\nWorkload:\none paper, 20 pages.\n"
