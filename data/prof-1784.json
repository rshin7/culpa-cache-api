He KNOWS everything there is to know about the materials he's working with or his students could potentially be working with. Today we had a discussion about Lord of the Rings while he helped us with our final projects. Now I'm a powertooling queen. \nYou want an indept survey course, he's your guy. Wood, Metal, Plaster, Wax, Clay - you name he's got it and there's lots of room for individual ideas.\nWorkload:\nAn assignment for each medium but it varies and you can interchange materials\n"
