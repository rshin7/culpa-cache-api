            "review_content": "\nAvoid him like the plague.  He makes a seemingly easy 1 credit course into a nightmare.  He can't speak clear english, you never know what he expects from you on each lab even if you talk to him one on one, and you never know why you got the grade that you did.  He seems to give grades at random and never explains how and why you got a 3.5/5 whereas your buddy got a 3/5.  This means that you don't know how to improve from one week to another because the expectations are always unclear and vague.  \nEvery week at least 1 pissed off student tried arguing with him over his retarded grading method but failed miserably.  His grading is very harsh and chances are you won't get an A (Most of the class doesn't) in the class.\nEmail the department and ask which TA you have been assigned to before the first week of class, if it's him, ask for a change or you'll end up pissed off and depressed for weeks to come.\nWorkload:\nLab report to be handed in at the end of the class if only you can figure out what he wants you to write in it.  A single word could mean the difference between a 3 and a 4.  He's that anal.\n"
