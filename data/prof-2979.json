My dad couldn't understand why I would take this course - he even asked if I would do basket weaving next, but after the semester he retracted that and was amazed at how much my voice improved.  Josephine is very helpful and is always available for extra help.  While you certainly learn a lot, the class is also nice because you have such a nice, relaxed atmosphere where you just sing and learn how to improve.  \nWorkload:\nIts what you make of it.  There are readings, but you're not going to be penalized for not doing them.  You are supposed to meet with the TA pianist a few times a month, but how often you do is up to you.  I went at least once a week, but that was because I wanted to (and the TA was the best I could have hoped for).  Your grade is based on 2 reports - a concert and a master class - both about 3-5 pages long (not a big deal), as well as your class participation.  There is also a final performance which is fun and you can invite your friends/family.  It's a cute end to the semester.  Actually, the real end was when Josephine had us over for lunch during readin week (she's a good cook too - she used to teach cooking!).  This is an easy class grade wise, but if you put more time into it, you will see the rewards.  \n"
