            "review_content": "\nProfessor Schorsch is a scholar of the highest order whose dedication to his subject and students ought to be evident to any who takes this course.  His style is passionate and well-informed par excellence.  Any student with even the slightest interest in Judaism, philosophy, or general intellectualism will find fantastic outlets for those interests in this course.\nThe course's thesis is deliberately general--how have different thinkers responded to Judaism's confrontation with modernity philosophically, historically, sociologically, theologically, etc.--such as to allow students to project their own interests onto the course's trajectory.  Professor Schorsch is always open to questions, and his extensive knowledge of all things academically Jewish makes his insights highly valuable.  The course is discussion-based, so student participation is welcomed and understood as an essential component to cultivating understanding.  The texts used in this course are highly stimulating (of course that is a subjective valuation, but I don't think it's so farfetched) and I, as well as others whose interest was evident from their comments, certainly appreciated the opportunity to come to class and talk about our reactions rather than simply listen to Prof. Schorsch lecture, even though that is a stimulating activity in itself.\nThis course is a fair amount of work, both in terms of volume and the often impenetrable nature of its content.  If you're looking for an easy A, take another class.  But if you possess an earnest curiosity, or even a modicum of interest in the subject, this is where you want to be.  You will learn tremendously under the auspices of a fantastic, compelling lecturer and walk away with knowledge that will infiltrate many aspects of your life in ways that those other \"easier\" classes never will.  This is a far cry from a B-S lecture offering cursory overviews that will ultimately leave you hardly informed of the material.  Jewish or not (because this course assumes very little prior knowledge), the ambitious student will leave this course understanding exactly why he or she came to Columbia--to learn from the best and cultivate a genuine thirst for knowledge.\nWorkload:\nThe work for this course is voluminous, but there is very little expectation that one do all of it all of the time.  Professor Schorsch constructs his syllabus with care, complete with \"recommended readings\" that assist in further research on a particular topic, to be undertaken at one's leisure.  One can get by with having only done some of the reading, but it is rare that one will even want to do any less than the full assignment.  That said, assignments can range from 50-200 pages per class period, which can be a challenge to complete.  If you can do even a portion, though, you will have enough of a grounding to participate and Prof. Schorsch will be more than happy to fill in gaps.  No calling anybody out, so the environment is conducive to open discussion.\nThere are three three-page biography assignments that allow students to do their own research on any thinker who is \"modern\" and \"Jewish\" (which is a very broad burden).  The assignments are interesting and serve well their purpose in acquainting students with the thought of a particular figure, either one treated on the syllabus or not.  There is also a 10-page final paper on a topic of the student's choice.  It is unlikely that a student who takes the course seriously will be at a loss of ideas for what to write about.\nGrading is 100% fair--not too easy, but you will get what you deserve given your effort, skills, and interest.  Getting an A is possible if you put in the requisite work along the way.  Schorsch always gives extensive comments on returned assignments that are helpful and indicate the care he takes with his students' work, a sign of respect that is refreshing compared to some other class experiences.\n"

            "review_content": "\nIn contrast to the many negative reviews, which unfairly paint Professor Schorsch in a negative light, Professor Schorsch is one of the more knowledgeable and approachable professors on campus. I cover the specifics of his courses more in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Workload\u00e2\u20ac\u009d section. In general, though, he is more than willing to answer student questions, encourages discussion, holds frequent office hours, and always answers e-mails promptly. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had professors that were absolutely impossible to get in contact with, so it is a refreshing change of pace to have one actively encourage it and willing to elucidate any topic you did not understand in class or discuss related topics not covered in the general syllabus.\nWorkload:\nIn terms of workload, Professor Schorsch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s courses are about the same as other classes at Columbia University. Actual written assignments that need to be handed in are actually less numerous than in most other classes. Usually they consist of 2-3 very small papers (3-5 pp each) and 1 longer paper (10-15 pp) due at the end of the semester instead of a final exam. 20-25 pp total a semester is not much in comparison to other courses where I easily had to write around 50-60 pp over the course of the semester in addition to having a final exam. Additionally, if you have a problem and contact him, he is usually flexible and is more than willing to offer advice on suggested reading and finding sources for your paper topic.\nReading assignments each week can be slightly above average in length compared to other courses at Columbia. However, they are not insanely long as some other reviews would like to claim. When combined with the amount of reading an average student generally has to do each week throughout all their courses, the amount can seem overwhelming. However, Professor Schorsch never puts someone on the spot and understands that students are very busy and may be unable to completely read an assignment sometimes. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found that even if this is the case, generally reading what little of the assignment you can is sufficient to still partake in the class discussion due to Professor Schorsch being more than willing to answer student questions. One negative is that total textbook cost can run higher than most classes. Professor Schorsch, however, encourages, students to find the text books cheaper online (and often the books are not required till a few weeks into the semester--with the first few readings online--to give students time to acquire the books).\n"

Moreover, when he does not know something, he freely admits that he is unsure and researches the topic for next class (this is unfortunately not the case with most professors.)\nThe assigned readings are long and not very interesting, but the truth (and this is pretty true for any college course) is that you don't need to read everything.\nThe class is at its best when there is discussion. Professor Schorsch delights in students asking questions and actively encourages participation. Without class participation, Professor Schorsch will lecture non-stop. My suggestion to those who have trouble focusing is to start a class discussion. You can make the class better, but it requires doing some reading and asking the right questions.\nThe papers are not difficult. The topic is very broad allowing you to choose what interests you most. He is a fair grader, but he expects a high level of performance (which considering the small amount of work, it's fair for him to ask that you put in some effort.)\nFinally, I want to echo the sentiment most of the reviews have expressed which is that he is a truly great person. He will make time for you and go out of his way to help you. I really recommend getting to know him.\nWorkload:\nThree 3-5 page biographies and one final research paper (10-15 pages.)\nWeekly readings (but you don't have to read everything.)\n"

Some read the material in the class while he was giving his lecture, some just gave up.\nI do want to mention that he was very flexible with students' personal interest and was open to (virtually) any subject that is somehow related to judaism. In addition, he encouraged class discussion which is a very important part of such class.\n\nWorkload:\nThree biographies (around 3-4 fages each), one major final paper (7-10 pages).

Most of the class stopped doing the reading maybe after the third week. He assumes you have done the reading, and so maybe the class would have been interesting if I had done it, but it wasn't during those first three weeks for me, and I think most of my classmates voted the same with their feet. Only maybe half the class showed up most of the time, and probably of that half most were on facebook through the class because really, it is 100% unengaging. The syllabus listed attendance as 10% of the grade, but he never took role and there had to be too many people in the class for him to keep track in his head. \nTo his credit: \n-He did stop for questions/discussion at the end of each lecture but questions were barely ever asked, which is sad because it seemed like he really wanted to hear what we had to say. Too bad he didn't realize nobody was responding because we had no idea what the hell he had been talking about. \n-He seems completely happy to talk to anyone in office hours/after class. \n-He smiles a lot and makes cute jokes. \nWorkload:\nWeekly reading is heavy, but you don't actually need to do any of it at all. \nPapers-three 3pg biographies, two 5pg research papers, one take-home final which I haven't taken yet... so maybe you do need to do the readings though they haven't been necessary so far. \n"

There were only about twelve students in the class and Professor Schorsch didn't really know how to get the students involved in the discussion. The class focused on the Jewish text, \"Ethics of the Fathers,\" one of the most interesting and discussion-worthy texts, yet every class, no one had a thing to say. I do not blame this on the material. The professor has no idea how to engage a discussion. Often, the class was painfully awkward. He had us write these ridiculous biographies that \"were not allowed to be about the commentator's life.\" I am still unclear as to what this means. The grading on it seemed to be pretty random. He seemed to give a lot of B+ and A-'s. I was never excited to go to this class because I knew that it was going to be awkward. Worst part about it: there is no wireless connection in the classroom.

We focused in one the one text (Pirkei Avot/Ethics of the Fathers) and studied it using different rabbinic commentaries, and each class we discussed only a small portion of the text.  Professor Schorsch is a sweetheart and he does seem to know everything.  He doesn't really care if you hand in papers late, as long as he gets them at some point.  This includes the final research paper.  He responds well to emails and is happy to meet with students outside of class.  He has a tendency to do all the talking, though that might have been a function of a general lack of engagement on the students' part (it was also a reaction to our general lack of engagement).  The issue was that there were few threads throughout the semester to tie the text together as a whole, and so a lot of our discussions ended up feeling pedantic or pointless (whether we discussed as an entire class or in small groups).  It's hard to tell how much I've actually learned this semester, but my guess is that that means that I didn't learn all that much.  \nThis class is very easy, but if you don't go into it already engaged in rabbinical texts in some way, it can be dull and confusing.  Speaking/reading Hebrew is a plus, but it is in no way required, and not speaking it really didn't hold me back.  \nWorkload:\n4 mini-papers (biographies of rabbis we encountered in the text), 4-5 pages each.  1 final research paper, 10 pages.

Schorsch knows freaking everything on the subject (he wrote a book about it) but he continually stresses the same core questions regardless of what particular aspect of the Inquisition we were focusing on. Schorsch is extremely friendly and very laid back and is very helpful about finding research topics and materials. He will often refuse to give a straight answer to questions, which is probably more truthful than just making broad generalizations but is also frustrating when you just want to hear a distillation of the material and he refuses to give you his opinion. All in all, a very good course to take if you are interested in the subject and want to hear from an eminent scholar in the field, but it will be a bit tedious at times. \nWorkload:\nA 1 page response to the reading per week. These are not graded, but he will return them (eventually) with comments. There is a serious amount of reading. On average it is about 3\\4 of a book or 6-8 articles per week. There is no midterm nor final but there is a 10-15 page paper at the end that is basically your entire grade for the semester. \n"

The title of this course says it all: explorations, as this class was a haphazard adventure through Hasidism, both the scholarly perspectives and Hasidic perspectives from within.  Schorsch assigned about fifty pages of reading for each class, which were either never available on Courseworks due to \u00c2\u201ctechnical reasons\u00c2\u201d (and a lazy T.A.), or rarely read by more than a handful of students in the class.  It\u00c2\u2019s OK, as if not even to expect students read them in the first place, he summarizes them in class anyway!  Yet, he will catch you if you pretend like you did the reading - at times he answered idiocy with sarcastic or satirical retorts.\nSchorsch\u00c2\u2019s humor and witticisms are like an oasis in an endless desert of humdrum lecturing.  There were a few students in the class who seemed to contribute to the class discussion from only their own personal agendas, be it feminist, or otherwise, yet Schorsch was determined to face the controversial issues head on (including relationship to Christianity, women, hypocricy, etc\u00c2\u2026).  We even discussed smoking, alcoholism, \"neo-Hasidism,\" music, and other interesting topics in Hasidism.\n\nWorkload:\nThe workload was fair.  One 2-page original Hasidic analysis of any passage in the Bible, one 5-page ethnographic analysis of a Hasidic event (he was flexible with requirements), and one 10-page research paper on any topic pertaining to Hasidism.

I remember on the first day of class, this kid told me that \"Schorsch is a push-over, and you won't hear anything brilliant from him\". If that kid was still in this class, he'd be taking those words back. Sure, Schorsch does allow discussion to meander once in a while, and does allow students to make irrelevant remarks which he'll often quip back with \"right\". But he is indeed a brilliant teacher, and makes many many insightful comments about the books we read. Maybe you won't appreciate him that much in the first semester because the works aren't really that interesting. But once you hit the modern texts, that's where he unleashes his real powers. The great thing about Schorsch is that you can tell that when he teaches, he is Schorsch himself and doesn't put on any pretentious, arrogant front like other obnoxious CC teachers. He'll joke about his kids, 5 to be precise, and often make fun about his Jewish identity (which makes him very endearing). Honestly, if you want a \"hardcore\" CC class that is jammed-packed with details on a very intensed level, that stay away from him. But if you're just looking to take away one or two insightful points from each book after every class, and don't want any of that \"class-presentation BS\" (which is a bloody waste of time), then Schorsch is your man. \nWorkload:\nMedium. Just the basic readings (which is minimal as compared to other classes), 2-3 essays per semester. But be warned, he is a tough grader on the essays. 1 Midterm.

It is likely that students just found the material dull, and I guess I can't say that Schorsch was successful in making the students love the material. But I'm fairly convinced that people didn't read the material in the first place. How can people expect to find discussion riveting when they didn't do the reading? Anyway, if there weren't previous posts on Culpa saying that Schorsch is poor at running discussion, I would have totally attributed the lack of good discussion in class to the students. As it is, I'll say that Schorsch is a very good professor who just happens to teach an early morning section that doesn't have very many interested students and isn't able to wake them from their collective stupors.  Schorsch is pretty historical in his methodology. He likes talking about the political and social contexts of works, which some find fascinating and others find deadly boring. The few times students got excited about material is when he really applied arguments to current events. Like \"What do you all think about Britney Spears\"-type questions.\nHe's also very nice and approachable.

While the readings are occasionally interesting, they are completely disconnected and useless.  The class itself, in fact, has no coherent theme, the lectures are mostly summaries of the books with some discussion, and the essays are completely superfluous.

In her words, \"what did he think he was going to test you on?\"  Schorsch is new in the religion department, he's actually a historian, and in my opinion he had no business teaching a class on Religions and the Modern World.
