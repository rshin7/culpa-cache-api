Sarah was painfully patient answering irrelevant questions and listening to personal stories that students felt to share with the entire class in order to get recognition or just hear themselves talk. There seems to be some complaining from people that they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t copy the notes down fast enough but she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave a ton of information off from the sides on CourseWorks  - maybe she has changed it up a bit, but the slides weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mostly blank for us. Most definitions were missing but the words to define were there so you could Google it later if you missed something. \nGo to class, take down the missing notes, memorize the definitions of the terms she spoon feeds you with on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exam final review,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and read her summaries on the slides about the papers. Do this and then be able to apply some of the concepts to parallel examples and you are good to go.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a neuro major so maybe I had more background on some of the concepts than others in the class and thought this would be a fun class for the psych requirement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why people were say the class was hard. The majority of topics were covered in intro classes if you put a decent amount of work into the class you can get an A. \nSarah is a entertaining lecturer and seems super cool. She is not out to fail you- she wants everyone to do well but she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want you to just completely regurgitate information back at her on the exams. \n\nWorkload:\n2 midterms and a final. Weekly papers and readings but you don't have to read them before class - just before the exams.\n"

            "review_content": "\n   I really hate writing negative reviews, but I feel obligated to my fellow students to share my experience with the class and professor so that they can made wise decisions when registering. I found the text and a few of the papers to be interesting, and Professor Woolley does seem funny and is excited about the material but overall I would not recommend this class or this professor to another student. The Lecture slides are posted but the important parts are left blank on the slides posted to Courseworks. If she was mad that students didn't show up to lecture, why not just take attendance? It's a horrible tactic because instead of trying to understand the material or enjoying the professor's lecture, everyone is scrambling at break-neck speed to copy the points in red on the slide. She rushes through complicated material and concepts (like Hamilton's Law) without taking the time to help you understand the material. Each lecture is a disorganized knowledge dump and many of the concepts presented are controversial and abstract. We were lucky enough to have a great TA who would take time out to help us with the material, but don't make the mistake of thinking this professor cares if you understand or wants you to succeed in this class. \nWorkload:\nBasically teach yourself.  If you want to do well, your going to have to put allot of time into this class. In the end you don't really learn anything useful. The papers use circuitous methods (and often abusive to animals) to come to anthropomorphic and intuitive conclusions, so they're painful to read. 3 exams filled with confusing and contradictory questions that are graded harshly and irreversibly. \n"

I am sure this is a great way to fulfill the science requirement, and by far the most interesting class I have taken.\nWorkload:\n2 midterms and a final, can be difficult if you do not study.\nmake sure to pay attention when Professor Woolley summarizes the papers you read in class, as they will show up on the tests!\ngo to office hours of TAs and Professor to ask about papers if you do not understand them!\n"

            "review_content": "\nI've taken both Animal Behavior and Auditory Perception with Professor Woolley.  She is without a doubt the best, funniest and most interesting Prof I've had at Columbia.  If you don't like science and reading about fun science facts you won't like this class, but if you like weird stories and making animal noises then you'll absolutely love it.  Studying for the tests did not feel like studying at all, it was like reading a book you'd actually want to read in your free time.  Don't be fooled by this- both of her courses were among the hardest I have taken.  Auditory perception, in particular, terrified our entire class until we got the midterm back.  I hardly understood anything and studied 24/7 for a few weeks for the midterm.  But hard work actually pays off in this class and you'll learn a lot, if you are willing to put in the hours. I feel like I actually can converse about electrophysiology now. Everyone, even the students in my class that didn't like the material and were doing badly, loved Prof Woolley speak.  She is HILARIOUS and I totally disagree with the previous posts that she puts no effort into being a professor- the fact that she puts up versions of her slides without notes actually must take a lot of extra work, she has to make two copies of everything and she does it for the benefit of her students who SHOULD come to lecture.  Professor Wooley is intelligent, sophisticated, composed, and no-nonsense- exactly what any scientist or non-scientist should aspire to be!  Lazy people shouldn't take her classes because she is full of energy- every class meeting IS like a marathon, but in a really, really good way.  You'll leave exhilarated, smarter and motivated to be just like her! \nWorkload:\n3 exams for animal. A LOT OF NOTE TAKING.  A lot of studying. 1 midterm and 1 paper for Auditory Perception (midterm not as scary as it seems, but requires prep work and a good study group).\n"

The class focuses on some nitty-gritty details of the behavior of somewhat dull animals, like insects, but I found it fascinating. The class is mainly a study of the evolutionary history of behavior. The one complaint I would have is that her use of slides during lecture often slows down the pace and takes ages to write down.  \nThe first exam was graded harshly (with an actual average of a C/C-). People were outraged about this, but the averages went up as the course went on. Be prepared to study a lot for the exams, which are open-ended.\nWorkload:\nTwo midterms, one final. \n"

I understand why the professor wants us to write so many notes, but I disagree with this method. If we don't have the internal motivation to learn the material, forcing us to write it will be painful. She wanted us to understand the concepts and then take abridged notes on this. But what if you're still trying to understand the concept, and then she changes the slide? You miss the concept, plus have no notes, plus miss the next concept and notes. Woolley is very mentally quick and focused, but for me, class is regularly a marathon race. I don't mind a marathon class, but I would like to have some notes to take home so that I can in my own time take the time to understand the concepts.\nWorkload:\n3 tests, including the final. No multiple choice, all explanatory answers. Reading: text and experiment studies that are detailed.\n"

            "review_content": "\nDO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FOR ANY REASON (unless you are a wild animal, been raised by wild animals, or plan on becoming a wild animal!!! This differs from the last review because Woolley was upset that her previous semesters nobody came to class. Therefore she posts minimal information on the slides and you are expected to take the (large amount) of supplemental information on the slides. Then she goes too fast to let you copy the notes and is convinced that it should not take as long because you can paraphrase the notes (she thinks). I don't know if she knows this but is hard to paraphrase scientific terms. And if she says copy the main idea, she tests you on the details.\nFurthermore, the tests are terribly worded and therefore many, many, many points are taken off because you did not write something that she did not actually ask for. And if you write her an email or go talk to her in any way, she dismisses you as being stupid or unreasonable, without even listening to your misunderstanding or clarification.\nIt is a shame she puts no effort into being a professor because the material is somewhat interesting. However, every day I left class frustrated that I could not get all the notes and that she did not listen to any needs of her students. For a professor of a class not to be there for her students is despicable and she is by far the worst and most careless teacher I have had at Columbia so far. \nWorkload:\n3 tests (grading does not make any sense)textbook reading that isn't necessaryexperimental papers that are important but interestingexercise your hand before class\n"

            "review_content": "\nSummary of review: -Positives: Interesting Material, Slides and Lecture are great\n-Negatives: Prof. doesn't post all the info on the slides, test questions are sometimes unclear\n-Advice: 1. I would suggest that the whole class convince her to put the information on the slides. I think that if the majority of students said that they would not skip class that she would agree to post more of the information. I also really hope that she reads this review. 2. Concentrate on the slides and especially on the central concepts. Memorize at least one example, usually provided on the slides, of each term.  3. Study with other people-always makes things easier for me. \nMaterial: The animal behavior material is very interesting. \n1. You learn about evolution, the relationship between instinct and learning,  the effect of development on and the neural control of behavior, and also animal communication, reproduction, parental care, and social behavior. \n2. You pick up many interesting facts about animals such as: how orb weaver spiders kill themselves after mating, or  some moths have evolved ears to be able to either ward off or detect the ultrasounds of bat's echolocation.\n3. You get to the see the scientific method at work. It's amazing some of the experiments that scientists have come up with in order to  learn more about animal behavior and its causes. \nSlides: Professor Wooley's slides are great: that is if you can get a copy with all the notes already written in. When I took the class, she took a lot of the material out of the slides to convince people to go to class. This made most of class a frantic struggle to copy down the information on the slides. It would be much better if she continued to give the students the completed slides. Professors concerned about some people not coming to class should not take it out all the students by hurting their learning process. \nLectures: Prof. Woolley is clear when she lectures-if you aren't putting all your attention on copying down the slides.\nReview Session: The review sheet she gives us  is great. It has all the things that you definitely need to know. Usually the review session isn't very useful, but that's because most of the students don't ask any questions. \nTests: The tests are not really that hard if you've studied the slides and at least skimmed the reading, but admittedly, though she probably won't admit it, sometimes the questions are a little unclear. \n\nWorkload:\n3 Tests, reading from the book,which is great though at time dense textbook, and reading from published experiments which is very dense. She summarizes the experiments you need to know, so that reading isn't crucial. \n"

Woolley is a fabulous prof., she is very clear and thorough in her explanations of all of the topics, and has remarkably organized powerpoints that she posts online in case you can't make a class. These slides are so good that you hardly have to take notes in class, although I don't recommend skipping class all the time because class is actually pretty enjoyable. I actually looked forward to going to this class and was upset when I couldn't go -- which I know is a little weird. The material of the class is fascinating, and Woolley loves to show the humor of animal behavior. She often makes bird sounds and other miscellaneous explicatory gestures that are really funny. \nPlus, her exams are generally very fair -- she has a \"review session\" the class before each exam where she has slides with every term you'll need to know in order to succeed on the test. This makes it really easy to study and prep. All in all, this is a great class, and I highly recommend this and any class that Woolley might teach in the future!\nWorkload:\nTwo midterms and a final -- no papers. Some reading, which usually is skimmable or not necessary to your success. \n"
