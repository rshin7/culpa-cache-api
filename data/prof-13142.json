Professor regularly referenced his lack of concern for the curriculum or assignments, but assigned the same work anyway. It was hard to care when he didn't seem to himself. Save yourself the trouble and take a Music Hum that feels more standardized like the rest of him. Taking this class means you better hope you get along with the professor or your heavily subjective grade in the class will suffer. \nClasses were generally boring and not especially worth attending. \nWorkload:\nBlog posts, 3 Essays, Pop quizzes to check attendance. Not fun\n"
