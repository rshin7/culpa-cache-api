She does not insult your writing in the class, mostly outside her class, and you'll probably feel the negative criticism. If you want to build your confidence in writing, don't register for this class.  She has her favorites and if your her favorite great, and if your not, good luck. The students comments and advice were more of a help than this teacher.\nWorkload:\nMeet her deadlines. If you are absent because you did not meet the deadline and rather give  the paper late and your a no show, she will make fun of you in class in your absence.\n"

She worked with me to try different ways of framing stories in order to make the telling easier.  \nShe really cares for her students and, while she is rather unorganized, it isn't much compared to the rest of the writing program faculty.\nWorkload:\nThree 7-10 page essays/stories; three 2-3 page exercises, intensely mandatory and timely attendance.\n"
