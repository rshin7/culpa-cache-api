Aside from the fact that you may or may not find the material in this class interesting, he does do a good job at summarizing the most important facts from lecture and adding to them. He really loves having you work in groups so you'll do that almost every class. Sometimes I did fall asleep, however that's not really his fault as he does a lot to keep you interested, including giving out large amounts of candy. He's always very approachable during his office hours and also during class which is definitely a plus.\nWorkload:\n1 quiz per week (very easy, only 1-2 questions), weekly light homework and reading assignments (1-2 hours), one easy midterm, one easy final (FoS standard workload)\n"
