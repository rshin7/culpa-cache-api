However at the beginning of the semester she told us not to take any notes, which did not work out well at the end of the semester when the final was far more detailed than she had prepared us for. And since the midterm was cut there was hardly anything to fall back on. Suddenly we had to memorize a huge list of names and dates that we'd been told all along were inconsequential. So don't listen to that advice. Take a few notes.\nWorkload:\nMinimal, one group presentation, a couple short papers. \n"
