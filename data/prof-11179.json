However, I recommend not taking Calc I over a summer six week course. It is way too much material in a very short amount of time. I struggled in the course but it was in no way Luis's fault. As with all COlumbia math courses, there was a generous curve (I got a B on the midterm with a 62). \nWorkload:\nFOR THE SUMMER 6 WEEK COURSE: 2 problem sets/week, 10-13 problems each 25%. A quiz every monday 15%. 1 midterm 30%, 1 final 30%.\n"
