When I read the reviews about Neeraja before the first day of Masterpieces of Indian Art and Architecture I was horrified and desperate to find another class to take.  My schedule did not allow this change, and I thought I was destined to suffer, seeing as the previous reviews are horrible.\n     I found Neeraja to be a great professor who loves the subject of Indian Art-this is her first time teaching this class.  A class about Indian art can be daunting if you know nothing about Indian heritage, culture, or religion.  However, Neeraja made this learning experience fun and exciting, choosing interesting articles to read and discuss.  She was very patient and helpful with these new terms, myths, etc.  We received handouts at almost each class to supplement what we read in the book and these were helpful.  Class participation is important to your grade.  Everyone will present on at least one article, which is mainly just leading a discussion on what you read, guided by Neeraja.  \n     The exams were not easy and did require a comprehensive knowledge of the subject matter.  There was never an easy A, but I also was not aware of anyone failing an exam or making below a C.  Her grading of our papers was less lenient, but the same principle from above applies.\n      I also wanted to briefly mention how approachable Neeraja is.  On many occasions I had to discuss personal issues with her after class and she was understanding and very willing to help.  If you have problems in the class--go to Neeraja's office hours or make an appointment!  Also, she is very helpful with paper feedback if you take questions to her before the due date.  \n     This class is not an easy A, but if you show up to class, do the reading and participate in class you will be fine.  This is a great choice of career for Neeraja.  I'm sorry the previous reviewers had such a bad time experience with her, maybe she wasn't an expert on the subject matter she taught prior to this class?  In this class she is an expert on the material, and if you're willing to put out the effort in this class, not only will you learn a lot, but you will enjoy it...I did!      \n\nWorkload:\nTwo papers, one around 3 pages, the second around 5.  Two exams:  a midterm and final.  Readings before each class from the book and articles, not too heavy although every now and then there will be a 30 page article.  \n"
