I'm glad I got Daniel Johnson as the instructor for my noble experiment, or I think it would have been an even more enormous pain in my butt than it already was. He's very nice and pretty laid-back, which helped, and he has an excellent dry sense of humor. My only real complaint would be his class management and organization: nitty-gritty stuff like what would be assigned when, what we would do in class each day, when the tests would be and what they would be on, etc. He would do stuff like forget what exercises we had done in the last class and, seeming not to hear the class's protests, go over the same exercises all over again. But if you don't mind a little flakiness, this class is definitely not a bad experience.\nWorkload:\nStandard elementary language stuff: compositions, quizzes, tests. He never seemed to collect our workbook exercises, even when he threatened to. The only crazy thing he threw at us was that the two presentations (one of which was a dialogue after we had only had about four chapters worth of grammar and vocab) were supposed to be ten minutes long, which is pretty insane when you only know one tense and maybe 100 vocabulary words. But it turned out OK, gradewise.\n"
