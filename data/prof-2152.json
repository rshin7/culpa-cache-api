            "review_content": "\nAfter a little over a semester with Ivan, I really like him as a CC teacher, and I'm sure that in his specialty (political science) he is even better.  He's very nice and very funny, and he clearly tries hard to do a good job.  He comes to class prepared and with plenty of topics.  I can only imagine how a PhD candidate in poli sci has enough time to so thoroughly research all of the readings we have to cover for CC, but somehow he has done a good job.  He is straightforward and cool, a nice change of pace from my very enigmatic, difficult, elderly lit him teacher from last year.  Ivan also has taken the time to plan a pizza party for the class with a movie, etc., and I know from experience that he is more than willing to discuss his experience as a grad student and in post-college life with any of his students.  A great guy all around.\nWorkload:\nTwo short papers per semester, graded fairly.  I've done well on my papers, but I've also put in more effort because I like Ivan and the class.  Midterm was essay based and he gave us the questions in advance.  Ditto for the final.  I did decently well (A- or so) after preparing decently hard, so I'd say he's fair.\n"
