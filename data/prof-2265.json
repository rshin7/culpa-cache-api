            "review_content": "\nI consider Laveen Naidu one of the best teachers at Columbia.  He gave all of his students tough love, and paid attention to everyone's weaknesses and improvements.  Most importantly, he really understands how to convey the ideas that he wants dancers to understand.  This comes as a refreshing contrast with the many dance teachers who struggle with explaining how to do things that they never found difficult.  Prof. Naidu started at Columbia this fall, and he might not return.  If he doesn't, we will all miss him!\nWorkload:\ntypical for a dance class\n"
