            "review_content": "\nWhat a relief to find a class where you actually learn practical skills beyond creating small talk at cocktail parties (thank you liberal arts)! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m grateful to have seen and tried writing business plans, learned about organization development, and received reality-based advice on management and trying to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do good\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for others while \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doing well\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for your company. However, classes failed to stay on topic in most cases, and while adjunct Prof. Kamber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s professional anecdotes were instructive and relevant, they tended to draw on too long and devoid students of sufficient discussion time. Readings fluctuated between very light to the occasional overload, and could be sufficiently accomplished through reading subtitles rather than line-by-line. The schedule of punctuated workloads is a relief in the light times and a burden at others when the 18-page paper deadline looms 3 days away and you still need to conduct two interviews and survey 30 people for market research. Overall, the refreshing practicality of the course overrode discussion and reading dissatisfactions, and the subject matter attracted an interesting array of concerned and engaged students.     \nWorkload:\nVariable weekly readings; 8p case study; 15-18p final paper worth 50% of grade\n"
