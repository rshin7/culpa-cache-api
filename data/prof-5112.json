            "review_content": "\nI took this class to fill SIPA's accounting credit. If I didn't need an accounting credit I probably wouldn't have taken it, but knowing that I'll probably end up in the nonprofit sector, I'm glad I could take it instead of accounting. \nI did pick up a decent amount of practical knowledge in the end. I learned to do a bunch of stuff in Excel and about the practical matter of creating a budget specifically for a nonprofit organization. Sarah seemed like a competent professional and she didn't like to waste time or energy on things that weren't necessary, so that was cool. She was helpful and accessible.  \nWorkload:\nVery light. Four easy lab assignments to make sure you can create and manage a budget in Excel.  Two group projects and one three-page written final exam.  There are weekly readings but she covers everything you need in lecture. \n"
