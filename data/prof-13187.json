This was an incredibly interesting course, and inspired me to attempt a concentration in HR which I would later drop.  I would highly recommend Professor Strauss.  She expects a lot from her students, including meeting with her or other students in the class for peer reviews regularly.  However, you will learn a lot and will never be bored in class. \nWorkload:\nsame as other UW courses\n"
