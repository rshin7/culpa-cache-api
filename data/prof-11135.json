He's super helpful, brings up ideas or facts that we didn't know otherwise, clarifies course material, and leads a very dynamic discussion (everyone gets really into discussion).  I don't know about his grading because I don't think he graded any of my work.  He's helpful and is willing to meet outside of time.  Plus, he's just super funny which makes class more entertaining.  He's very driven and dedicated to the subject matter.  Also, he walks you step by step through the answers to the midterm/final.  He's writing his thesis on \"people who touch radios to connect with God.\"  So yeah, he's pretty interesting.  He's got a lot of opinions and is great at playing devil's advocate in class.  \nWorkload:\nThe overall class has midterm + final, readings (not necessary except to study for tests), discussions are either in class or online (your choice), one film review\n"
