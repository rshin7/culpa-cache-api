Although it got off to a rocky start with very dry lecturing about gender  and sociology theory, it has turned into a mostly discussion based class on all aspects of gender. The lecture portion is almost always based on theory and applied in very approachable ways. Professor Braine is a very articulate lecturer, although her style can be a bit too academic and dry at times. Overall though, definitely worth taking.\nWorkload:\nManageable-- medium reading with a take home mid-term and final, and a 15 page research paper \n"
