He's surprisingly friendly and very personable, and delivers lectures incredibly clearly.\nWorkload:\n5-6 Homeworks, some relatively quick and some can take 6-7 hours. Go to office hours and you'll get significant help from the TAs. Two midterms and a final project that can vary wildly in the amount of work. No final.\n"
