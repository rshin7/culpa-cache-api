            "review_content": "\nKristen Roggemann is filled with a rather rich soul in a rather soul-less age. That said, she is by far, the WORST lecturer I have ever had. Though a nice piece of eye candy, Roggemann spent far too much time elaborating on recent turmoil in her private life (adventures with various outdoorsmen and a lack of 'Coach' reruns on TV). While interesting, her anecdotes about her trips to upper Minnesota to take part in family reunion-plays did little to expand my knowledge of the issues. However, when she is on task, the class is a gem. \nWorkload:\nThe reading selection is great, Beauvoir, Friedan, Meyerhoff, Fjeld... the list goes on. Two 7 page papers (that I swear are graded solely on font style) and a take home final (thats not all you'll want to take home).\n"
