I found him to be a terrific teacher, laid-back yet super-organized, and I learned more about mixing music from him in just a few weeks than I ever thought there was to know. Terry rocks too, so I'm not that sad about Graeme leaving, but I do hope Columbia continues to put his considerable teaching ability to good use.\nWorkload:\nAt your own pace.\n"
