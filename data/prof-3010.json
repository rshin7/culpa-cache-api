            "review_content": "\nBeginning with the ascribing agents of phallic identity, the assigner of semiotic modality and its collateral broadcast of power identity defined via counter oppositionary members is examined in depth within a post-modal perceptional dynamic hierarchy.  Here, phallic image is examined within the model context of gender identity and abjection subjugation of non-inclusive, exclusionary power non-membership, defined as being modally self-contained within the semiotic power assigner of a non-Cartesian deconstruction of self and the subsequent commodification of the polar-oppositionary ontologies from which the self emerges.  Of co-developed theoretic examination is the marginalization of a postpositivism meta-narrative of logocentrism within a multi-modal transference of a monologic catachresis of cultural phallic power dialectic.  The final analysis concluses with the cultural solubility of such multi-modal semiotics and the concept of \u00c2\u201crefractionary re-emergence,\u00c2\u201d in which the defining phallic modality reasserts itself following a fluidic semiotic discharge of a new lingua franca materialization.\nWorkload:\nWeekly readings from Para-masterbatory Post-Semiotics and The Phallas in Post-Feminist Thought: Friend or Foe?\n"
