The prof. is boring too. She asks students what they think about the readings, etc. She tries to make students to participate, but only a couple of them do it. She also asks students to do at least 2 short presentations during the semester, which is ok. \nOverall, Don't take this class unless you want to spend hours writing and reading for this class. This is not an easy A because she is a tough grader. \nWorkload:\nTons of readings, an essay every other week, 2 short presentations, 1 test, midterm, and final\n"
