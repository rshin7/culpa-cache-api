I have never seen such an enthusiastic prof at Columbia. The class material is very interesting and applicable to the daily life. It even covers relationships. She is a very successful prof overall. She is always very welcoming for questions, even not related to the subject directly. The exams are very straight-forward and mostly expecting you to explain the theory thoroughly and provide examples. \nDEFINITELY RECOMMENDED\nWorkload:\n2 midterms (easy) 1 final (medium) 8 extremely easy, mostly commenting or giving examples to the concepts pop-up quizzes (15%) Very light workload\n"
