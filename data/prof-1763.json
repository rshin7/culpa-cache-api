Keep in mind that I do love reading and English, so maybe the review will be biased, but Prof. Murray makes the facilitated conversations about the class incredibly interesting. \nShe's a very understanding professor\u2014I did take this class during online covid times, and I know she adjusted the workload accordingly because of how stressful the world was. My understanding is that during a normal year there would be more essays and assignments, but I don't get the impression that it would be undoable. \nEssentially, she just is very supportive of the class thinking about the text, she wants us to share, she wants us to listen to one another. It's a great, great class. Even though we were taking the class on zoom, pretty much everyone had their videos every day. I think most of us were happy to participate!\nWorkload:\nThe reading is kind of heavy, but it's not undoable nor worse really than other LitHum classes. Also had two discussion posts a week and a reading journal.\n"

Prof. Murray is super engaging and loves her students to have discussions. Her class was always so fun and I always looked forward to it. I learned so much from Prof Murray but also from my classmates. She doesn't lecture, she really wants everyone to contribute - so if you want to sit in the corner and be quiet then you won't do well in this class. You have to be willing to speak up about your ideas but she fosters such an engaging environment that you will soon feel very comfortable talking. We also did weekly 'vibe checks.' Overall Prof Murray is great, tells stories about her son, brings snacks for us. \nWorkload:\ndiscussion post based on reading each class\n2-3 papers/semester\nno midterm\nfinal\n"

            "review_content": "\nIf you have Professor Murray, you've been blessed by the SSOL gods. Don't switch out! I'm currently a sophomore. I was in her LitHum class last year, and just a few days ago I saw her walking and we talked. Soon after, I had a sudden epiphany to write this review. Yes, she's that good. Just being reminded of her would make you want to shower her \"professoral abilities\", as she likes to say, with rainbows of praise. \nYou will probably not be bored during class. She's incredibly smooth with discussions, bringing up interesting topics or controversial questions regarding the text. She often allows students to reply to each other before moving on. While some professors try to engage as many people in a single conversation, Professor Murray allows two students to debate on a topic in a back-and-forth manner. This means that the conversations are very natural and seem to be more like a true discussion instead of just class participation points. Listening to these energetic conversations are also quite fun and engaging. She also helps build upon student ideas. Oftentimes, it's hard to get my idea across, but Professor Murray always reformulates it in a more cohesive way before throwing it back to the class. It's really helpful! It keeps the discussion clear and smooth.\nThough the LitHum course itself seems to be quite stressful for some people, Professor Murray makes it as stress-free as possible.  She's super flexible with deadlines and stuff. I know classmates who have had their essays pushed back two weeks at no additional costs. She's super understanding and really considers her students' workload. Just talk to her and she'll understand that you have either six hour rehearsals, three tests, another essay, a midterm, or whatnot. \nI like her sense of humour, she occasionally brings thematic foods such as gummy snakes for the Oresteia (spoilers?), or spicy candies for Dante's Inferno. Her energy in class is contagious. You get the sense that she's a real person and not just a professor teaching LitHum because sometimes she rants about politics and the depressing state of the world and then tells you to be a better person despite it all. She sometimes go on wild tangents but we always get stuff done in the end. All in all, she's an amazing teacher. Couldn't ask for more. \nWorkload:\nLitHum reading. 2-3 essays per semester. 2 discussion posts of courseworks each week. 1 final. \nHonestly, if you just do all the reading, which you should because her class is super fun and even better if you actually understand what's going on, you'll do just fine. \n"

            "review_content": "\nNote: She's usually on SSOL as Mary Pollard Murray, which confused me when I first searched for her on CULPA.\nI had Molly Murray for Lit Hum two years ago, and she went on sabbatical afterwards. My advice: if you're lucky enough to wind up in her class, DO NOT switch out. We were the only section in that year to not have a single student drop; in a mandatory class with students of all interests, everyone tailored their schedules to make sure they could stay with her. That should speak for itself, but I'll keep going anyway.\nShe tends to get lost in tangents with the class, but it's a 2-hour course and we always got through the material just fine. So if that's somehow a drawback, it's a small one to consider. I wouldn't say she's a tough grader, but her feedback is honest and your grade will reflect it. But she's rooting for you.\nOtherwise, I think she ruined me for most future professors. She witty, cool, collected, speaks most languages that you'll encounter on the syllabus (and brings the original texts in those languages to reference as needed). She's extremely knowledgable but not in a way that keeps you from engaging. If you have an inkling of an idea, you can throw it out there and you'll probably get a \"say more!\" as she helps you build upon that idea.\nWhat's more, it's really touching to have a teacher that can take an interest in her students like she does. Especially if you have her for Lit Hum and she's a big part of your freshman experience. \nI also agree with a past review about her dress. It's hardly the most impressive thing about her, but it's a little heartbreaking that she dresses so well on top of everything else.\nWorkload:\nTypical Lit Hum. First semester saw 3 3-5p papers. Second semester she changed it up so that you could do the same, or write 2 6-8p papers (if memory serves). She's accommodating. Definitely stop by her office hours; she's happy to help you form or expand on a topic.\n"

The class also had a wealth of graduate students, which added a sense of depth to the course, and added to the air of specialization in the room. Prof. Murray was able to make the material relevant to those without a basic knowledge of the period, for which she should be commended.\nWorkload:\nTwo papers, one of which was more of a project and entailed contextual research that was, admittedly, more familiar to graduate students, but took into account students' experience with such projects; a midterm that included an essay and passage identification; a final that the class voted (by narrow margin!) to be take-home.\n"

She is quickly responsive to emails, and very reasonable about her workload.\nAfter effusively offering extensions for the first paper and sixty members of the class took her up on it, she refused to tie extensions for the second paper. Not sure of our class disillusioned her from offering ever again, but it might be worth being cautious with that offer in the future.\nWorkload:\nReasonable; two papers, toward the latter half of the semester, one final exam in the form of a paper, and one very brief identification midterm.

            "review_content": "\nIf you are a poetry or lit person this class is probably for you. If you are neither of these things, DO NOT take this class. The only part of this class that makes it an \"Intro\" is that it is a survey of 1000 years of poetry. Besides that, it is completely taught for lit majors and 'poetry people.' The professors are both lively and brilliant (especially Golston), but at the end of the day the class is an unbelievable drag. Murray's lectures are rushed and scattered, and she can be quite condescending if you visit her office hours. Golston is much better, but the lectures lack big picture ideas and spend too much time on historical background and abstract concepts. Too much time is spent reading into things that aren't in the text. Overall, very disappointing and a huge pain in the ass as a non-lit person.\nWorkload:\nA 5 page technical paper in which you analyze a poem's structure and how that plays into its content (not easy). A 6-8 page paper in which you choose one technical term (i.e. rhyme, meter, enjambment, etc.) and discuss it in relation to 3 poets. (Also not fun).\nThe final was without a doubt the worst aspect of this class. One of the reasons I was willing to take this lit course was knowing that the exam (as stated on the syllabus presented on the first day of class) had a take-home final. However, it was only AFTER the add/drop deadline that Golston nonchalantly informed us that \"it was not possible\" to have a take-home, but that we would rather have an in-class 3 hour exam.\nThe exam requires literally knowing everything. You must be able to recognize passages of poems and poetical papers, scan a difficult sonnet, and write an essay (which is open-handout) in which you are required to quote from different poets, etc. For the ID section, I'd advise focusing ONLY on the major works discussed in class, as those are what primarily show up on the test.\n"

Prof. Murray is truly inspirational (and well dressed) and was always willing to recommend extra books and articles. My bookcase is now filled with books that she and Prof. Golston recommended. \nBesides their amazing lectures, though, Profs. Murray and Golston were also very available and friendly. They never hesitated to stay and chat about poetry after class and were very encouraging when I asked paper questions. \nAs for the course, for anyone interested in poetry, what could be better? The readings were all amazing, and Profs. Murray and Golston interspersed them with insightful analysis and interesting anecdotes. Even though I had read many of the poets before, I learned a great deal from this class and really enjoyed tracing the progression of English poetic theory. \nWe also had a guest lecture on hip-hop by Kalefa Sanneh and two poets read for the last class--both really wonderful things.\nWorkload:\nThe assignments all seemed very reasonable, and I really enjoyed writing the final paper.

Of course, the quality of a lecture is inversely proportionate to your requirement to be there, so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much choice.  Her energy and enthusiasm are genuine enough but quickly fizzle into inarticulate apologies for her own, well, inarticulateness (Is this making sense?  Do you guys get it?  Am I doing OK?)

Yeah, she's that good.\nHow good, you ask?\nLitHum walks a fine line between a very small lecture class, in which the professor talks at the students for two hours and the students never talk back, and a free-for-all seminar where students share their oddball interpretations and personal feelings about the text without any real academic grounding. While we tended to list a little in the direction of lecture, our section frequently achieved that perfect balance where Prof. Murray gave us plenty of enough of her own (brilliant) interpretation and analysis without talking too much, and we spent most of the class speaking intelligently amongst ourselves. She wasn't afraid to let people know when she disagreed with them, but she actively encouraged that kind of dissent, and it made for vastly better discussions.\nShe came into most classes with thematically-appropriate snacks (think \"Little Schoolboy\" cookies for a discussion of the Symposium), and blew her entire discretionary budget on full meals at our end-of-semester review sessions.\nShe also speaks Greek, Latin and French, which gets you most of the way through the LitHum syllabus, and she comes into class with source-languages texts to resolve any difficulties with translation.\nShe is a tough (but fair) essay grader, happily crossing out sentences (and sometimes even parts of paragraphs) that she thinks are not well-defended or just don't belong in the paper, and she absolutely drenches every page in green ink with suggestions for strengthening and refinement. Every essay is additionally returned with a detailed letter explaining, in longhand, her broader thoughts about structure and content. My writing improved much more as a result of this class than it did of UW. You will strive mightily for your A paper, but when you get it, it will feel so, so sweet.\nBut what makes this class, more than anything else, is her unbelievable passion for the material -- it's impossible not to pick up at least some of her overflowing enthusiasm. She is, like a certain refrigerator that appears late in the syllabus (with apologies to Woolf), endowed with heavenly bliss. She is fringed with joy. It rubs off.\nCongratulations -- you have a good year ahead of you.\nWorkload:\nStandard Lit Hum; lots of reading, but worth the effort.\n3 4-6 page papers each semester, second semester the third paper was optional.\n"

She is also a character and class time is never boring! She is great! I would recomend any class by her.\nWorkload:\nNot too bad. 3 papers and normal lit hum reading. She is a fair grader. \n"

Not only is she incredibly erudite and brilliant, she is also passionate about her subject matter and about her students. And she's just really friendly and fun to talk to as well. Yes, it's her first year as a full-time teacher and she can be a bit scatterbrained at times, but you will not find another professor at this school who cares as much about teaching you weird non-canonical 16th and 17th century texts as she does. Take any class she teaches, even if you don't think you'll like the subject matter; by the end you will. And be very, very thankful if you get her for Lit Hum, I'm sure she's fantastic.\nWorkload:\nnormal for a seminar: lots of reading, a nonstressful class presentation, a short paper and a long paper\n"

When I first walked into her class, I was a little anxious considering the fact that it was her first semester teaching Lit Hum, but this woman is honestly fabulous.  She somehow manages to keep the class rigorous and thoughtful in content, but also fun and easy going in affect, as all Lit Hum classes should be.  Professor Murray can simulatenously offer accurate ancient Greek translations of the Iliad while muttering how her copy of Herodotus flew off a motorcycle on her way to see Ray Liota at a restaurant being fondled by a group of trashy women.  She's all you could ever ask for in a college professor -- both pedagogical (her favorite word) and sensitive to suggestion -- and you are mighty lucky if you end up in one of her classes.  In conclusion, she's the shit, so enjoy her!\n"

Her lectures are thoroughly enjoyable: beautifully worded, and delivered breathlessly (which shows that she is doing her darndest to teach us everything she knows in the alloted time).

She's very down-to-earth and approachable, and really interested in helping students.  I recommend taking a class with her, especially if you're an english major.  It's a great way to satisfy one of the pre-1800 requirements. \n\nWorkload:\none 3-5 page paper analyzing a single sonnet, one 7 page paper analyzing mutliple poems, an in-class midterm which was really easy, and a take-home final.  \n"
