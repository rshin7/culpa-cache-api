At first I found him uninspiring and lazy, but after a few weeks into the course, I found this a wonderful 'anything goes' theme that allowed me to experiment with the assignment as I needed or wanted and through this I found my own style, which was one of the goals of the class.\nWorkload:\nproject in class which you either finish or take home to complete. Usually a weekend project that was a peacefull 1-3 hours of \"work\". Critic at the end of each class, and a final project- left to your discretion.\n"
