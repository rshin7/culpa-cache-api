            "review_content": "\nA really outstanding teacher -- Olivia is a graduate student, which gives her greater insight into what her students will enjoy or respond to, but in terms of confidence in front of a classroom, she seems extremely comfortable. She leads classroom discussion well, but more than that, she is an excellent editor and cuts right to the essential weaknesses of your writing. While she expects a lot, especially as the semester progresses, she is always extremely helpful in going over papers. Olivia addressed issues in my writing that no other previous English teacher had, AP or otherwise. In terms of the workload, the papers can get a bit overwhelming, but it's more a function of the class than the teacher. Overall, a little tough as a grader, but very fair. If you get Olivia, be thankful. \nWorkload:\nWeekly readings that are engaging and not long; four papers, the first two being 5-6 pages, the third being 10, and the fourth one only 3 pages. Requires effort, but good time management makes it much easier. \n"
