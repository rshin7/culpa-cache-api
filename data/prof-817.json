            "review_content": "\nI have to say, I think Greet is borderline genius (and check your egos at the door because this class will most likely be quite the humbling experience) but the rest of us (specifically myself included) are not. I\u00c2\u2019m a literature/\nwriting major, no talent for foreign languages, possibly the same handicap another reviewer mentioned, but nonetheless with an enormous admiration and jealousy for those who do have it. My French tutor, also Belgian, picks up language fluency like colds, in fact I had no idea she was not a native Parisian speaker until she made a comment about translating from French to Dutch to English. \nEither way, I sincerely had a chuckle, in identification with some frustrated reviews and a completely lost, FOREIGN alienation from others. I once did a radio show with a DJ friend and he said that the only people who call or write in are those that either love you or hate you. With that subjectivity in mind and the nature of these reviews, I never really planned on writing this\u00c2\u2014spell check please\u00c2\u2014\nthis is supposed to be Ivy. \nAnyhow, that said, she has that inexplicable quality (in spades) that makes or breaks a professor, i.e. an ability that cannot be taught, to reveal and instruct, in an epiphany way. She is entertaining, charming and really quite stellar\u00c2\u2026.but will that win you a grade on an exam\u00c2\u2026\nnot so much. If you are more advanced than you claim to be, which I suspect some GPA-saving fellow students are, then this is the class for you. Otherwise buyer beware\u00c2\u2026\nI am an unsuspecting and na\u00c3\u00afve student, that schedules a course because of strict and stringent time constraints on my part. I study my ass of specifically because I am not naturally gifted in this area and plan on imminent graduate studies, or in other words and in all honesty, because I have to. But more times than not I experience that \u00c2\u2018deer in the headlights\u00c2\u2019 moment, feeling completely vulnerable and lost. Which is in fact part and parcel of the entire experience of learning a foreign language or travelling in a foreign country.\nYet, for all my enjoyment, and for remarkably the most gratifying and exceeding amount I have ever actually learned and walked away with from a language course, I feel there is a major disconnect between what I have learned and what I am being evaluated on. Even the collecting of workbooks, a minor twice-a-semester-\ninquiry, that inputs information of effort into the grey area of the grading process would be a fair and justifiable point of reference. I am well aware that this is Intermediate French and that comes with many assumptions, some soft-skills accompanying the hard-\nskills of language learning would be the icing on the cake. \nLest I ramble\u00c2\u2026If I had to do it all over again, I would take any of her courses (ideally a literature course because her talent and artistry lie there) but with more forewarning. Be prepared to kill yourself with (sometimes un-rewarded effort) assignments compared to any of your other course load\u00c2\u2026but as they say, \u00c2\u2018no pain, no gain.\u00c2\u2019 Will my GPA (that sacred ground) suffer, probably, but am I getting my money\u00c2\u2019s worth, hell yeah. She packs a punch, every class (regretfully including those missed) is a bang for your buck. She is the antithesis of the professor that goes through the motions. \nWorkload:\nLet's not mince words THE HEAVIEST OF THE HEAVY\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class was very stressful for me as I do not intend on pursuing French any further than I have to in order to fulfill the language requirement. I mean, seriously, my major is psychology. She is very thoroughand a good professor , but a bit much if you do not intend on continuing French or if you are not serious about it. There is a LOT of work: 3 composititions, 3 quizzes (with plenty of vocab you won't know), and a midterm adn final. She also assigns homework every night, and assigns little assignments that she thinks will be \"fun\" for us that se randomly thinks of in class. This class got annoying for me pretty quickly. But if you really want to learn the language and aren't just trying to fulfill the language requirement, than it is a good and thorough class, and I have to say, I did learn quite a bit.\nWorkload:\nsee above\n"

She is engaging and funny and her strange methods really do work if you have an open mind. While I think it involved a little more work than the other sections, it was all useful. \nWe read interesting texts and had a fun writing assignment at the end of the semester. \nOverall, I found it a very stimulating and rewarding class.\nWorkload:\napprox 15 mins of exercises/questions per class; 3 1-2 pg papers (2 drafts); 3 quizzes; mid-term and final \n"

This is the second part of Elementary French and, naturally, most of us are far from being fluent.  However, the amount of French that we have learned in this intensive summer course is tantamount to what one would learn in a whole year.  Greet is as enthusiastic a professor as I have ever met and during the two hours/day  four days a week that we meet, she keeps the group involved and constantly talking and discussing the nuances of the language.  I would absolutely recommend Greet van Belle if you really, really want to learn French.\nWorkload:\nThe workload is heavy.  There is the daily reading from the textbook and the assignments in the written and oral workbooks, but if it were not so, we would probably not learn anything by the end of the semester.

If however, you have trouble learning languages, have any learning disabilities, or are just plain human then this is NOT the professor to be taking for french.\nI could barely maintain my sanity with this teacher. Her expectations were unrealistic and unwarrented. She acted as though the class ought to have been light years ahead of its time. She would give us homework assignments and expect that we should know the material inside and out by the next day.  Forget the fact that one might have three, four, or five other classes--she did not care and assigned bizarre amounts of homework and then barely explained any of it in class.\nShe was late everyday to not to mention that she did not post the homework until after 5:00p.m. and sometimes not until past 7:00p.m. It was even worse on weekends---class ended on a Thursday and homework would not be posted until Saturday and at times Sunday. It was crazy!\nShe was not the most approachable teacher and she often became frustrated with people in the class if they did not know what she was talking about, half the time we did know what she was talking about.\nI could not take it anymore. Finally, I had to imagine I had been abducted by aliens who, sans the anal probe, were forcing me to learn french and would release me some time in December.\nThat is how I got through this class with this teacher.\n\nWorkload:\nconfusing, ridiculous---without a lot of outside help I would have drowned because of her lack of explainations\n"

It must be difficult to teach the same class twice a day, each lasting 2 hours, but she came to the second class with great enthusiasm (often more than the students) and was always fair and encouraging.

She has a way of bringing texts to life by reading aloud and assigning different affected voices to each character. Her renditions of the literature were often hilarious, even though she was sometimes hesitant to listen to students' ideas.

And while the workload is definitely above average, she is a very fair and lenient grader, and will not take off points for grammar/spelling mistakes.

First of all she came to the first lecture thinking she was teaching Major Lit BEFORE 1800, so she basically didn't have anything prepared for this semester. She expected us to go almost weekly to the French department to pick up photocopied material, which was never there because something somehow always went wrong -- and then she'd be mad about it the next lecture because none of us could do the reading. Most of the time she was late to class. She assumed that the students knew more about French literature than they actually did so sometimes her so called lectures didn't make sense, and when asked to give a general overview of the genre of literature, she'd just sigh and said, oh that's very difficult, and end up going on a tangent, not answering the question. Worst of all, her assignments are unreasonable and ill-timed. Instead of a midterm, we had to write TWO 5-10pg papers (originally it was at least 15pgs each but we protested). The oral presentations were a disaster. The final was a take-home, and she said she would have topics in her mailbox and send it out on email. It was supposed to have been 2 essays as well, but when we got the topics on email, she had changed her mind and made it 3 essays, claiming she still thought it was a very lenient final. \nWorkload:\n2 LONG papers, oral presentation, take-home final of 3 essays.\n"
