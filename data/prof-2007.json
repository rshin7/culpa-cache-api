            "review_content": "\nI took the Medieval Latin survey (V3033) and a more advanced course on Biblical Exegesis (W4152--topic changes every year). Without a doubt, Professor Franklin is one of the best professors I had at Columbia and particularly within the Classics Department. Particularly in the survey--and unlike many professors in the Department who end up emphasizing one over the other--Professor Franklin maintains a proper balance between time spent on reading Latin and practicing language skills and delving interpretatively into the text or its historical context.\nProfessor Franklin is always friendly and intersperses her classes with hilarious and incredibly interesting anecdotes about her illustrious career as a scholar of Medieval Latin. She has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of centuries of Latin literature and theology, and particularly of the Church Fathers. She is, moreover, always willing to talk during her office hours--always helpful, friendly, and incredibly interesting. Also, her outfits are amazing.\nIn short, take her classes!\nWorkload:\n3033: Midterm: one poetry and one prose translations from known texts, one essay or sight translation, some very simple term IDs. Final: same as the midterm with an added commentary on one of the translated passages. One paper 6-8 pages. Weekly readings/translations which vary in length, but about 100 lines per week on average. All fairly graded.\n4152: Midterm and final same as above. One paper 10-12 pages (12-15 for grad students). Slightly longer translations than for 3033.\n"
