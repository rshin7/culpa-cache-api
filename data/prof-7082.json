She's highly knowledgeable and loves the material, breaks up her lecture with real-life examples (and plenty of stories about her kids), and genuinely cares about her students and wants them to succeed. Reading is helpful to supplement lectures and to prepare for a few test questions, but the majority of test questions come from lectures and the eight problem sets. Problem sets are time consuming, but Professor Lofgren gives full credit for effort as long as you get most of it right. Overall, it's an enlightening experience with an expert economist with a sense of humor. \nWorkload:\nEight time consuming problem sets graded for effort and some command of the material, two fair midterms of average difficulty and one final that's a little bit easier. \n"
