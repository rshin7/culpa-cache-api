Case studies were interesting and informative, there were no surprises. She took Econometrics a long time ago with Phoebus Dhrymes (Econometrics) and thus understands the shortcomings of the econ dept at Columbia, so she tries to make things better. That sweet motherly voice of hers is an added bonus.\nWorkload:\nCase studies that are long, but fun, you can work in groups for almost anything.\n"
