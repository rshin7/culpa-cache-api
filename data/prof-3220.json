            "review_content": "\nProfessor Farinato is very organized and informational.  He comes to each lecture with a  pdf file of the presentation that you can download to follow along with.  The homeworks really help to further understand the material, and his lectures are very clear and organized.  He is also very approachable.  He is not a full-time professor but rather has a job in industry, so he also manages to bring a different perspective to the classroom.  You will become familiar with reading patents in industry.  I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the topic!\nWorkload:\nmedium-high for an elective class.  The problem sets varied in difficulty.  No midterm or final, just homeworks, class participation, and a term project on a topic of your choosing, which he encourages you to make useful to you by relating to your graduate studies.  Some readings.\n"
