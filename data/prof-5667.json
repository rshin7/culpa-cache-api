            "review_content": "\nGeoff was nice, low-key, and relatively lenient. He doesn't presume that we have musical knowledge like some other music hum profs. Not a particularly exciting class but he tries to make it sorta interesting. Very little reading and listening homework (and what little reading is assigned is not even necessary). Gives practice midterm/final questions and tells us exactly what is/is not covered; doesn't try to trick us on exams, which are in the fair/easy difficulty range. Very forgiving with grading of concert reports. I'm not a music person at all and am partially tone-deaf (seriously) but still wound up with an A. Not a fascinating experience, but low stress and painless.\nWorkload:\nVery low. Two concert reports, occasional reading.\n"
