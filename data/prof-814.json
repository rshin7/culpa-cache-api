            "review_content": "\nDon't be fooled by John Titus's hippy like appearance. He is a brilliant man, devoted teacher, and excellent lecturer. I started out the semester frustrated and even skeptical of him and with all the \"grey areas\" of conservation biology. He encouraged me to question, allowing me to reach explorer for myself the ideas that bothered me. By the end of the semester, he had taught me so much by by simply being there, with honest and enlightening comments to my many questions. To top it all off, he rewards creativity and notices those students who put the extra effort in thier work. An invaluable member of the Columbia faculty.\nWorkload:\nPerfectly reasonable. Study his lectures for exams.\n"
