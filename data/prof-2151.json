            "review_content": "\nThis course is fairly difficult and Professor Loh does nothing to make it easier.  While it is not his fault that the lectures are boring (how could a stats lecture not be?), he is not a particularly good lecturer.  His midterm is doable, as is the final.  The weekly problem sets, however, were extremely time-consuming and long.  What makes matters worse is that Loh's textbook is quite possibly, the least helpful textbook ever written.  If you take this course, I doubt you will get lower than a B.  However, I also doubt you will get much higher.  Overall, I disliked this class and found Professor Loh to be a poor (albeit competent) professor.\nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets which are long and hard, midterm and final (both challenging but doable, the cheat sheet is essential).  He also threatens pop quizzes but we only had one.\n"
