            "review_content": "\nIncredibly approachable, capable, and friendly professor. Casiana creates youtube videos that include popular French songs/ reference French culture, hands out helpful worksheets, and keeps students updated on movies being shown at the Maison Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise. She is always eager to assist those who are struggling, and encourages a great deal of partner work which facilitates French conversation. Excellent professor for the beginner who is timid or nervous about their French speaking skills. I think she recently graduated from college, and can thus relate to students. She's a genuinely kind professor and her class offers a refreshingly painless means of completing core requirements.  \nWorkload:\nStandard for a language class. Put in the work, you'll get the A. Nothing too demanding\n"
