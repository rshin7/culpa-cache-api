Given the stupidity of the website-based pedagogy, janette allows a great deal of freedom for estudiantes while still al fin y a cabo, makes class time a breeze/studying minimal\nRead! \nActually, don't. She explains everything in the last 2 minutes of class.\nLiterally.\nBut legit. I'm a major in whatever this department s called, and a -- gringo -- and give her the gold. La calle sabe..\nWorkload:\n\u00c2\u00bf?...yeah. Composici\u00c3\u00b3n al infinito...\nMas la culpa no es suya.\n3 exams, but general not too nitty gritty.\n"

            "review_content": "\nJannette is AMAZING! She is young and knows her stuff - she may come off shy and timid, but she really just wants the class to participate. Work with her and she will work with you - I highly recommend office hours, and emails - she will answer all your questions. She is also very knowledgeable on how to help you with general information - how to write your paper, departmental connections, recommends other courses to take etc. \nThe course itself has some very interesting readings - good novels, but others a little boring, and so it is the class discussions that make the work. The ideas build on each other. You don't have to know anything about Hispanic history or politics - however, familiarizing yourself with basic politics and Latin America helps. \nHighly recommend this course - great way to get your Global Core done, enjoyable too. However - do the readings, you don't want to fall behind, and for your own good, it helps and is interesting. \nWorkload:\nThere are reading for every class - some heavier than others (like a print out online or a novel) - and although reading the entirety of the assignment is not necessary, maybe some skimming, familiarity with the material is necessary. The concepts build on each other. \n2 papers; a midterm; and a final. \n\"Class participation\" - discussion board on Courseworks, attendance, commenting in class *Really easy way to get credit! and the class discussions get really interesting. \n"

            "review_content": "\nShe's cool, young, and hip and brings an energy to the class that is very comforting. She teaches the class mostly in Spanish which is cool.  She's extremely pleasant and likeable and goes out of her way to accommodate students' needs.  If you got her either by choice or default, consider yourself lucky.\nWorkload:\nLots of sheets and handouts, some reading and homework every night, a small quiz per week, one oral presentation, two short essays (one on a movie,) midterm and final.  I took this class during the summer so it was a bit intense and condensed but definitely manageable!!!  Good luck!\n"

            "review_content": "\nMs. Amaral is an excellent Spanish instructor for those who want a structured learning environment. She is extremely competent and always well-prepared. For those anal people like myself who have studied other languages, her knowledge of the finer points of grammar is very helpful. She speaks mostly Spanish in class, but will explain more difficult things in English when necessary. She keeps things interesting without resorting to a lot of silly, juvenile games that waste everybody\u00c2\u2019s time. If you have the maturity of a high school student, don\u00c2\u2019t take her class. I took Spanish not just because of the language requirement, but because I actually wanted to learn. Thanks to her class, I have learned a lot and feel confident about the next semester of Spanish. She grades very fairly, and takes off small increments of points, but doesn't hand everything to you on a silver platter. If you want to do really well and learn, you'll have to do the required work (see below).\nWorkload:\nbasic 1101 workload: tons of quizzes, three short compositions, midterm, final, oral. There's no way of avoiding it because it's the same for all classes, unless you have a really subpar instructor. It sounds like a lot, but it's not a big burden that will interfere with your work for other classes. Unless you're a lazy moron, it's still an easy A.\n"
