            "review_content": "\n    The review below is an perfect example of a resentful student who is unsatisfied with his/her grade and blames it all on the professor.\n    The first essay was graded relatively harshly, however, if you did well on the second and the third, you would still get an A range grade even if you got a C plus for your first essay. Professor Kitcher and the TAs are all very patient and encouraging. They want you to do well - given that you make an effort - and take something out of this rather large lecture.\n    This was my first philosophy class and I was very grateful of how much I learned about religion and the sophistication of its debate with science. The course is certainly not a belief-changing experience (and shouldn't be), but it definitely helps you appreciate both sides of the debate more and reexamine your own position. \n    Professor Kitcher is a fantastic lecturer: you will also find out that he has the potential of becoming a great actor after listening to his reading of The Brothers Karamazov. In general this is a great and unique into to philosophy. Instead of \"avoid[ing]\" it, one should seek it out if one can.\n    Before I end this review I would like to point out two fallacies in the previous review:\n      1) Professor Kitcher certainly did not say \"humanity is developing on the right track, and we are becoming more 'moral' and \"ethical' as history goes by.\" Ironically, this was the view he was trying to attack. Professor Kitcher's view on progress is very similar to that of Kuhn, which (generally speaking) states that progress doesn't mean leading *to* the truth but making something new *from* what is already there. It is in that sense that we are becoming more \"moral\" and \"ethical\". (I cannot guarantee that my wording is accurate, but the generally idea is not false.) Even if this were a \"dangerous thing to say to young students\", the students wouldn't have to accept that.\n      2) There is difference between a \"philosophy essay\" and a piece of \"philosophical writing\", which the previous review failed to identify. I don't want to waste time making the distinction...if you think they are the same...maybe that explains why you think the grading is harsh in the first place.\nWorkload:\nLight reading\n3 essays: two 3-5 pages; one 8-10 pages.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis class was one of the best academic experiences I've had.  Kitcher is a fantastic lecturer; very clear, well organized, and detail oriented.  He structured the class in an accessible way, starting off with the \"easier\" books and working into Ulysses, which took up the majority of the semester.  We went one chapter per class through U., which is the only way to really study the book in detail, with all its intricacies and nuance.  It's a lot of tough reading, but very rewarding, and I can't imagine that there is a better professor out there with whom to study this material.  \nKitcher has read all of these books many times (as he admitted in class, and as is evident as well from his depth of knowledge), which is quite an asset in a professor for a first-time reader of Joyce.  This literature is unique in that it takes a lot of guidance to even get the basic techniques and premises, not to mention the subtleties and upper-structural elements, and Kitcher did a great job of not losing sight of this fact.  He always kept his lectures grounded in the foundations of the three books while also hitting upon more subjective or elusive material.  I found that as I became comfortable with the former, the latter started to become more and more interesting and rewarding to study. \nTake this class if at all possible.  It's worth it even for non-lit majors.  \nWorkload:\na lot of difficult reading although it is diffused through out the semester. you read Dubliners, Portrait, and Ulysses. No Finnegan's Wake which I was quite happy about come the end of the semester (U. is exhausting). Two short 3-4 pagers responding to passages and a final paper of 2000-2500 words. \n"

But let me add a couple things to keep in mind when taking a seminar class with Professor Kitcher, especially Lit Hum:\n(1) If, like me, you are unbearably shy, and the thought of taking a seminar in which \"participation\" is part of your grade is among your worst fears, then Philip Kitcher is your man. He is exceedingly understanding in this department, and will gladly allow you to submit written responses to readings before class if you ask his permission at the beginning of the semester. Best of all, though, Professor K is so thoughtful and receptive a discussion leader that, by the end of the semester, he'll be able to draw out even the quietest students in class.\n(2) If you aren't willing to scrutinize every sentence you put into an essay and ask yourself, \"What exactly am I saying here?\" then Philip Kitcher is most certainly not your man. He is brutal\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI mean this in the best way\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhen it comes to picking apart every aspect of your argument, which means that you will learn more about writing from his red ink and meeting with him during office hours than you'll ever learn in UWriting (which may not be saying much, but you get the point). Don't expect to get away with clever turns of phrase and self-important words that add nothing to what you're trying to say; this may sound like an obvious lesson, but Professor Kitcher will assure you that it really isn't.\nIn short, give him no bullshit and Philip Kitcher will give you unconditional love. What more could you ask for?\nWorkload:\nProfessor Kitcher deviated from the Lit Hum syllabus only by having us read the entirety of The Inferno (why is this not required for all of Lit Hum?), and adding Paradise Lost and Christa Wolf's Cassandra; the latter was a good thematic choice in the questions it raises on The Iliad and The Oresteia, but kind of a downer to be talking about on the last couple days of class. Also, two essays, a midterm with only seven identifications and one essay, and the final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nPhilip Kitcher is a remarkably thought provoking professor who is also totally approachable and dedicated to making one's undergraduate experience really rewarding.  Kitcher's lectures were really put together, but he engaged actively in discussion whenever anyone had a question or wanted to accuse him of either being too religious or not religious enough. Kitcher did a really great job of outlining exactly where the course was headed and made sure to cover all the facets of religion: from Focus on the Family to Balinese Water Temples.  Personally, I found the course to be really enlightening on all the different ways one can think about religion and how that conception works with or against science.  I would, however, caution those who are ardent Dawkinsian Atheists or Bible Thumping Christians from signing up for this course with the hope that you will be able to wage war against the other side and get Kitcher to endorse you.  That is, simply put, not what Kitcher wants you to get out of the course. The class is geared for those looking to get a bigger perspective on the nature of both science and religion not for those whom have already chosen a side.  Kitcher wants you to think about the issue not just defend a position well.  That said there were a great number of ardent Atheists and Catholics in the class and their dialogue was very interesting throughout the course so don't think this course is just for the weak minded who can't make a decision either!\nSo, Kitcher as a professor is excellent and his combination of lecture and discussion is thrilling, but a third thing Kitcher get right is the workload. There are only 3 essays for this class and no tests. This means that you don't have to do the reading if you are swapped, but don't expect to understand much of the class if you skip too many.  The idea is the Kitcher wants us wrestling wit the ideas in the course and not memorizing arguments or who said what in what chapter of what book.  The light work load encouraged me to think more about the content of the class than if I had been studying for a midterm and final.  Take this class, keep an open mind, and sit back and let Kitcher work his magic and enhance your understand of the question of science and religion!\nWorkload:\nWonderfully light. Two 5 page papers on topics handed out in class, and both worth ~25% of your grade. A final 10 page paper worth 50% and on a topic of your choice.\n"

            "review_content": "\nBearded, gaunt, coming to class each day with hunched back and hat in hand and addressing his congregation in the limpid tones of Received Pronunciation, Philip Kitcher is the walking embodiment of Britannitas.  His was a particularly British geekdom - at one point, he claimed to have first read Finnegans Wake when he was in his early teens - and he has fulfilled this kind of depressing promise to become a premiere philosopher of science, a prominent atheist, a Columbia philosophy professor, and now the lecturer for Joyce class.\nPerhaps a representative anecdote would be useful.  On the first day of class, Kitcher ingressed in his usual manner and dress.  He went over to the computer and crooned, \"I really don't know how to work this thing!\"  A few pictures - Dublin in the twenties and the nineties, an ontogeny of Joyce - were shown, until the technophobic cry was repeated and someone came to the rescue.  \nThis should give you a pretty good idea of the timbre of Kitcher, and the timbre of his class.  His intellectual achievements dazzled anyone with the wherewithal to look them up - and, I'm guessing from the composition of the class, this was most everyone - but at core he's just an average White person who's a little smarter than the rest.  Of course, this meant that when he lectured about this dizzyingly complicated literature on simple subjects in plainspoken English, the class was all the more amazed.  Let it not be said that Kitcher doesn't know his shit: he loves the material, and he's put in enough time to synthesize a consistent view of everything from Dubliners to Finnegans Wake, and distill it down to a series of compelling lectures.\nThe problems with this class might have been mostly on my side, but I'm guessing that many of the students had many of the same issues that I did.  The bulk of the time is spent reading Ulysses (one lecture per chapter, roughly); Kitcher advised that we read it, then re-read it; I had difficulty getting through it once, with superficial readings, and I found that going to lecture and then reading, rather than vice versa, was the best way to attack this famously abstruse book.  But I didn't find it enjoyable, FW seemed just as absurd as ever, and I'd already read Dubliners and Portrait.  To quote Joyce: \"I remember nothing - only impressions, feelings\" - and this, along with my ambivalence towards the novels, probably explains my ambivalence towards the class as a whole.  At the end, Kitcher said, \"You've gotten a philosopher's take on Joyce,\" and it's worth bearing in mind that this is a work in progress - this is the first time Kitcher, taking over for Michael Seidel, has taught Joyce - and that it's hardly a typical English class.\nWorkload:\nA hard 3-page paper, an easier 6-page paper, a tough final that's mainly IDs from Ulysses.  Grade on the final seems horribly arbitrary.\n"

No matter how complex, the main points were driven home, with some interesting discussion in between.  I also do not think that it's fair to say that Kitcher picked favorites.  He did call on some people more often than others, but those were the people who tended to raise their hands.  Why pick on someone who clearly doesn't want to talk?  Furthermore, I think that even if he suspected someone had something not all that intelligent to share, he would still call on them and then go on to move the class effortlessly.  His grading is humourously easy.  I can't say for sure, but everyone I know got between a 93 and 100 on the midterm, and I woulddn't be surprised if it was the same for the final.  The essays (at least in my case) were graded similarly easily.  As long as you \"showed intelligence\" he seemed to like what you wrote.  He did like to repeatedly say how good our class was, but it still was a bit unbelievable.  Other than that, enjoy yourself and feel fortunate you were/are so lucky to have him as a teacher!

With his buttery British accent he proceeded to teach us philosophy in such a compelling way that we actually didn't spend half the class drawing pictures of his beard in our notebooks. We actually paid attention, in part because of his complete knowledge of every single aspect of each book that our class read, and as a result, grades on the midterm and final were stellar, not solely in part because of his gentle grading, because his teaching style made one *want* to do well. His humor was relentless, and he'd often break into hilarious Nazi lieutenant impressions or interpretations of people stuck in the Hobbesian State of Nature complete with flailing arms and cockney accents. His office hours were always available, and his midterm reviews were possibly the most helpful things ever. He'd go out of his way to make sure his students knew the material. He'd also often come up with insane philosophical mind experiments, complete with drawings on the blackboard (some of which the students actually partook in), with hilarious results. I must say, however, that his intelligence was intimidating, and made one worry about coming off sounding idiotic when writing a paper, in comparison. But perhaps he realized his own gangstasity and treated us with kids gloves as a result. Lastly, Mr. Kitcher invited us all over for dinner on the final day of class, and cooked DELICIOUS FISH. OH MY GOD IT WAS DELICIOUS. Of course, I must take points off from Kitcher for not giving us the recipe. I beseech you sir, please tell me how to cook such tender and moist bass.\nWorkload:\nTwo essays, a midterm, and a final. Nothing much, the essays are fine if you know how to read. Kitcher's review sessions will make the midterm and final sublimely fair, again if you know how to read.

Why hasn't this man won a teaching award?\nWorkload:\n5 books of less than 150 pages a piece, spread out evenly over the entire semester. The books are NON-ACADEMIC, usually good reading (except for one), and (although I didn't) probably could be skipped entirely. Kitcher summarizes them heavily in lecture. The papers are short, easy to write if you've been attending lecture, and come back with \"B\"s as long as they are complete sentences.\n"
