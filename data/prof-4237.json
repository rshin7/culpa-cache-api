He generally helped us understand the important points of the authors/philosophers we were studying. Interesting tangents, but a lot were relevant and informed the material. The only thing that annoyed me was that I\u2019d go into class thinking I knew something, but it never came up, or we discussed something completely different. As a testament to his reception from our class: at the end of the year, we all made him a scrapbook with photos, thank-you\u2019s, and what-I-learned\u2019s.\n\n\nWorkload:\nTypical for CC\n\n"
