            "review_content": "\nOne of the nicest and best french teachers I've ever had!  She is very sweet and patient and will make learning french a painless experience.  She has a very methodical and organized way of teaching, which I really appreciated because french can be very tricky what with all of the so called rules with a billion exceptions.  She's always giving extra helpful charts or tables to help clarify concepts which are not always so clear in the book.  She also tends to prefer to type lessons, examples, etc., on Word over the projector, which is a lot clearer for taking notes and organized than than writing on the chalkboard.  Sometimes language classes get a bit disorienting when you don't understand, but she's careful to try and put things in phrases we can understand.  If a concept is difficult to understand, she will go over it as much as necessary to ensure everyone understands.  She's also very approachable and straightforward with what will be on tests so there are never any surprises.  Everything on the test will be on something we've specifically went over in class.  And if the whole class doesn't do so well she'll give everyone a little curve.  She grades fairly (both on tests and compositions) but definitely not harshly.  Finally, she has a great accent.  I attended one section where the professors accent was so American--not the case with Anjali.  if you get the opportunity to be in her section--take it!  She's great.    \nWorkload:\nLight! No daily homework that's due and graded.  Most of the exercises she gave to us were optional and we would go over in class for our benefit.  The workbook exercises were due on the day of the test--don't wait to the last minute to them or you will suffer!  A 1 page double spaced composition was due every couple of weeks or so. Completely manageable.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAnjali is one of the nicest, kindest, best French teachers you could imagine. My French progressed amazingly over the course of the semester and she was always available outside of class to go over work, practice pronunciation or just chat. Anjali was always cheerful in class and managed to make even the most boring grammar topics both understandable and enjoyable. The workload was pretty standard for the French department. She did assign a few extra homework sheets towards the end of the semester but they were always helpful in solidifying difficult grammar topics and at least one of them counted for extra credit. She was also flexible with deadlines throughout the semester and really seemed to understand that this was not our only class and that at times other work could get a little overwhelming. The very first class was a little overwhelming as she speaks almost entirely in fairly rapid French from the start (something my Elementary I teacher did not do). But by the second week it just seemed completely natural and really improved my French. I really can't reccommend her highly enough and if you manage to get in with her you're in for a great semester. She really does make the language requirement as painless as possible.\nWorkload:\nPretty standard. Four tests over the semester, final exam and two oral exams (midterm and final). Occasional worksheets for homework.\n"
