There were a lot of beginner dancers that shouldn't have been in the class to begin with.\nFortunately, the class picked up towards the end. \nMs. Zalkind is sweet and wonderful... she's really nice about corrections and tries not to make anyone feel uncomfortable.  Very Relaxing class to say the least, and despite the slow pace, it improved my form a bit and was worth taking.  \nWorkload:\nexpected\n"
