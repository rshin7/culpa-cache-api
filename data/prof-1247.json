Liz is really nice and sweet, she never makes fun of anyone who dances like a moron or who is even overweight damaging the bar. afterall everyone loves her!\nWorkload:\nnone or lose some weight for those of you who wanna dance up easier--there are lots jumps and supporting to do...\n"

She's big on technique and is very good at explaining exactly what she wants you to do, even to the point of naming the specific muscle she wants you to use. When she gives corrections she is tactful and will work with you until you get it right, yet doesn't make you feel like you are being put on the spot. She is spunky, funny, and makes everyone feel like they are important. \n"

She is very serious about technique and to help you get it right she explains what muscles you should be using and will give as much individual attention as needed. She is energetic and fun and I can honestly say that I ENJOYED getting up for her class at 9.\n"
