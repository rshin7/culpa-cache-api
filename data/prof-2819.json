His lectures are a bit dry, but he's very willing to answer questions, both in class and at office hours. His midterms can be extremely hard, but he grades on a curve, so his grading is fair. \nWorkload:\nweekly homework assignments, two midterms, one final.\n"

His lectures were not dry (i.e. only definitions, theorems and proofs like a text book) but included many excellent examples and insight.  He really knows his stuff and speaks excellent english.  Furthermore, he was always well prepared in class and helpful in office hrs. \nWorkload:\na not-too-difficult problem set every week (problem sets were 50% of the grade) plus a relatively easy midterm and final\n"
