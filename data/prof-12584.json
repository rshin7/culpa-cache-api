This class widened my scope and provided me with useful tools to analyze human rights, gender studies, politics, and relationships in general through a wider lens. Professor Sameh introduced me to several great feminist authors, yet she made it seem like I was reading for fun instead of a workload. The class has no TAs, Professor Sameh is a great lecturer, very engaging and knows how to explain the material. Attendance is mandatory, but I don't know why anyone would miss her lectures. Great class overall!\nWorkload:\nAttendance is mandatory\nWeekly readings 40-50 pages\ntwo short response papers 3-4 pages\nOne Midterm/paper 8-10 pages\nOne open note final \n"
