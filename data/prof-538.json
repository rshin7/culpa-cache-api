            "review_content": "\nI disagree with his having a silver star. I know I'm in the minority with that belief. But let me justify my claim: Prof. Berghahn is an exceptional lecturer, and well regarded by most taking his class. He's a great man and really cares about teaching and about students. That said, although his lectures are generally engaging and for the most part well organized, I felt like I didn't get that much out of them. He always had important points to make but I felt like the critical analysis just wasn't there, or when it was, it had no edge to it. In other words, critical engagement was often sacrificed for narrative, statistics, or anecdote. Sometimes, he will make banal platitudes about the importance of perspective in doing history, but never really said anything that made you think really hard after the lecture. It was easy to just go, type a few notes on the lecture, leave, and not think about it again until the final; similarly, discussion section was typically dry--\"so, what do we notice about this document?\" type of stuff. This class really didn't achieve what I think Humanities pedagogy is supposed to achieve. While I certainly do not regret taking the class, I definitely won't look back on this class as having shaped my intellectual development in any significant way. I'm sure the auditors--who took up literally the first 5-6 rows of seats--got more out of this class than I did. I don't mean to disrespect Prof. Berghahn, who's a great man and a tremendous scholar (prof. emeritus!), but I feel like there are much stronger professors in the History dept., ones that will really challenge you to grow and think critically.\nWorkload:\nFairly light. One 7-8 page essay on Schindler's Ark [Schindler's List] and a 15-16 page final essay, with suggested prompts or design-your-own. I've heard Prof. Berghahn himself grades more easily than the TAs, and there may be a hint of truth to that (quote: \"If it were up to me, I'd just give everybody As and A+s because I'm sure you all are very bright\"). Straightforward final, I think, but haven't taken it yet. As others have mentioned, reading is basically optional.\n"

He is a very fair grader- probably a bit generous at times - and he is always happy to meet with students. Berghahn is one of the best professors I have ever had. Also he does a good job of choosing TA's all of them were really nice.\nWorkload:\nVery reasonable. Reading every week but a lot of people don't read and still do well. One short paper (7-8 pages) which is quite manageable on All Quiet on the Western Front, one longer paper (15-16 pages, choose your own topic with Berghahn), and an easy final as long as you were in class.\n"

Unlike many professors in the history dept., you can sense his genuine interest in making students understand the material. Anyone interested in taking this course to learn about the Holocaust should look elsewhere, as the factors leading up to it and its ramifications are the true focus of mid-century lectures. Berghahn tries (and mostly succeeds) on showing different aspects of Germany society, politics, and culture. I'd advise actually going to lectures and taking good notes, since the exam questions are essentially lecture topics. A great course overall made possible by a wonderful professor.\nWorkload:\nLight reading (a few chapters and primary source docs every week), but heavy writing. \n7-8 page paper on All Quiet on the Western Front which is fairly easy.\n15-16 page paper on either an assigned topic (which your TA will grade) or you can chose your own topic in consultation with Berghahn, in which case he grades it. Unless you really have a topic you are interested in, I'd advise writing one of the assigned topics since he recommends sources to use. \nVery fair in-class final exam in which you pick 3/12 essay options. The review session is pretty helpful and I'd recommend preparing vague outlines for the major periods of each to study (Weimar, 1930 Nazis, post-WW2 reconstruction, East-West divide, etc).\n\n"

This class was an absolute pleasure: interesting, provocative, engaging and empowering.\nProf. Berghahn's kind nature and brilliant mind come through in his teaching style -- his lectures are perfectly organized (and he even provides a brief recap of the previous class meeting which is very helpful), he had a soft-spoken and kind demeanor, and he truly welcomes questions. When I visited him during Office Hours, he seemed undistracted and genuinely interested in my questions and my well-being in general. His review of my classwork was at once thorough, rigorous and encouraging. He comes with an understated brilliance that is inspiring.\nOn the basis of this classroom experience, I would take virtually any course that Prof. Berghahn offers.\nWorkload:\nVery fair: a short paper, a longer paper and an in-class final.

What will make you love this class are his personal anecdotes about being a teenager or child post-WWII Germany and driving a \"bubble car,\" etc. Professor Berghahn himself is probably one of the nicest and most accomodating professors I will ever have. For example, the final this semester was scheduled for the 20th of December, and he is allowing me to take an alternate version (that he has to write) on the 14th with \"probably a couple other students\" so that I can go home earlier and pay less for a plane ticket. His exact words were \"Why don't you figure out when would be best for you to leave and we can schedule it before that.\" \nBeyond why I personally appreciate this class solely for the professor, its taught mostly on the basis of conflicting historical theories about German history, which is an interesting way to teach the subject matter. Beyond that, this is a really interesting part of European history. I would highly recommend this class and this professor.\nWorkload:\nOne 6-8 page critical analysis of a historical book, 12-16 page final research paper on one of three topics or one of your choice (if you do one of your choice, Prof. Berghahn grades it and I heard he grades easier than some TA's), and a final of 12 questions of which you must answer 3 in the allotted time.

            "review_content": "\nWretched, incomparable disappointment. This is the worst class I have taken from the otherwise excellent History department. It is difficult to believe that a course taught by a so-called distinguished professor for so many years can still seem like such a poorly organized train wreck. True, Volker could feign benevolence, granting the same post-Thanksgiving extension on the research paper he does every year (were he to merely readjust the due date on the syllabus, the opportunity to seem as if a warm and caring instructor would of course be lost). He will take the time to meet with you and recommend sources on your papers as well, but only up to a point (and will grade based on preconceptions he somehow gleaned from these meetings which may have little or nothing to do with the subject or contents of such papers- in fact, for all his reputed easy grading, my book review paper was far more generously graded by the otherwise notorious TAs). I found all his purported warmth to be as disingenuous as that of a department store Santa Claus. And as others have mentioned, the intellectual caliber of the class hardly compensates; if you do glean anything from lectures (most likely in the form of some obscure detail), it will not be in any coherently presented fashion- Volker will flit between tenuously connected topics, claim he is lecturing on one subject and deliver another, and spend, for a European history course, far too much time talking about America and the Far East. There was no attempt, by the end of the course, to summarize its contents and to present any structural or theoretical grounds for European decline, which rendered this course little better than a poorly developed survey. Not highly recommended.\nWorkload:\nFar too much for a lecture class- one 7-8 page book review, one 18 page research paper, which can be on a number of preconceived topics or one of your own, in which case Volker gives you research guidance and grades your work. Sections are not required, nor is knowing the reading for exams, so both can be easily foregone.\n"

Volker cares - he always has a big smile on his face in the front of the class, lectures without notes, is awesome to meet with in person, etc. (I feel like he'd be an awesome seminar professor), but this class is really boring. I'm a history major, and I usually love going to my history classes because the professors say such interesting new things about the subject, or shed some new light on an event or period - but this class taught me nothing that I felt like I couldn't learn instead by staying home and reading wikipedia. It was a real disappointment. I stopped going half way through the semester.\nThe workload for this class is also too much. A 7-8 page book review and 15-17 page research paper - for a maximum total of 25 pages is more pages than were assigned for my 4 point seminar, and more than my other three history classes this past semester combined. People seemed to love \"Homage to Catalonia\" - but its a very difficult book to review (and I thought it was dull). That paper was also graded harshly. I chose to do my own topic for the research paper, but after deciding to pass/fail this class, I did a pretty terrible job (and yet, still received the same grade on it as the book review that I actually worked at). \nI would avoid this class, I had high hopes for it, and it was a huge letdown. Volker's great though - if you have the chance to take a more intimate class with him, I'd strongly recommend it. This class though - skip over it.\nWorkload:\nOne 7-8 page paper (book review), one 15-17 page paper (research paper), no midterm. Final asking 3/12 questions - one from each war period. \n"

He gives the option of attending a discussion section and then each of your papers and your final will count less when calculating your end grade. While this sounds ideal, do not do it. \nWhile you may think that it will be easy to get an A in the discussion section it is not worth it because if you are in a discussion section your TA will grade your papers. The TAs grade unfairly. If you are not in a discussion section, while the papers and tests will count more, you are more likely to do better on them, because Professor Berghahn will grade the papers himself, which is ideal.

He tended to spend the first third of each lecture recapping the previous lecture, almost as if he were encouraging you to skip every other class. Worse still, the course amounted to nothing more than a rambling survey of early 20th century history. One day he'll spend a third of the lecture going on a tangent about railroads and standardized time, another day he'll devote the entire class to Nazi racist policies. Sure, some bits of trivia in the lectures were interesting, but what was the point to it all? If there was some method to this madness, it completely passed me by.

Nevertheless, because he can go on and on it is difficult to take notes since if you miss a sentence you can be confused the entire lecture.  The reading list was pretty bad - and I really didn't like the Orwell book although everyone else said it was the \"peak\" of the reading list.  Sections could be either great or godawful depending on which TA you're assigned to.  The research paper is insightful and if you choose your own topic he'll read it himself (and give very kind feedback).
