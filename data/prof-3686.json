            "review_content": "\nLehecka and Delbanco are the shit.  This class is brilliant.  Take it if you have ANY interest in education whatsoever.  The reading is well chosen and thought provoking.  That being said, the assignments are several hundred pages of reading a week.  So, take this class when you've got some free time (ie not when you're in CC or Lit Hum).  This seminar is worth it.  Google Lehecka and Delbanco, and you'll be so appreciative that you get to be in a room with them and have one on one discussions with them.  They are fascinating people.  Course admittance is by interview, so Lehecka knows everyone in the seminar and hand picks people.  Discussions are really interesting.  Note: Lehecka and Delbanco are probably the slowest speakers on the whole campus - but they're also saying some deep shit.  We also had Prezbo come talk to us about affirmative action.  So boss.  So glad that I had the opportunity to take this course.  \nThere's also a volunteering component of the course at the Double Discovery Center. It's 4 hours a week, so yes, time commitment. But if you care about improving education, then this will be a valuable resource.  Plus the DDC is on campus and the students there are driven, so it's a pretty great experience.  \nWorkload:\nHeavy reading, 3 super easy papers (ie talk about your feelings and reference papers), a few meetings with Lehecka (which is great - he offers career advice and actually cares about you)\n"
