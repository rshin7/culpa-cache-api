This is the hardest I\u2019ve ever worked in any class and barely scraped by with a okay grade. She seems like a nice person in class, however when it comes to grading I\u2019ve never dealt with a more unfair teacher. Whether I put 1 hour or 150 hours into a paper the grade would be the same. \nS T A Y    A W A Y \nWorkload:\nJust the same as every other lit hum class\n"
