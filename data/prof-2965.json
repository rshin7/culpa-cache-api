He's not your typical Columbia math grad student (that is, a super-undergrad); he understands the material like a professor, carries himself like a professor, and teaches like a professor. He has a very disciplined style and works example problems with clarity and thoroughness.   If Shaffiq is teaching a class, take it!\nWorkload:\nThis was a summer course, and we had something like 20 homework assignments, so I was working literally every night on this class. Midterm and non-cumulative final, both of which were difficult, but still doable. Five quizzes, which ranged from very easy to impossibly hard (the quizzes counted for only 10%, luckily).\n"
