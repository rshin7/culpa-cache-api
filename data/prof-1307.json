            "review_content": "\nValentini is definitely a nice guy who is passionate about this subject.  He tries really hard to make the material and lectures interesting.\nThe slow pace of the first half of the semester left the second half rushed and there were topics left uncovered.  We spent an insane amount of time on aspects of particle-in-a-box (a section of a chapter) that I'm not sure were even looked at in other sections of Gen Chem 1 just to end up spending very little time on the entirety of chapter 14 (which was probably 50% of the second part of the final exam).  \"Element of the Day\" is kind of a pain and just a way to get people to attend lecture because he doesn't post the element information anywhere.  Like a previous reviewer mentioned, a diligent friend is good to have.\nA good TA is a must.  My TA, Colin, was a nice guy but his inexperience managing a classroom showed and every 50-minute recitation was unstructured and inefficient - serving only to make me feel resentful of the fact that I had to pay for that half-credit.\nExams - 20 questions, multiple choice, sometimes ambiguously worded.  If you think combined answer choices (i.e. all of the above, none of the above, D) A and C, E) A, B, and C) are frustrating or  annoying, then don't take this class.  Every exam average (including the finals) was around 15 out of 20 -- with 1-5 ppl out of 180 scoring a 20/20.\nAlthough there was definitely a GPA-friendly curve, the class feels a bit like a waste because I did not leave with a good understanding of the coursework.  \n\nWorkload:\n5 quizzes, 1 dropped (20%)\n3 exams + a 2-part final = 5 , 1 of which is dropped (each worth 20%)\nWeekly HW assigned, but not collected or graded - definitely do the Additional Questions, they will help you on the exams\n"

            "review_content": "\nI took Gen Chem because of my SEAS requirement, and have zero interest in chemistry. This class did not help. Although Valentini tried to make the class interesting and relevant for all, most of the lectures assumed a knowledge far beyond \"general\", and the class wound up degenerating into a free-for-all between the more motivated students and the GS kids. I didn't take AP chemistry in high school, but I had friends in the class who did, and even they struggled to keep up. Valentini, however, really has perfected his lecture-style teaching style, and is very willing to meet with students whenever.\nHad it not been for my TA during the required recitation period, I would not have passed this course. During recitation there's a 4-point quiz, and then the TA is supposed to review questions. My TA, Emma, went above and beyond, distilling all the knowledge presented in class into exactly what we needed to know to get through the course. \nThe class covers a brief history of atomic theory, quantum mechanics, and atomic structure. I learned a lot, but really taught it to myself between doing extra textbook work and using the workbook (which you should absolutely get and use, the summaries are very helpful!). It's not really necessary to go to class; Valentini posts lectures & assignments online, and the mandatory recitations will cover anything else you need to know. There is this weird thing he did called \"Element of the Day\" but its not a frequent thing and if you have a diligent friend you should be fine. \nWorkload:\nSix quizzes during recitation, four points each, one of them drops. Some TA's will let you make up missed questions for half credit.\nThree exams and a final in two parts, each with 20 1pt multiple choice questions. The lowest of all five drops.\nHomework is optional, but you should do it to prepare for the exams, and maybe your quizzes depending on your TA.\n"

His exams are very tough and the material he assigns as homework is hard to decipher because he assigns work which he doesn't touch upon in class and then mentions that we don't have to know it for the exam.. so why assign it in the first place??\nRegardless, due to the fact that I wasn't doing well I seeked his help and although he didn't help me DO better, he certainly showed concern and tried to strategize with me. He is very available to talk and it ended up being that we met weekly to debrief about the studying I was doing. He continuously tried to help me develop better studying habits in order to improve on the exams.\nHe is very kind and entertaining. He wants to get to know his students and I truly appreciate this because that's rare in Columbia.\nWorkload:\nWeekly quizzes, 3 exams, readings and problem sets that aren't checked (and almost aren't relevant to the lectures).\n"

            "review_content": "\nValentini is a great, caring lecturer who always comes prepared and enthusiastic to talk about and answer any questions about chemistry. In the beginning of the semester, I dreaded the 9:10 start to the class, but it actually turned out quite well, given the interesting applications that he presents (e.g. Sony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PS3 and spherical harmonics) and the stories he occasionally told us about his son, among other things. He gives an excellent overview of the general concepts that should be grasped and constantly (and successfully) relates back to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153four things you need to know to become a chemist\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the microscopic world. I thought he did a good job in filling the holes in my knowledge of chem by introducing, in an understandable fashion, difficult topics like quantum mechanics and Schrondinger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equation, which really help explain molecular orbital theory and clarify why elements in the periodic table behave as they do. The discussions about semi-conductor were also extremely entertaining. If you are genuinely interested in chemistry, take any class with Prof. V, as he will fill your brain with incredible amounts of information and make you stronger than ever in this subject if you can digest the material. \n\nWorkload:\nWeekly optional homework (not graded), but crucial to doing well on the 8 recitation quizzes (4 points each, drop lowest 2 grades) -> The only complaint I have for the HW is that the answers to the additional problems may sometimes have quite a few mistakes, which can get frustrating and confusing. Three midterms (25 points each, drop the lowest grade) -> Doable B, but to get an A, you really need to have some talent, or prior exposure to chem. before this course,  and be able to figure out questions that you have never seen before by applying certain concepts you already understand. Make sure to watch out for units by following dimensional analysis in calculations. Tricky roman numeral questions here and there and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153none of the above\u00e2\u20ac\u009d choices can get quite annoying sometimes. Good training for future chemistry classes, but can be tough for those simply here to fulfill a requirement (premed or SEAS) and not really interested in the subject matter. Final exam (50 points). 124 points in total. Hard work does pay off in the end and a holistic (I think) curve is given for the final letter grades.\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Valentini is a very nice guy and seems as though enjoys teaching but he isn't very good at it.  Yes he'll answer all of your questions but what he covers in class doesn't really help you at all.  He uses a slide show for all of his lectures which don't tell you very much.  He also goes very slow so he'll skip important points or stay on one topic to the point where what he says isn't useful at all.  We once spent 2 lectures doing one problem when the actual problems in the book and on the test were much easier than this one.  This made class in general very boring and on top of the fact that the class was at 9:10 nearly half of the class didn't show up at all after about the 3rd lecture.\nThe recitation sections are where you'll learn what you need to know so pay good attention to them.  Also do the readings and the homework assignments he assigns.  Even though they aren't collected you'll learn a lot more from these than the lectures.  Make sure you go through the practice exams he posts as well since a lot of it(not all) will be very similar to the actual tests\nWorkload:\nNot much at all.  Readings, homeworks that are never collected.  8 Recitation quizzes, 6 of them counted.  3 midterms, 2 of them counted.  1 final. Final and midterms are all multiple choice.\n"

His humor can be very dry, and he will make Monty Python jokes with such a straight face that you may not catch them. He spends a perhaps excessive amount of time on particle-in-a-box/infinite square well. \nHomework is not collected, but rather assessed in the form of a short (TA-written) quiz in weekly discussion sections. I could personally never figure out exactly what was going to be on the quiz, since it didn't always coincide with the homework material.\nThere are three midterm-ish exams and a two-part final. Both are based entirely off material from the quizzes (all quizzes and their solutions are posted prior to exams) and he drops the lowest grade out of those five.\nWorkload:\nGenerally light. Homeworks are not collected, but it is recommended to look over them and their solutions in preparation for the weekly quiz. Exams are extremely easy to prepare for.\n"

Super nice guy.  Quizzes are about 20% of your grade and a bit tricky.  Pay attention to what your TAs say in recitation as TAs contribute to quiz questions.  I realize now that many test (midterm/final) questions were based on the class slides so study them well.  Class slides, Professor Valentini's comments and homeworks (especially additional problems) are more important than reading the book.  Test questions can also be a bit tricky with nuances that sometimes are demoralizing.  But as long as you stay consistently above the curve -- and Professor Valentini is super-organized about administration so you always know where you stand -- you can do well.  Plus, he's very fair about the way point system works in grading.  If you don't do well in something it's not end of the world (you can drop 2 of 8 quizzes, you can drop 1 of 5 25-point exams (you have three 25-point midterms and two 25-point parts to final exam, you can add 9 points to your total semester score count by writing good, sample test question with explanations before each of three midterm exams).  Overall, I highly recommend Professor Valentini and his class.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI felt like this class was a joke.  At first it seemed okay, with Valentini going for a more conceptual understanding of chemistry.  And I did the first homework with the intent of handing it in.  But then I found out homework wasn't collected, and I never did homework after that.  After the quiz, I also found that class was not really helpful either, as all that conceptual stuff didn't help with calculations and stuff.  Maybe the homework would have compensated for that, but I didn't have the drive.  Class should have been helping me, and it didn't.  The thing is the class was easy enough so that I could survive the quizzes and midterms with just studying the night before.  I ended up getting a B+ with not even really trying that much, so take that for what it's worth.  Valentini is not a bad choice I guess if you don't want to do that much work. Grading is fair, one grade equivalent to a midterm or one of the finals is dropped.  The midterms were tricky for no reason, with multiple choice questions with all and none of the above, or A and C or B and D as another choice. Maybe you're better off with Parkin; I think he is more straightforward.\nWorkload:\nWeekly homework assignment (not collected), weekly quizzes (two were dropped), 3 midterms (somewhat difficult), 2 finals (one covered the first half, the second the second half; in one 3 hr session, each is about 1 hr and 15 min.)\n"

Usually, quizzes are taken during recitation but one week there was no quiz and my TA wasn't able to make it to recitation. The recitation was going to be devoted to reviewing for an upcoming midterm. Instead of just canceling the recitation, Valentini himself came in to teach for the 10 or so people in my recitation section.\nLectures can be boring at times, but Valentini logically orders the material so that it makes sense.

            "review_content": "\nIn my honest opinion, I found Professor Valentini to be alright, wasn't the best professor I ever had and he wasn't the worst. After having Len Fine my first semester of G.Chem, I was relieved that Valentini's powerpoint presentations were clear, organized and informative and that he generally gets them up on the website with a day or two after lecture. The lecture generally consisted of Valentini opening the floor to some \"stupid\" (his words) questions about the material, he would crack a couple of jokes about his unpopularity with the undergrads that didn't come to lecture, would do a couple of demonstations and then he would lecture for the remaining period of time. The material is very boring and that was reflected in Valentini's lectures. Again, not the worst professor in the world, but at the same time, he would lecture on a topic for one or two lectures and would rush through the \"real chemistry\" and then he would spend what seemed like hours on irrelevant material such as testing the pH of dodge's pool. I would have preferred if the \"practical applications\" of chemistry were done away with and that we had more in class practice with questions and that more of the textbook material done were presented lecture. \nOur exams consisted of 25 multiple choice questions and I felt our first exam was very unreasonable. It was long, difficult and did not reflect the material we learned or were responsible to know for the exam. He doesn't curve the class and his grading ranges are too rigid. Overall, a much better professor than Professor Fine, but can bore you to death in lecture and seems a little unsympathetic regarding the difficulty of his exams. (Most people did not finish our first exam in 75 minutes (including myself) and when told that the exam was a little too long for the time alotted, all he could say was \"well you should be able to do that exam in 35 minutes\"). Most people said he was personable and approachable, I felt he was a little indifferent at times. \nWorkload:\nManageable. 3 exams, one final. 10 recitation quizzes and three \"sample\" exam questions. \n"

Material is boring though, well no complains coz it is G chem you gotta go through the boring stuffs all the time....it is at least the most fun one among all premed requirements.\nWorkload:\nokay, less than Fine's, and NO CHEMWRITE!, thank God, this man understands his students' pain...\n"

            "review_content": "\n\"Will you be my neighbor?\" That is the best way to describe Valentini. He would be perfect for teaching a class of 1st graders. He goes very slow and is very clear, and holds your hand through EVERYTHING. But that is a plus and a minus. You will sit there bored as hell if you already know chemistry, but if you don't know any you'll be thanking god Fine isn't up there teaching. To get a good grade you have to just use you \"tool box\" as he calls it. Basically, just don't go to class. Night before the test look through all his slides and memorize whatever is in gold and you're set for the exam.\nWorkload:\n3 tests, final, chemwrite, rec quizes\n"

            "review_content": "\nAwesome. Awesome, awesome, awesome. At the risk of sounding repetitive, I will say it again: awesome. Professor Valentini (Jim) is great. He's enthusiastic about the material he teaches, interested in hearing what you have to say, encourages us to critically evaluate the articles we read, and in general, leads a great discussion. The class is Friday afternoons, which I thought would be quite a pain, but the time really flew. All in all, a great class. \nWorkload:\nFair, although a bit much for a pass/fail class. Have to read two science articles for every class and write an evaluation. Final project of a 20 minute talk and 5 page paper. You'll pass as long as you do something; if you do a good job, you'll really laern a HELL of alot about chemistry and research in general.\n"
