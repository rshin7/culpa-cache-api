However, the amount of work she gives is absurd (compared to other classes like Lit Hum or Calc 1). She always expects something equal to a 1-2 page essay every class along with the 20-40 page reading she assigned you so that you can do the writing part.\nWorkload:\nToo much. At least 2 hours per class (so 4 hours a week).\n"
