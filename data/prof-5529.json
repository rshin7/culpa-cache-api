            "review_content": "\nA very good course on continuum mechanics. Panides starts the course right from the engineering math and vector calculus and doesn't expect you to know any fluid mechanics, but an undergrad course will be useful. You'll have to take copious notes as these will be extremely useful for the exams. Panides goes over the course at an easy pace so that the students can understand everything. The TA, Jon Kyle, was really helpful and solved quite a few problems before the exams.\nThe second half gets a bit tough, but you expect that considering it is a 6000-level course.\nWorkload:\n9 optional homework assignments, not graded. \nMidterm and final exam, Each 50% of the grade.\n"
