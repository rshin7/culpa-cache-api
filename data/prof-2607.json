            "review_content": "\nAlthough he is young, don't be fooled.  Simon conducted a very thorough class.  He taught the class based on who was there and the speed at which the material was grasped by the class.  He provided examples that he went through in detail (sometimes too much detail) and went out of his way to accomodate students who were unable to make it to his designated office hours.  The tests were designed to see if you actually understood the material, which was great due to the fact that this course is purely preparatory for the fall physics courses.  I feel as though, after having been away from college for ten years, that I am on a more equal footing with all those coming straight from high school.  Simon proved himself to be a very promising professor; understanding, articulate and actually wanted to have the material he taught understood by the class.  Although he is stll a graduate student, he was a breath of fresh air.\nWorkload:\nvery light (course is taken for no credit, purely preparatory).  Two exams, both open notes, and no calculators.  (problems were adjusted so this was not an impossible feat). Occasional problems to be completed and handed in for grading. Approx 4 assignments over the 6 weeks.\n"
