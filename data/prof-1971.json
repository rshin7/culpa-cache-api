            "review_content": "\nTake classes from her.  She's glamorous (think Marilyn Monroe hair with heels and a fur coat) and  unbelievably brilliant.  She conveys her passion to her students.  Her intelligence can come off as a bit intimidating at times, but if you talk and show interest you'll get so much out of her classes.  She's fairly flexible with the syllabus and really wants you to do well.  For someone who seems to do a thousand things at once she makes herself unbelievably accessible (I missed class because I was sick and she called me on my cell phone to talk about a paper I was worried about).  Concerning papers, she's not just concerned with structure, she is more concerned about content and really challenging your thinking.  Take her classes, you will NOT regret it.  Let's put it this way - I decided to take her classes for a full year.\n\nWorkload:\nModerate.  Sometimes she'll have you read a book a week, sometimes only a few articles.  She's flexible.  Papers - about 4 a semester with the option of turning in a rough draft (highly recommended).\n"

If she does seem arrogant that is because she knows what she is doing. Because she cared so much, it made me care. I worked really hard in her class and she would spend hours sitting down with me to revise all the 10 drafts of my paper. I never had a professor that was so devoted to her students. I could really speak to her and it would be okay if I got angry or sad, because she understood. I would love to take another class with her. She is a tough grader, but she is willing to work with you. My writing definitely improved.\nWorkload:\n2 paper and 1 research paper\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Steinkoler is awesome. Seriously, these reviews of her that are negative, throw them out. I admit, I had my doubts when I first met her as well. But as the class progressed, I LOVED HER! She is brilliant, intelligent, inquisitive, caring, smart and maybe a little bit self-absorbed but that's okay. (Actually if you ever get a chance to talk to her about her life, you'll find she doesn't think so much of herself after all). Her lectures are very interesting and very low-stress. Their actually fun to go to (most of the time) because their so interesting. It isn't that reading intensive, rather, her style is to look at parts of the book and passages that spark interest and relates them to so many other things and changes your perceptions about things you never even thought of. You'll learn a lot from her! What is this about her not caring about her students? That's such a lie. If you ever have a problem with your paper, you can always come to her or e-mail her. She makes herself very available during office hours. If you ever have a problem, she's lenient with extensions on papers and is very understanding. She encourages you to meet with her and discuss your paper. She also wants you to express your own ideas, just be prepared to back them up. She's also good at working with your own ideas to develop into a clear argument (however, this is sometimes confusing because she might contradict herself if you discuss it with her later). She doesn't necessarily shoot down ideas during lectures, but she'll tell you if she doesn't agree with them. Overall, a great class and an awesome professor, definitely take her for First-Year English or Seminar!  \nWorkload:\nModerate/Light. The usual readings every week about 30-50 pages per class, 3 papers 4-7 pages each. \n"

By the end of the course I had a completely different view of her. I was angry when I received a B on a first draft I had worked hard on, but her suggestions were on point and my writing undoubtedly improved. Professor Steinkoler's haughtiness is offset by her terrific sense of humor and love of the absurd. She is able to incorporate moments of levity into some pretty dense literature. The fact that I laughed and didn't cry when we read Milton says a lot. Take her class, throw out your preconceptions and crappy CULPA reviews and enjoy her class.\nWorkload:\nLight. 2 4-6 page papers and 1 8-10 page research paper. \n"

            "review_content": "\nArrogance is the word that comes to mind when asked to describe Steinkoler.  I got to know her through the many visits to her office hours and she really is a very intelligent, capable woman who is just full of knowledge regarding psychology, literature, and politics.  But hit on a topic that she doesn't know much about... and she will somehow link it to something she can talk about and then go on for another hour. She loves to hear herself talk and loves to win arguments.\nThat said, she is a great lecturer, she can go for hours on interesting topics and I found everything she said to be fascinating.  But first-year english at Barnard was designed to be a discussion-based class, where students can exchange OUR ideas about great works of literature rather than listen to a professor drone on about her ideas (which she seemed to believe was the only right answer).  \nExample: I spent about 2 weeks writing my first paper, exploring creative ideas and doing a lot of research to back it... and she returned it with a D+ written on it.  So I re-wrote the paper in one night, reiterating everything she lectured about the book in class and reinforcing her opinions and ideas and got an A. \nI would happily go to her lectures, but in my opinion Barnard made a mistake when they asked her to lead a discussion-based class.\nWorkload:\n2 papers, and probably a rewrite for each,  and a final research paper. No rewrite allowed for the final research paper. -- Most students in the class didn't bother to do the massive amounts of reading because she didn't allow us to talk in class anyways.\n"

It's most likely true that the commentary she offers for a given text come from other writers, but I'd be disappointed if it were otherwise. It's really the students' who are supposed to be learning to think and therefore offering original commentary. Her style is to give us all that's been said so far and to allow for class discussions. Her personality is so open and generous that I felt as if our entire class relaxed and just offered up whatever thoughts came to their minds. A professor who can create a sense of ease like this is a rarity, a gem to find. And just given the material she chooses alone -- as compared to many other professors -- her classes are well worth taking. She's also accessible and lenient, and though we had a few students who didn\u00c2\u2019t speak the language too well and others whose comments really missed the point, she demonstrate a sort of easy grace, which, again, resulted in a general sense of ease and good feelings.\nWorkload:\nA lot of reading, not as much writing as she could have assigned. Her idea with writing was that she wanted us to work on our weaknesses. She therefore gave a generous amount of notation, from which it was very easy to understand just exactly what she was looking for in the next draft.\n"

She may know about Freud and psychoanalysis, but does not care much for English literature itself, which this class should be about. She mixed up characters, read off disorganized scribbled notes, and totally ignored a comment if it conflicted with her ideas. An extremely hilarious moment in class was when she gave us an overview of Greek history; what she did was print off a timeline from the Internet and picked up important events and nervously read them to us--One good thing about this woman is that she knows A LOT about NYC; she'll give you tons of info on lectures that you can attend for extra credit (of course, on psychoanalysis but these for the most part are really good), museums, operas, and even tango classes.  Her grading isn't that bad; a bit strict on the first draft and she only has minimal office hours which she skips when she's \"tired\", but not that different from other First Year English profs. She's pretty lax with deadlines; she'll tell you that she only extends deadlines for emergencies, but if you give her a pretty good reason she'll give you an extra week pretty easily.  \nWorkload:\nSame or slightly lighter than other First Year English classes: 2 5-6 page papers, and a 10 page final research paper. She doesn't require you to write essays on the supplemental lectures, which some other profs did.\n"

She apparently forgets that she is teaching freshman in college who come from all walks of life and need help rather than bashing behind the back.
