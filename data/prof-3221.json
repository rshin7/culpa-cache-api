Her discussion sections were always engaging, funny, and so helpful compared to the confusing lectures by the professor. My only complaint is that the discussions weren't long enough. The time flew by listening to her insights and having her open up discussions and playing off on what the students said. She was a very helpful grader, always giving good feedback and being available to help whenever she could. Definitely if you can, get her for any class. Your life will be so much better. \nWorkload:\nThe class had two take home midterms and an in class final - none of which she controlled, but again, her grading was fair. \n"
