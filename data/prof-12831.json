Colgrove is at once insightful, brilliant, wonderfully articulate, and an expert deadpanner. He is a maestro of the powerpoint, filling it with media from videos, 19th century magazines, newspapers, and other documents to illustrate the colorful history of public health in America. \nThe class material is well chosen, and the readings are substantial but on the slightly shorter side for a history class and could be skimmed because Colgrove is so crystal clear about the important takeaways in his lecture that you hardly have to take notes. If you do, a quick glance at them a week later would re-tell the narrative of that class. You'd be missing out to skip the readings, though, nearly all of which were worthwhile. \nShout-out to TA Ian Shin, an exceptional discussion section leader. He brought further insight into the texts, compared them well, and helped us synthesize and consider the broader narratives of the course. He was accessible for help week to week, and literally cleared his schedule to support us come midterm and final papers. \nDo yourself a favor and take anything Colgrove teaches. \n\nWorkload:\nreading for each class (~125-175 pages/week)\nMidterm 5 page secondary source historiographical review on a topic of your choice in the history of public health\nFinal 12pg primary source paper plugging in a gap in the historical understanding of your midterm paper topic\n"
