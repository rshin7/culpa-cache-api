Samir is really nice, and not very hard, but he's not a very good teacher. He speaks really slowly and writes even slower, and doesn't really understand the idea that Arabic is different than English and expects everyone to grasp pronunciation and grammatical form immediately without his explanation. He also forgets what he teaches, and teaches straight from the book. As long as you ask a lot of questions when he contradicts himself, things are okay, and it wasnt a hard class.\nWorkload:\nhours and hours and hours of homework, departmental quizzes every other week that weren't hard, and a final\n"
