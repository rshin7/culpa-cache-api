The class itself, on the other hand, was just awkward. The class meeting itself focussed largely on introducing pages upon pages of public health/ethnic studies vocab, which made the discussions slow, confusing, and impossible to focus on. Discussions were often riddled with long, uncomfortable silences, and lengthy but often useless explanations from Sel.\nWorkload:\n~100 double-sided pages of dense reading a week. Hard to tell what's necessary/helpful.300 word journal entry for each class.Take-home midterm (10ish pages)Take-home final (10ish pages)\n"
