His personal background and story really allow him to delve into the text in a very personal manner and he's really dedicated to making sure students do well in the class. He has a weird sense of humor at times which can make things kind of awkward in class and on the first day he told us he doesn't believe in A's. So if you're looking for an interesting class with a huge participation grade, but hard grading, pick this course. \n\nWorkload:\n2 papers (6-8) \nMidterm \nFinal\n\n"
