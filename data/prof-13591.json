Better than any grad student, and some professors I've had, at clearly distilling contemporary questions in CS into engaging presentations and activities. I think she (and the program generally) are limited by dated course material, but the lectures that Bailey personally developed were interesting and well-designed. It is clear that she is VERY passionate about the topics she has taken coursework in, and her efforts in office hours and outside of class really made the comp sci department feel like a more welcoming place for me. I don't know where Bailey is going next, but for our sake I hope she keeps teaching in some way\nWorkload:\nI don't think this course is meant to add a lot of extra work to your life. Show up and engage with the lecture/activities and you'll pass\n"
