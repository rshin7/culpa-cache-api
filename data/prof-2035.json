            "review_content": "\nThe worst thing about this course is that there was no textbook. For every problem set or exam preperation, my class found ourselves examining our notes for that little equation we may or may not have copied off the board. Readings mostly consisted of fascinating journal articles which were beyond the scope of the course.\nThe lectures are well organized but soporific. Jules is very smart but not an amazing professor. If you are interested in the topic, you should be able to overcome the difficulties and learn a lot. I really liked the course.\nWorkload:\n7-10 challenging problem sets, hard midterm, extremely hard final, but a decent curve.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Halpern obviously loves what he does. His knowledge of the field is apparent. This class is a great opportunity to learn a little bit more about what, exactly, astronomers do. Most of the course is conducted as a series of weekly guest lecturers. Some of the material is quite technical, but you do not have to have much background in the subject to take the class. I would recommend it to anyone who is unsure about majoring in astronomy/astrophysics, or anyone who is curious about the work of faculty members.\nWorkload:\nAttend weekly lectures. Write one small paper. Class is P/F\n"
