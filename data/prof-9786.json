            "review_content": "\nI found Professor Nironi to be very difficult to learn from.  He spend the majority of class time proving the formulas and equations that will be used on his problem sets rather than giving examples of how these tools will be used.  I found this immensely frustrating and aside from the first two weeks of class (which were easier and more clearly taught), I learned 100% from the textbook.  This is no exaggeration.  I would sit through class, pay attention, take notes, and grasp only about five minutes of lecture.\nI went to his office hours several times to ask questions and while he was very eager to help, his explanations often continued to go over my head.  I ended up getting most of my help from the Barnard Help room.  (Keep in mind if you decide to do this, only some of the TAs there are familiar with Calc III material so make sure to take note of when they're there.)\nProfessor Nironi also offers a voluntary recitation on Fridays.  I couldn't make it due to a conflicting class, so I can't comment.\nFurthermore, only one problem set out of nine were returned over the semester, making it very difficult to learn from my mistakes.  He also doesn't believe in posting answers to practice exams, so you won't know which concepts you're getting wrong until you get your midterm back (i.e. too late).\nHe writes his midterms to be longer than any student could complete and then grades entirely based on the curve.  This seems intimidating, but actually can work to your advantage because on exams you can entirely avoid one topic that you just couldn't understand and focus more on the things you did understand.\nAlso, no Webassign.\nOn the whole, I would say that Professor Nironi is a fair professor who is ideal for the student who is absolutely in love with proofs and the more esoteric side of math.  If all you're looking for a solid and clear understanding of Calc III, he's probably not the professor for you.\nGrading:\nNine problem sets, worst two dropped. %20\nTwo midterms.  Best one counts for %25, other counts for %15\nOne challenging, but doable final counts for %40\nWorkload:\nOne reasonable problem set per week.  Usually took me 4-6 hours, maybe 8 on the hardest ones.  He drops your lowest two.  He also offers extra credit problems which are significantly more difficult.  Challenging, but manageable.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Nironi is fantastic, Most of the reviews that have been posted here are very misleading and are probably written by dumb students. I did both modern analysis 1 and 2 under Prof. Nironi's guidance and thanks to him i acquired a solid understanding of Real analysis. Any course on mathematical analysis is bound to be rigorous, if you cant handle mathematical rigor, this course is a strict NO, if you like math and if you are passionate about learning math, then this is the most basic course that you need to master. I didnt have any prior background in topology/analysis or any other fancy stuff that has been mentioned in other reviews. Prof. Nironi explains the concepts very well and his notes is excellent. Infact i prefer his notes to the prescribed text(Rudin) just because its more accessible than Rudin for a novice. He is very helpful(There were instances when he went over the entire proof when i had trouble understanding the proof)and his grading too is fair. I do agree that he gives difficult(but thought provoking)mid term exams sometimes and he does it deliberately to gauge the level of the class. He adjusts the difficulty accordingly in subsequent examinations. Over all it was an enjoyable experience learning analysis 1 and 2 from Prof. Nironi. \nP.S. If you cant understand what Prof. Nironi is teaching then you are simply not good enough for studying real analysis , drop the course otherwise you will inevitably screw up and post another misleading review here !\nWorkload:\n1 homework a week\n"

            "review_content": "\nI agree with both of the previous reviews. Fabio Nironi has no idea how to teach a class.  After observing other analysis classes, there is a clear difference between the teaching those professors gave and that of Nironi. They helped, he recited.  De Silva was amazing, Nironi was terrible.  Take it with her or whoever else.  The last review talked about how Nironi made the midterms 20% and 30% and the final 50%, and I agree it's unjust.  Yeah maybe people cheated, but that's the real world and Nironi, after all that schooling, should learn to deal with it.  That's why the homework is only 20%, if people didn't cheat the homework would be 100% rather than putting 80% of the grade on random sit-ins prone to error.  \nThat's not to say cheating is a good thing. I'm sure the class would have loved to have done the problem sets, but you see other professors assign 4-5, maybe 6 problems a week from Rudin. And those problem sets take forever.  Nironi assigns 10, and they're mostly the most obnoxious problems Rudin provides.  The class almost felt like this guys revenge on people who didn't appreciate math like he did.  I mean the proof of Rolle's theorem, probably one of the easiest questions on the exam, still takes a fair amount of ingenuity to pull out of thin air.  He has no idea how to write a test because the problems he assigns for homework can take 3 hours to hammer out in your head, and the questions on the exam were harder than those on the homework. \nIt's not like he went out of his way to help anyone. He didn't host review sessions, answer questions well, post any notes after like the second week, collect the problem sets (we had to drop them in his drop box on our own time), or even tell us when he assigned homework or when it was due.  His method was simple,  Assign the first three questions from the last chapter and the last 7 (very annoying ones) from the previous chapter.  He did squat for this class.  Office hours were pointless or absent, and you'd never see your problem sets even if you attended because he tended to lose them in his train wreck of an office.  The only point where I disagree with the previous reviews is where they claim he cares or is even a good person.  He's lazy (he desperately ran through half the material when he realized he was far behind) but he wants to be brutal out of some misguided idea this will make us all love and be better at math.  His worthless presentations and claims of A+'s are just excuses for his apathy. I'm dead serious, stay away. No matter how well you'd do with him, you'd do better with someone else teaching.\nWorkload:\nAn unreasonable amount:  9 homeworks of 10 problems each. some required topology textbooks, others were just painfully long.  One was 11 pages for me.  The exams literally require that you've seen and remembered the proofs elsewhere, they don't test your knowledge of a process taught by him but of a process either taught in topology or something completely unrelated to analysis (what was his stuff on commutative maps?) or your memory of a proof from some topology book or a half a page long proof in rudin.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nI agree with the previous post. To sum it up, I think Nironi's teaching style punishes, rather than encourages, students who are learning the subject for the first time; for example, from personal experience, he doesn't give much partial credit on exams, if it all.\nFinally, at the last second (way after finals), he decides to completely disregard the homework portion of the grade (20% of the final grade), saying that most students copied from online sources (which I assume is b/c while most students did relatively well on the homeworks, only a handful did well on the exams). I don't agree with this in three aspects: 1) homework problems are much easier than the ones on the exams b/c they're open book and there's no time constraint 2) even if students did find solutions online, it's not that much different than looking up solutions in the student manuals, which is available for many math classes 3) while some may have cheated, some may have actually gotten help from other students or tutors. To drop 20% of the final grade and make the final exam worth 50% after the exam had already been taken, I think it's unfair.\nNironi is a likable professor but his teaching style discourages students who are learning the subject for the first time. The material as difficult as it is, on top of that, with no homework grade and no partial credits on exams and an exam format that favors students who have a strong background in the subject (exams are structured in a way that there are more questions than you have time to answer, which naturally favors students that are familiar with the subject from the start), his teaching method is extremely unforgiving for newcomers. I'd recommend taking this class with some other professor.\nWorkload:\nfinal workload completely different from the original one in the syllabus (not sure if he's allowed to change it?) but it's 50% final, 20% 2 mid terms (25% best 15% worst)\n"

            "review_content": "\nUnfortunately previous reviews for Nironi also hold in proof-based classes. I'd like to say he's very dedicated to the subject and looks to share that inspiration, but I feel there are some problems with that.  First of all he quit posting homework solutions after the fourth problem set, and when people requested more solutions he emailed the class and told us to Google them.  In fact, he didn't even hand back our homework, you had to be lucky enough to find him in his office.  \nSecond  his office hours were a real pain, immediately after the class at a time where almost anyone would have another class to attend, and he wasn't particularly personable when he was available. of all he pretty much just lectures straight from the textbook, it even sounds as if he's reading to you.  Some people find it a virtue when a professor follows the textbook closely, but that wasn't really the case.  Rudin's exposition is so much better than most people didn't really take any notes or pay much attention at all to his lectures, which are particularly hard to follow anyways.   \nThird, he mostly, with some notable exceptions, just lectures straight from the textbook, it even sounds as if he's reading to you.  Some people find it a virtue when a professor follows the textbook closely, but that wasn't really the case.  Rudin's exposition is so much better than most people didn't really take any notes or pay much attention at all to his lectures, which are particularly hard to follow anyways.  As for those exceptions, he adds in a ton of topology, far past what Rudin found necessary.  Some of the definitions in Rudin are esoteric but that's because they make the material more fluid.\nFinally, while on the note of topology, quite frankly if you haven't taken topology and algebra don't take analysis with Nironi.  He really presumes you know a lot of mathematics beforehand even if he claims this is where everyone should start in college.  I was in topology for about half the semester and I could clearly see that the handful of us had a clear advantage over those who didn't know what all his additional topology was going on about.  This was particularly obnoxious on the first midterm and to some extent the second midterm where half the material was literally topology, which is fine only as far as the second chapter is concerned, not when he expects you to pull the product/box/discrete topology out of some spark of innovation and work with it.\nOther notes, his exams were pretty much a free for all, especially the first one wherein he just put a ton of questions without even knowing how many points there were total and told us to run with it. I guess that's fine if you want to do a ton of stuff on an exam, but he wound up curving the average, a 48 or so out of 200 something to a C.  There was a clear distribution based on previous background.   Second midterm was alright, and the final was a pain. \nI guess he also realized at the second to- or last week of the semester that he was pretty far behind, so he pretty much crammed differentiation and integration into a week or two and made a problem set due Monday (we were a Tuesday Thursday class) without any announcement (I was particularly unhappy about this since I turned it in unknowingly on Tuesday and have yet to get a grade for it) and then he jammed both the integration and differentiation into a problem set due on study week.  \nHe tries to be generous with presentations and extra credit. I did a presentation, its 5 points and given his curves Im not quite sure how valuable that was, if those points are even for tests.   The extra credit assignment I handed in twice and he never noticed I guess, I'd have given it to him at office hours but, you know...\nLet's put it this way: If you have a lot of math background, you'll kill in this class.  If not, stay out. Either way, you'll probably enjoy it a lot better with Savin, De Silva, Masdeu, whoever else is teaching, and you'll have a reason to come to class.  I really think he's a nice guy and he probably means well, he just needs to figure out what he's doing.  Maybe disregard this review when it turns brown/green with the \"5 years ago\" statement, he needs to grow has a teacher.\n\nWorkload:\n20% 9 problem sets with breaks given randomly but he says he'll disregard them if you do really well on tests, 2 midterms (25% your better `15% your worse), final 40%.\nHe assigns the worst, i,e. 5-part with little benefit in return, problems\n"

I took calc 2 simultaneously  with calc 3, and I did significantly better in calc 2 because that professor took the time and effort to explain concepts in different ways that suited my way of thinking. I'm not saying that my ability to learn solely depends on the teacher's ability to teach - the student also needs to show initiative and willingness to learn (which I do - I'm not throwing $60,000 a year to not learn). But there's need to be a balance; efforts need to be made on both sides in the right way. Nironi doesn't make that effort, either because he doesn't want to or doesn't know how to.

He is a very smart guy and approachable, but he doesn't understand how to communicate with students, particularly students learning a subject for the first time. I went to his office hours for the first half of the semester, but I always walked out even more confused. Recitations weren't that helpful either. homeworks are useless for studying for exams (he said that himself). exams aren't meant to be finished (he said that too). he doesn't give solutions to past exams, so I struggled a lot when I tried practicing on my own and with classmates too.\nOther students may say that Nironi actually makes you learn real math rather than regurgitate theorems and formulas. But I disagree. I felt that Nironi could have done a better job of laying down the basics before throwing us into the deep end. I've never felt so discouraged about a class before. \nPlease take this as a fair warning - if you want to keep your sanity and have a decent GPA, don't take Nironi's classes (at least the basic level ones). \nWorkload:\nweekly problem sets; 2 midterms; 1 final\n"

I took Calc II and Calc III with him.  He will put in many extra hours to help his students; he holds an optional recitation to do homework problems and frequently meets with students in his office.  That said, while he works extra hours, so will you.  My classmates and I spent a great deal more time working for his class than our friends in other sections.  I really recommend finding a study group within his class, that was super helpful for me.  \nDo not take Fabio's class if you are easily frustrated, entirely uninterested in math, or just want an easy A.  I felt that grading was very fair, but the averages were brutally low, so much so that your raw score was basically meaningless.  I got an A both semesters, but I worked really hard and enjoyed a lot of the math.  \nAs a person, Fabio is a wonderful, kind, eccentric, brilliant-professor type.  I sincerely appreciated how he would be knitting an enormous fuzzy sweater during our midterms and some of his better comebacks when people asked annoying questions.  He also never intentionally made me feel stupid (and I asked a fair amount of questions).  He would never think of sending a student to a TA without helping him/her first.  He didn't even trust the TA's (with good reason) to grade our finals.  \nI'm really glad that I took Fabio's class, but it certainly wasn't easy.  Best of luck!\nWorkload:\nA problem set (usually pretty long) every week.  Two very hard midterms, but with a fair curve.
