They don't provide homework, or the homework they do provide is impossible. Professor Nicolau is a rare exception. Although she has a moderate Greek accent it never prevents her from getting her point across. She truly loves Statistics and works hard to make her students appreciate it as well. I am so happy I took her class.\nWorkload:\nA few problemsets during the week with answers given in the back of the book,\none midterm, (easy with review),\none moderately difficult final.\n"
