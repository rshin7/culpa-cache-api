Exams are quite challenging, grading is pretty unreasonable, and he reads from slides so you can skip lecture, which I consider to be a terrible use of $4,000 and 10 weeks of one's life.  Full disclosure, I'm in GS with all A's in econ. I got a B+ in the end but nearly 100 on all the problem sets and worked my tail off for the exams.  No idea how you get an A but I have never consistently fallen asleep in a class at Columbia before this so aside from being surprised by the grade in the aftermath, I was fairly disappointed with the whole experience. It was a large lecture class but the attention from the TA's was lackluster and certainly didn't make up for the subpar leadership.\nWorkload:\nFour written problem sets, insane midterm and final. No recitations (except to review the problem sets after you hand them in and useless 'exam review sessions').\n"
