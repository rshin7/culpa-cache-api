She truly wants all of her students to do well and you will get an A if you show up and put in the effort. She makes even the most difficult material comprehensive and she always makes time to meet with her students directly after class in her office if needed. She always shows up to class in a good mood, despite it being really early in the morning and she makes every single class enjoyable. Her class was one that I always looked forward to waking up to because I knew it would be lighthearted and I also knew that I would learn a lot in an engaging way. I couldn't have asked for a greater teacher or experience. TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!! I guarantee that there is not one person who doesn't love this woman. \nWorkload:\nLight, totally manageable. About four quizzes/semester, a midterm and a final and two compositions. \n"
