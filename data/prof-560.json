I would recommend Elizabeth Blackmar's History of the American Landscape over this course, even if you are more of an architectural history person. I found Prof. Wright's classes to be more about spouting political opinion, with or without any facts to back these opinions up, than about allowing students to draw their conclusions on their own terms.\nWorkload:\nFairly light...one final paper, no final. But I wouldn't take this as an extra class if you are hoping to get someting out of just going to lecture.\n"
