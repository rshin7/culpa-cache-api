            "review_content": "\nIf you're interested, at ALL, in astronomy or astrophysics - Frits is your man.\nProfessor Paerels brought everything in this class down to a very, very, very digestible level. At times, it seemed like a lot of his lectures were oversimplified (and sometimes this was true), but at the end of the day he made sure everyone had a functional knowledge of the astrophysical topics at hand. And if you had any astronomy related question - it didn't have to be related to the coursework - he was always ready to talk it out. Sometimes, half a lecture would just go by in question-and-answer sessions with Frits. That got annoying at times, but it's also a testament to how well he can take high-level astro concepts and bring them down to a first-year undergraduate level.\nAs for this class specifically, it was pretty easy. The problem sets are designed to walk you through each step with very minimal math required between each part - it was a little simplistic at times, but hey, it definitely made sure everyone was working towards the right thing. Additionally, he really emphasized understanding the physical meaning of results we obtained by calculation - \"what does this number mean in the real world?\" We had a midterm and final. The midterm was in-class and was open-everything (as such, it was slightly more difficult than the PSets or the final; this was the only graded portion of the class in which I lost points). The final was take home and basically just another PSet. This was a pretty fun class and I'd definitely take another class with Frits if I had the chance.\nWorkload:\n5 PSets, approximately every other week, pretty easy. In-class midterm, slightly more difficult, but open-book, open-computer, etc. Take-home final, basically another pset. Not too bad.\n"

            "review_content": "\nFritz is probably one of the best professors anyone potentially interested in astronomy/astrophysics/physics can meet.\nThe class would often be about answering our questions about the universe whether related to the current material or not (make sure to ask him about the expansion of the universe to see the face he makes,) and felt more like a professional level class then any other intro class I have ever taken.\nThe hw's guide you through themselves and are fairly easy, yet you actually get to figure out mathematically amazing processes and relations about stars. These derivations only exist in old papers and so it is hard/impossible to look them up, but the question asks you step by step what to do.\nThe midterm was take home and more like a slightly more challenging pset then a midterm. We figured out the approximately how close protons get to each other in the core of mainsequence stars through some simplifying assumptions.\nThough the class does require knowledge of basic calculus, and is definitely not for those who are not interested in science.\n\nWorkload:\na pset every other week, problems are asked step by step so the questions guide you through to the answer.\ntake home midterm\nA slightly challenging take home final just like the psets and midterm.\n"

Yes, it's a ton of math that seems insanely overwhelming to those of us who can barely multiply, but Frits is *so* nice and *so* helpful, that you'll never worry about asking for help. More importantly, his midterm and final are completely open note, meaning that as long as you organize your notes and problem sets before the exam, you're likely to find the answers to the questions right in your notebook. No need to spend hours studying the night before! Seriously...take this class. You'll reduce your stress level, and you'll actually learn something! \nWorkload:\nNot bad. 4-5 problem sets, with about a week to complete each one. One midterm, one final. Problem sets took me about an hour to complete (looking things up online helped a LOT), and I barely studied for the exams, and I ended up with a B+. \n"

He's easy going and approachable and not a stuck up asshole like some other professors are across both schools. He views his students as people far more then some other professors. I felt like I was respected and my lack of math knowledged and struggling was taken into consideration. He is a wonderful person and its been a pleasure having him as a professor! \nPlease be advised if you are not good in MATH do NOT take this class. Despite how easy it may seem the concepts involve math that can be challenging. \nWorkload:\n3-4 problem sets, midterm, and a final \n"

            "review_content": "\nFrits Paerels led a really easy and relaxed Frontiers of Science discussion section.  Yes, most people will find this class incredibly boring but I personally didn't find it that bad.  After all, discussion is only once a week and if you pay attention during lecture you will learn something no matter how good you already are at science.  Anyway, Frits is an extremely kind, helpful man who assigned little homework and was extremely generous with grading.  However, his discussion section is not particularly informative and I never really felt that the lectures were significantly clearer after going through discussion (this may be because the lectures are already quite clear).\nWorkload:\nI don't remember exactly how many but only around 7 weekly individual assignments were given throughout the whole semester and these were quite easy/took little time.  There was also a small amount of reading which was not something to be stressed over.  All the work is graded quite easily but I'm not sure if Paerels gives A+ so even if you're expecting that grade, don't count on it.\n"

You should get an A without working too hard if you have a basic knowledge of physics. There is no curve on the tests but they are easy and entirely open everything: notebook, textbook, even computer! He drops one of the five problem sets, but if you go to him or any of the TAs for help they will practically do the problems for you. Definitely take this class to get out of a science requirement.
