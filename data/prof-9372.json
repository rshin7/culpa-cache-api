She may be a Harvard-trained economist, but she teaches you nothing you can't find in a textbook for thirty bucks. I came to this school for knowledgeable professors who do ground-breaking work, and reading from her notes word for word out of the textbook does not, I am sorry to say, qualify as groundbreaking. If you want to waste your incredibly high tuition listening to this woman, be my guest, but if you came here to actually learn something, look elsewhere. \nWorkload:\nDecent: 5 problem sets, a midterm and final, and a group presentation (which you get very little direction on). \n"
