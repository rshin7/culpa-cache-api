I feel she didnt really read up on the assignments and let the pretentious students continue to ramble on and say what they felt or saw on tv.  She tried to be too nice and not step on anyones toes and should have told more students simply that they were wrong.\nWorkload:\nweekly questions and four 2pg responses\n"

She was so helpful, always ready to respond to questions, hear other ppl's points of views, answer emails. And she really helped me better understand the material because some of it was pretty obscure, to me at least. She's great!\n"
