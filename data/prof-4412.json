            "review_content": "\nTownsend is a very nice professor who's very understanding. Since this class is heavily discussion-based, she does her best to facilitate discussions regarding the readings for the week. She doesn't lecture too often, although she will review concepts if necessary.\nIf you have Townsend for this course, Intro to Major Topics in EA Civilizations is a good course to take to satisfy part of the Global Core requirement. \n(my only complaint is that my class was all the way in Knox Hall. Hopefully it won't be for the rest of you guys)\nWorkload:\nReadings - they can be quite heavy at times, and quite light for other weeks. If you can't read the whole thing, at least skim in order to not get lost in discussions.\nDiscussion board - each week, you will be required to post a response to the readings of the week (or, answer one of the discussion questions she provides - it's your choice) on the CourseWorks discussion board. It's only supposed to be about half a page.\nQuizzes - technically \"pop quizzes\" although Townsend pretty much gives away when the quizzes will be. She'll even review the concepts a week before the quiz. The quiz is basically just writing everything you know about three words/concepts she puts on the board.\nPapers - there are two 5-6 page papers. Both of them could be considered \"midterms\" in a sense. The topics are given from the first day, and the prompts are very broad (e.g. compare/contrast doctrines)\nFinal - Not a problem if you've done the readings. It's take-home.\n"
