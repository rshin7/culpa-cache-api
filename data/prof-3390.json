            "review_content": "\nProfessor Rosenbaum has a great teaching style with clear objectives, interesting syllabus and good control of class discussion. Seminars can be hit or miss depending on professor ability to carefully guide discussion without lecturing or over-managing. Professor Rosenbaum was able to do this. She has great experience in anthro and is easy to talk to outside of class. \nWorkload:\nDecent amount of reading for a seminar, weekly responses on Courseworks and ~15 pg paper. If you are interested in the topics, the work is not bad. \n"
