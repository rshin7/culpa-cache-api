He seems nervous and shy the first time he teaches class, and he never loses that demeanor but you eventually learn he has some of the best nerdy humor around.  At first I was afraid he wasn't going to lead a discussion well enough or be commanding enough but not only was he adequate to the job he also made discussion pretty relaxed and fun.\n"
