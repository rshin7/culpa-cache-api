He is also easy to talk to and seems to be a nice guy.  Let me also tell you that I'm not sure what I learned in this class.  In fact I don't think I learned anything in this class, nor, I think, did many other people.  I do however remember that Jones ended every single 75 minute lecture 20 minutes early.    Make of that what you will.\nWorkload:\nAn extreme amount of reading that you are only expected to read parts of.\n"

Even if you are not prepared for class, he makes the dense material understandable and is open to all comments or questions. Class participation is key but he responds well to any question, even if it isn't exactly correct, so its not that hard to participate. He loves making diagrams on the board to show different theories, so if you're a visual learner, then you're in luck. I would strongly recommend him. \nWorkload:\n2 5 page papers, short midterm, final.\n"

He presented the material and directed the discussion in such a way that we came to some deeper understanding of each of the works on our own. We all walked out of every single class with a much greater understanding than we walked in with. By far the best core class. My major has nothing to do with history, but I will definitely be taking his other classes. \nWorkload:\nReading (Standard), 3 papers but he dedicates a lot of time to grading them so its really only 2, midterm (short) and final. \n"

            "review_content": "\nA great course. If you like computers, Prof. Jones' course is a great way to get exposed to their history, which is pretty awesome considering how contemporary all of the material is. The course covers lots of things that you never knew about, but were fundamental in the evolution of computing, which is what a good history course should do.\nFor what you pay, you should expect that the professors be brilliant, and Prof. Jones absolutely is. He switches seamlessly between software, economics, psychology, etc. He often understands what you are trying to say better than you do, and when he repeats it, you are left wishing that you could think as clearly as he speaks.\nA few caveats:\n- It is the summer, but the Prof. still wanted 200 pages of reading for each class, which can be intense from Monday to Wednesday, especially since readings are often only released after class. \n- It's a seminar, so be prepared to speak up. Also, be prepared to listen to other people, who may or may not have something intelligent to say. \n- Lastly, likely also because of the summer, Prof. Jones was not always readily available by email, so if you have something urgent, go find him.\nWorkload:\nApprox. 200 pages of reading PER CLASS, one online posting per class, final paper (10-12 pages) on a computer topic of your choice.\n"

I will, however, highlight just one of his many admirable qualities, and allow it to stand as advice to any lucky enough to have this brilliant man for CC: Matthew Jones, far more than the dunce who taught you University Writing, will teach you to write well if that is the only thing he does for you all semester long. He took a month to grade twenty papers just so that he could comment on each and every syntactic and semantic point with which any could take issue. And his point is not pedantry: scholarly writing can furnish one with habits most pernicious to good style, so Professor Jones takes it as a personal burden to help each student rid her writing of dull imagery and obese phrases\u00e2\u20ac\u201dverbiage of every kind and colour. And\u00e2\u20ac\u201dneedless to say, perhaps\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhe leaves no grammatical flaw untouched.\nA word of advice, then: edit your essays with an unsparing pen. Cut out every impersonal phrase, every instance of the passive voice, every awkward phrase, every bit of language you don't absolutely need. You'll do yourself a favour. Even if you don't, however, Professor Jones will help. He's kind that way.\nWorkload:\nTwo five-page essays, midterm, final exam.\n"

Since our class was on MW during the Fall semester which means we have an extra class day than the other TW classes, he gave us a day off! I don't think you can find a better CC, a better core professor. \nWorkload:\n3 Papers (5 pages each but he felt that it was too much and actually only gave us 2 PAPERS); Midterm & Final; Typical CC reading but we actually cut down on 3 texts so we have more time to discuss the texts that we, the students, deem more important. \n"

There is no doubt that this man is brilliant, yet his personality is such that he makes even the least intelligent student feel comfortable.  He formed an interesting and provocative analysis of the works we read while always dedicating a significant portion of the classtime to student-based discussions.  His papers were the first at Columbia that I considered fun, and he never tested us over things that were not lengthily considered during class.  In short, Professor Jones is GREAT, and one should feel extremely lucky to have him as a professor.\nWorkload:\n3 papers, midterm, final... nothing too bad.\n"

His lectures were always 50 minutes long, and included a wealth of good natured and EXTREMELY coherent and organized information. He's got a great dorky but intelligent sense of humor and is great at making the material engaging. And despite his brilliance, he takes a sincere interest in his students and their opinions. Jones is by far the best prof I've had at CU yet and I HIGHLY recommend him. In fact I think CULPA should upgrade him to gold nugget....\nWorkload:\nHeavy reading, two 5-7 page papers, two exams. The material and reading can be difficult, but Jones and the TAs can help you through them. Exams are straightforward and stick to thematic questions, no tricks.\n"

It must suck being one of his TA's however, for sections were tedious and uninspiring in comparison to Jones' lectures.   Unfortunately, Professor Jones may be too \"spirited \" for Columbia's History department.  That's too bad because people like him are why we pay the 'big bucks\" to attend Ivys. No other Professor from his generation at Columbia can hold a candle to him.  But it's more important to have specialists in the 19th-century women's labor movement than classically trained professors, right?\nWorkload:\n2 Papers, some very tedious readings, but very fair midterm and final.\n"

While he is no doubt extremely intelligent, and I have certainly heard good accounts from all his History dept. students, in CC I feel that he reigned in the class far too infrequently, letting the discussion get either far afield or, worse, inaccurate.  If you don't go in for shooting-from-the-hip philosophy, I would be wary of this CC section (on the other hand, I took this class two years ago, so things might have changed).\n"

Miss Showboat of the Film department could learn something from him.) You get the impression that Matthew Jones could read Butler Library in a fortnight, and then deliver it in the most incisively comprehensive lecture in one (maybe two) semester. Jones is also a nice guy and not full of himself, which is another rarity. I don't think he'll change, either. The downside are the bumbling confused thickbrained TAs who can't keep up with the course. Sitting through their section groups is like witnessing one of those incoherent creatures that shuffle through the subway and mutter endlessly in the twilight zone. \nWorkload:\nWorkload is normal to above average with two papers, and arguably a lot of reading - - depending upon the student, but you're graded by these dimwitted grad students, who after Jone's brilliant lectures shouldn't be allowed the privilege. Send them to the copy room where they can sharpen their skills for future employment.\n"

He doesn't have a magic touch or something. But he is a really cool guy. He knows a lot about basically anything, and everything he says is something I always note as completely non obvious, so it's always fun to hear what he has to say. I have to say, though, that he isn't the best at promoting discussions. I mean, it's nice to have a retarded argument every once in a while in CC. And whenever we start getting into a heated debate over something, he pretty much stops it and asks a really obscure question. Usually I'll just think \"damnit,\" after he does that. His intentions are good, of course, he's just too smart for us. But he is an awesome lecturer, which i sort of wish he would do more. I think it'd definitely be worth it to take at least one of his lecture courses.\nWorkload:\n2 or 3 papers (hey if you think papers are fun than that is your opinion), midterm, cumulative final \n"

A quick resume: he graduated from Harvard in three years, having studied philosophy, mathematics, and history; he read History of Science at Cambridge in England; he went back to Harvard and got his Ph.D. in intellectual thought and the history of science. He knows two dialects of Ancient Greek, Latin, German, French, and, if I'm not mistaken, Italian. Columbia rushed him through his dissertation to bring him here and put him on the fast-track to tenure. As if those weren't qualification enough to teach here, he's a really sweet guy, friendly and approachable. He's happy to shoot the shit during office hours, and he's an easy grader, provided you know the material. Note that it is NOT hard to glean insight into the material he's teaching because he's a fantastic teacher, lecturer, and leader of discussion. Jones doesn't let discussion veer off course, and (!) he's tolerant of even the most absurd of comments or opinions. The only fault I discern is that he's too new to have built enough confidence. He'll always stop in the middle of sentence if someone hand goes up, but at least he cares about fostering discussion.\nWorkload:\nFor CC: an easy midterm, three easy and fun 5 page papers, and a final.\n"
