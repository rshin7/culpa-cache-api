            "review_content": "\nIt's pretty obvious I guess that classes will be more interesting if you do the work and are willing to pursue the subject a bit. On that view of things, I probably didn't do Giuseppe justice, and especially after reading his other reviews, I'm a little hesitant to pin my experience of his class solely on him.\nBut I really hated the class. I listened (mostly), I did the readings (sometimes after the classes, I'll admit), and I got solid grades. Despite all that, I just couldn't get into it. There were glimmers of something interesting which poked through occasionally (like when he talked about Greek musical philosophy), but we mostly moved excruciatingly slowly and focused on fairly banal structural points. It felt like we were learning obscure historical terms by rote rather than actually engaging with the ideas. My fault, perhaps, but it seems fair to say: it was unbearably god-damn boring.\nThat said, Guiseppe is one of the nicest people I've had the good fortune to spend time with. He's flexible, friendly, thoughtful\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgreat all around. \nWorkload:\nthree quizzes\nreadings, listenings\nmidterm, final\ntwo papers (1000 words)\n"

            "review_content": "\nGiuseppe is just a really great guy. The class is quite straightforward, but there are occasional moments that are just straight-up fun. I also have to give him a great deal of credit for learning the name of everyone in a 35 person LECTURE. The very beginning of the class was kind of slow due to the material, Ancient Greek perceptions of music; the problem is that only a few fragments of Greek music survive, so the majority of this section was devoted to Plato's writings on the subject, plus a few more ancients. We then moved on to the medieval period, which is more my style than most students, so in my opinion this material plus the Renaissance could have easily occupied a full semester. In the middle of this, we took a slight detour forward to Monteverdi, as the department brought the stellar Baroque ensemble Tenet to St. Paul's Chapel to be the subject for our class's concert reports. We jumped back and forth once or twice because of this, ending with Bach.\nThe material is presented in a straightforward manner, more or less like Music Hum, but with some time devoted to looking at scores and discussing smaller details.\nBut anyway, Giuseppe is just awesome.\nWorkload:\n2 easy multiple choice quizzes\nConcert report (~1500 words), concert was provided for our class\nMidterm: 3 listening IDs, 3 scores for which you had to ID and write roughly a page about the main features, 2 out of 4 essay questions on fairly broad subjects (i.e. they test what you know, not what you don't know)\nFinal: First two sections identical to the midterm, a handful of easy multiple choice questions instead of essays.\nFor the final and the midterm ID questions, we were responsible for about 20 pieces each. The final only covered material after the midterm.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI still don't quite understand how Gerbino managed to make this subject interesting, but he did. I never found myself bored in class, even during the discussion of plainchant. Maybe it's his awesome Italian accent, but I think it's largely because he's just a good lecturer. I stopped doing the reading about halfway through the class and still came out with an excellent grade. Take really good notes and only study what he tells you to study and you will be fine. The reading is very interesting, however, and is worth your time if you have it.\nWorkload:\nMidterm, final, book report (all you have to do is summarize the main points of the book). Reading and listening.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Gerbino is WONDERFUL and the class is very, very interesting. Get ready for a crash course in counterpoint if you are a music theory novice (as I was, but I picked it up really quickly thanks to \"real life\" examples)... however, as this is an upper-level elective, it is not a class for a non-music major (or for those without extensive musical background -- it is necessary for the level of analysis that is done).\nThe syllabus is packed with beautiful music and some interesting reading (some more dense than others, obviously). Prof. Gerbino is so passionate about Bach that it is almost impossible not to love it as much as he does. He is very concerned that his students are learning and understanding the material and is very eager to answer/leave time for questions in class. Overall, this was a wonderful experience; I learned so much and had a great professor. I would highly recommend this course, and I personally look forward to hopefully taking another class with Prof. Gerbino before I graduate.\nWorkload:\n2 essays (about 10 pgs. in length); midterm and a non-cumulative final, both of which are fairly easy thanks to his thorough explantion of the material that needs to be studied.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Gerbino's class is more about opera as theater than on the musical specifics of opera.  I would have liked to see more of a focus on the music and less studying of plot summaries and memorization of characters.  The readings are heavy, but if you do the minimum, exams won't be too hard.  There are a lot of operas to cover, too many infact.  That's my main complaint.  You can't really analyze an opera with any depth when you spend two classes on it and one class focuses totally on plot summary.  If you like opera though, you'll like this class.  \nWorkload:\nFair.  Two 3-5 page essays, midterm exam, final exam.  Fairly easy grader.\n"

I'd take another class with him (if the music department were *ahem!* making any electives available ... ) \nWorkload:\nA couple of short papers that are graded lightly.

            "review_content": "\nAbsolutely awesome professor, my best class of the semester. If Santa Claus were young, Italian, and kept his beard neatly trimmed, he would greatly resemble Giuseppe Gerbino. Gerbino's jolly, energetic teaching and love for the music enlivened what could have been a terrifically boring 9 am class. He really cares about his students, too, and he's great to chat with during office hours. Best of all, unlike some of the other classes in the history sequence (ahem... BOYNTON), Gerbino puts all the music in a social framework instead of just blandly wading through a laundry list of pieces, making every lecture interesting and enlightening. Sure, the histories can be a little dry in terms of actual course content, but Gerbino makes them more than bearable. I'll definitely try to take an elective with him next year.\nOh, and he has by far the coolest accent of anyone I've ever met.\nProf. Gerbino is a rising star in a department filled with excellent teachers. Two thumbs up.\nWorkload:\nLight reading, two easy analysis assignments, straightforward midterm and final. The midterm was graded ruthlessly, but as a result, people had a far better idea of what he was looking for, and improvement was justly rewarded. This was especially useful for those coming from Boynton who had grown accustomed to her \"write anything and get an A\" exams. Not quite an easy A, but a very attainable A.\n"

He's a very nice guy, is extremely knowledgeable (mostly about Romantic music, though he knows his earlier music history too), is very approachable outside of class, and has an awesome Italian accent. He's also very understanding of students' perspectives on grading, thankfully. He'll often ask for student input when it comes to paper topics, due dates and grading. Gerbino puts a lot of emphasis on Bach and the Romantic periods, with some of the other topics seeming a bit rushed. In all, though, you'll learn a lot in this class and probably get a pretty good grade, too, if you put in a bit of an effort.\nWorkload:\n(Very) occasional reading and listening assignments, two semi-long papers, one concert review (it had to be La Boheme for us), midterm and final (not cakewalks but pretty manageable).\n"
