The problem sets are extremely long, and she is a strict grader when it comes to the exams. This is relatively fair though, as all her exam questions are straightforward.\nWorkload:\nLong problem sets due every 2 weeks. Quizzes, midterm, final. The quizzes are scheduled. An additional cheat sheet allowed for each quiz or exam, so by the end you are allowed 5 sheets (and you will need all of them for the material).\n"
