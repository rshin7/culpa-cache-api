            "review_content": "\nIllan is enthusiastic, intelligent, smart, funny, and patient. He teaches 1st and 2nd Year Hebrews I and II.\nHe's laid back, which allows the students to develop camaraderie with him and each other. He has a huge bank of knowledge about Semitic languages and linguistics in general, and he incorporates his knowledge into lessons. He is always good-natured and willing to meet with students outside of class. \nHe wants nothing more than for his students to succeed, and it shows. He prioritizes the needs of the class before any others, and still manages to teach material thoroughly. He seems to truly love to teach, which makes his class all the more enjoyable. He wants to share his knowledge, and he wants his students to appreciate it and to love learning it.\nI could not recommend Illan more.\nWorkload:\nAbout an hour of homework per night; six quizzes per semester; final exam. The quizzes are manageable and Illan gives a review packet before each quiz. \n"
