            "review_content": "\nThis is a frustrating class.\nThe lectures are worthless, unless you're a fan of the absurd. Graham rambles on and on about stats and goes off on compounding tangents until no one knows what got them there. You're better off just following the great textbook. I tried very hard to follow the lectures for the first half of the semester, but ended up just doing problems and reading the text to prepare for exams.\nThe labs are easy and don't really teach you anything beyond a few basic commands in STATA. \nGrades seem arbitrary. She and the TAs are quite cagey about how grades were determined and whether or not a curve was in effect. You got a lot of \"the mean score on the exam was ___\", but not a lot of explanation about how your grade would be tabulated. Oh and you have to give the exams back once you see your grade. WTF?\nAll that being said, Norma herself is the sweetest, most supportive professor you could ask for. Just go to her office hours and you will be treated to sage advice and someone who genuinely cares about your story. She takes note, FFS.\nShe would be a great psych adviser, but holy hell, keep her away from this intro stats class\nWorkload:\nNo real homework. Labs are easily completed in the allotted lab time. 3 midterms are easy if you follow the book. Final was as if she had pulled it from another year: lots of terms and perspectives we had not covered...puzzling.\n"

            "review_content": "\nMy overall experience of the class: not bad, somewhat enjoyable. \nAs far as professors go, there is a lot to be said about Professor Graham. Her teaching is quite often very confusing, though, if I'd paid closer attention to her lectures, I'm sure I would have gleaned a lot more information for the multiple choice part of the tests. Not only does she put up very complicated diagrams and difficult theories about the material that you're learning, but also her handwriting is absolutely atrocious and difficult to read...so I often just gave up on paying attention to the lecture. I personally found that she got very absorbed by a single example and would attempt to explain it, spending too little time teaching the simple concepts and the mechanics behind certain statistical tests (which, I felt, would generally be much more helpful for the tests). \nAs a person, however, Professor Graham is absolutely wonderful. She is sweet, understanding, patient, and always has the best interests of her students in her mind. She and her TAs (James and Travis) are always offering office hours and review sessions for students who may have difficulties with anything in the class, as well as being open ears for students' questions about absolutely anything about psychology or graduate school. Because of these aspects of her personality, statistics with Professor Graham was much more pleasant than I anticipated. \nAlso, the TAs James and Travis are awesome! They were very helpful and were always very willing to help students out. \nMy advice:\nHaving taken AP Statistics in the past, I was essentially relying on my past knowledge at all times to carry my weight in the course and using the textbook for the class to refresh the information I had once learned. In any case, the textbook for the class is really, really good (Bock, Velleman, and DeVeaux). Also, for people have little to none statistics experience, I would recommend really learning the foundational aspects of stats, because after a certain point, you're just learning different tests which essentially follow the same mechanical format with a few adjustments to the statements of the conclusions. \nWorkload:\nShe recently revamped the class, so the exams are somewhat more manageable within time constraints. \n3 exams, 1 final (Allowed a cheat sheet of varying lengths throughout the course to help you!)\n+ Pop quizzes to ensure class attendance (very little portion of your grade)\n+ 10 Stata labs\nDepending on your past statistics ability, I think that the amount of time you invest in the class could vary. The problem sets she assigns are not mandatory, but they definitely help prepare you for the exams. The exams are somewhat strenuous, particularly because most people are in the classroom racing to finish the long exams. The exams consist of a multiple choice section which is primarily about the (difficult) statistical theory that I think she probably covered in class when I wasn't paying much attention, and the other section is primarily statistical calculations (which is where I got most of my points). Since the exams are pretty long, there wasn't much chance to check my calculations, but silly calculation errors really don't hurt you that much in the long run if you can demonstrate that you actually know how to perform the test. My final was 19 pages, one of which was extra credit... a pretty long final...\nIn my opinion, the Stata labs were easy points. I don't know why all the reviewers here seem so angry and perplexed by these labs. I personally didn't find them to be very difficult, and, for the most part, they could be completed within the 50 minutes during your lab section. If you didn't finish (which I often didn't because I'm somewhat of a perfectionist), there is Stata on the computers in Butler and Lerner, and you can stop in to the TA's office hours for help if you're still confused by the assignments. \n\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis course has evolved significantly since most of the reviews below. Professor Graham has taken the complaints about her class into account and revised it so that most of the major issues no longer apply. For instance, there are no more marathon exams or labs. In fact, the first exam was so short and easy that most of the class ended up getting near perfect/perfect scores (she made the later ones longer, but they were still manageable). And there hasn't been a single lab that I wasn't able to complete within the two-hour lab period.\nThat said, be prepared: Professor Graham is still pretty disorganized with her lectures, and you should expect to teach yourself a lot of the material. She clearly knows her stuff, maybe even too well, so she doesn't really spend a lot of time going over the basics. Which means if you want to do well, you'll need to read the textbook before each lecture. The upside is that if you do have a handle on the material, Graham's lectures actually add a decent amount of value and insight on top of that. If you don't read the textbook, you will have no bloody idea what she's talking about, but that's how it goes.\nAnyone who is worried about this class should be reassured by the extremely generous curve of 40% As, 50% Bs, and 10% Cs. If you do even slightly better than the median score, you'll end up with an A. And if you end up screwing up at some point, go talk to her and figure something out, she is an extremely nice old lady who actually really cares about her students. Our TAs, James and Travis, were also awesome, but apparently they will no longer be TAing next semester so new students are gonna have to roll the dice on that one.\nWorkload:\nLow-Moderate for a 4-credit class, the textbook chapters are pretty short. The amount of work you'll have to put into this class will probably depend on how naturally good at math you are. If you suck at math, expect to spend ALOT more time on it.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI waited a couple of months to write this review in hopes that the \"end of semester emotional roller coaster\" would cease and allow me to write about Professor Graham from a better place. Yeah...it's been almost four months and I still pissed that I wasted thousands of dollars on this class. I have never had such a miserable and wasteful class experience in my life! I am sure Professor Graham performs brilliant research, and she seems like a very nice lady. That said, she should stay far, far away from the classroom, as she is a horrible teacher.\nShe begins the course by telling you that, if you're not good in math, you will do poorly in the class. Pretty strange for a psychologist, right? Isn't the whole point of being in college to learn? C'mon. Earn your money...TEACH! Her lectures are downright incoherent, handouts and handwriting are illegible, and the exams were so long that they were impossible to finish. I'm not exaggerating, an hour after the midterm (right about the time I was in a bar drinking away my misery over my utter and complete shock at the difficulty and length of the exam) the class received a mass email from Prof. Graham APOLOGIZING for midterm's length and difficulty. Really? You're a brilliant statistician and you can't figure out how to create a moderately difficult exam that takes an hour and a half to complete? Really?\nThe labs are ridiculously long and tedious, and the TAs offer very little guidance and help. You will NEVER finish within the two hour lab, and it will take you hours upon hours to finish them on your own. I recommend buying the STATA program for an extra $60 so you have the option of doing it at home, since students had a really hard time finding available computers on campus with the up to date STATA. \nI took this course because I am very serious about pursuing a career in clinical psychology, and I am extremely distressed by the fact that I got a B in the course and haven't the foggiest idea about statistics!\nOh, and if you're reading this, Professor: STOP USING YOUR F*CKING iPAD!!!!\nWorkload:\nA couple of hours worth of practice problems per week to week and a half. Not terrible, except for the fact that you're learning everything from the text. Attendance to lectures is optional, but could positively impact your grade if you're borderline. I'm not sure if that's true, but I went to all but two lectures. Everyone that actually attends usually just zoned out or did other work, though, because her lectures are so confusing that you're better off not listening. The labs are mandatory and are going to take you hours and hours to complete. Majorly long midterm and the final exam will make you want to cry and jump off the roof of your dorm building.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAvoid Professor Graham's class. Go to her for questions about the department, the university, Psych research, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust don't take her class.\nAs most of the reviews for her Science of Psych class explain, Professor Graham is a sweet, considerate woman who cares about her students. Unfortunately, she is disorganized and incapable of explaining concepts in a clear, helpful way. I took Statistics for the Behavioral Scientist with Professor Graham in her first semester teaching it since 1985. The class moves at a reasonable pace and Professor Graham realizes the class has no prerequisites. She holds frequent office hours and is always happy to meet with students. This does not make up for the disorganization, marathon exams, and insane lab assignments though. \nDisorganization: Professor Graham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lectures are so disorganized and rambling it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nearly impossible to understand her point or even to see how the material she teaches matches concepts from the book. Few of the lecture slides have page numbers or anyway of identifying what they cover. Professor Graham writes them by hand on her iPad and they are so illegible you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll spend at least an hour of exam prep trying to figure out what they say let alone what they mean. Also, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no syllabus. For each homework assignment, you have to go back through the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153announcement\u00e2\u20ac\u009d slides for each lecture to see which textbook problems were assigned. Since the titles of the slides are incomprehensible, you then have to open each PDF on Courseworks individually to find additional assigned problems. \nMidterm and final: Both tests are moderately difficult but made much harder by the fact that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very hard to prepare for them. Few of the questions reflect anything covered in the reading and I constantly felt like I was trying to guess what she or the TA was thinking. Both tests are extremely long. After few students finished the midterm Professor Graham promised to make the final shorter. It ended up being 20+ pages with pages of useless explanations and rambling in parentheses. \nLab: A major part of the class is the weekly, two-hour lab in which the TAs teach Stata. We were told we would usually be able to finish the lab assignments in the two-hour period. Instead, students who scored 8+/10 routinely spent 4-6 hours outside of lab working. At the beginning of the semester neither the TAs nor Professor Graham even knew which PCs around Columbia have Stata 12 (go to Lehman computer lab, use the PCs not the Macs) meaning students spent hours looking for a place to do their homework. Some resorted to just buying Stata for their laptops. While lab assignments are a relatively small part of the overall grade, the TAs deduct points over minor details. \nBottom Line: Professor Graham would be an ideal thesis advisor or mentor in the Psychology department, but is pretty bad at teaching introductory material. Take advantage of her willingness to meet with students and her insightful advice, but avoid her class.  \n\nWorkload:\nVery long midterm and final. \n7 problem sets each covering 4 chapters of material and a lecture problem or two\nVery long Stata lab assignments: 4-6 hours each week. \n"

Did we learn anything?\"  You will be baffled as to what to take notes on.\nOther times, however, she will surprise you with her clarity.  That happens too.  It is a hit-and-miss type deal.\nHowever, all in all, if you're at all interested in learning the basics about psychology, this is a good bet.  Except for the essay take-home (which you can do with a partner), the only tests she gives are multiple-choice and straight-forward.  That is to say, if you put the time in and learn the material, the test is easy... if you skim it the night before, it ain't.  \nAlso, this class is really really funny.  Many of the videos that she shows in class are laugh riots-- not all, but many-- and during the developmental psychology unit, she will bring in a baby.  You will watch the baby chew on her doll.  Graham will try to measure the baby's head... that won't work.  If the baby has a favorite song, the class will be coerced into singing it for the child.  \nThis is a fun class.  Keep up with the reading and form study groups for exam prep, and you should do fine.\n\nWorkload:\nLike I said, if you keep up with the reading, it's not bad at all.  Then again, I fell behind often, which made it a challenge come midterm-time.  There are 3 in-class exams (multiple choice), a take-home exam, and optional extra credit assignments toward the end of the class.\n"

Her lectures are dull (they lie somewhere in the realm of actual teaching and rambling, not quite either), and the only interesting things are the days when she shows videos. I dunno, at some point I just stopped going to class.\n    The text book by Peter Gray is FASCINATING though. Very well written, and just amazingly interesting. That may have been the one highlight of the course.\n     I became quite acquainted with the textbook when studying for her exams. Turned out to be a waste of time... her exams are IMPOSSIBLE. They ask you to remember such minor facts or random parts of lectures (which, admittedly, I just flat out stopped attending mid-way thru the semester). I don't regret it though. I received the same grade on the exam that I went to class for and studied minorly for than for the exam I stopped going to and studied extensively. I guess its however you want to deal with teh course. I guess I figured it would be an easy way to fulfill the science requirement. I was sadly mistaken. I hear its easier in the Fall. My suggestion would be to take it there.\n    The largeness of the class also makes portions of it very time consuming, and I feel like a lot of the information could be better presented in a smaller class. Perhaps discussion sections.\n    Wow, I really hated this class...\nWorkload:\nNorma has this theory that since this is a 3-point class, you should spend 9 hours a week on work. You spend 3 of them in class, which leaves 6 hours of homework. Oh, and she's not joking. The textbook is great, but expect 40 pages of reading and above from it for every class.

Perhaps many of you have gotten so used to this wretched style of lecturing (if that is what it is called to read slides out loud) that when you come across a professor who actually teaches, you mistake it for rambling? I will save you from my spiel about how Power Point is killing teaching (and learning), and instead let me say this: Norma Graham is an amazing professor who truly loves to teach, who challenges you to think and read critically, and who will inspire you to think differently about science. Even if you plan to never take another psychology course again, take this class. With her genuine enthusiasm about psychology, with her attitude that science is about continuous questioning and careful investigation, and with her thoughtful approach to teaching, Professor Graham is one of the best professors you will come across in all your time at Columbia.

She shows a lot of videos (so you have to go to class) and then doesn't really talk about them. Part of the problem with the class is that it's virtually impossible to take notes since she really doesn't stay on point. I'd agree that the textbook was good and interesting, but honestly I can read a textbook on my own. I want a professor who's going to add to the book. Unfortunately, Professor Graham just can't stay on track. The course is definitely geared towards those who have already taken a neuroscience class and with her field of research being vision you will get more than you bargained for in that area. If you're content to read the textbook and really gain nothing more than that by all means take this class. My advice would be to take The Science of Psychology in the fall.

            "review_content": "\nI have to agree with the mediocre reviews of this class. Professor Graham seems like a very sweet woman, but this course was pretty much a waste of time. Psychology was reduced to either straight biology or a bunch of broad, untestable generalizations. I don't know if its the nature of intro courses to be this useless, but I certainly had trouble motivating myself to get up at 9 in the morning for this class-- it was usually boring and pointless, and rarely made the material any clearer than the book did. \nWorkload:\nFair amount of reading, midterm, final, and two rather pointless written assignments. Tests aren't so much hard as they are random, to do well you have to have memorized lots of obscure details from the text and the lectures. (that's right, I said lectures-- her tests will ask about what happened in class, so you have to attend regularly, or at least have a friend who attends and takes good notes.\n"

She is well-intentioned and very easy to speak to about anything you are interested in after class or during her office hours (she encourages this every class). While her lectures are not as fact-filled and packed as some lectures in other classes in the field, it it easy to enjoy them after a while. Relatively easy to do well in this class if you do the reading before the test and are willing to put in time and effort for the papers.\nWorkload:\n2, 15 page papers that are somewhat boring and just copying out of the book at times. They are due after the midterm and final. Midterm and Final are mostly multiple choice, some identification.\n"

Perhaps due to the large amount of material covered in the class, most of what was taught seemed superficial. The two tests were somewhat arbitrary- expect to find the most obscure details asked. The class is tolerable- not spectacular.\nWorkload:\n2 written assignments, 2 tests, and you're expected to read practically the entire textbook.\n"

The class is pretty boring, however, in that it is a lot of biology of the brain, sleeping etc. This is not a course to take if you are interested in theoretical psychology. She brought some cool videos and guests but i slept through a very good portion of the course because it was relatively dry.\nWorkload:\n1 midterm and final with a lot of optional extra credit. The midterm and final have a lot of tricky multiple choice based on reading and lecture so if you are bad at those types of tests then stay away. She grades on a strict curve so if you dont do well on the tests then you wont do well in the class.\n"

            "review_content": "\nEveryone else seems to rather like Prof. Graham, so I'd like to provide a dissenting opinion. The fact is, she annoys the hell out of me, and her class is pretty worthless. This class requires a very large amount of reading, almost none of which is covered in class-- Prof. Graham prefers to show videos and waste your time with \"demonstrations\" of small children who come into the class and run around obnoxiously, personality tests, diagrams with pictorial representations of how we process the word \"Cat,\" and the like. She spends time every class with what she calls \"business,\" which deals with the (somehow infinitely complex) class website, the TA office hours, and so forth. She has never really given a substantial lecture, and instead spends time explaining very simple concepts painfully slowly. It would be preferable to read the textbook and not waste your time with class, except for the fact that she takes attendance...and watch for her to swig out of her water-filled Diet Coke bottle mid-sentence--- or maybe that's not really water in there??\nWorkload:\nToo much. About 50-80 pages of reading per week, as well as two painfully boring written assignments-- both 10-15 pages, as well as 2 in-class exams.\n"

How annoying or helpful you find the heavy repetition will depend on how often you show up to class.

It may seem a bit tedious at times but if you tend to skip classes, her reminders can be quite useful. The introductory psychology class covers such a wide range of topics that her lectures sometimes get you more confused because of the new information she brings in. However, she's very engaging, organized, and clear about her requirements and you end up learning very solidly. The good far outweighs the bad.\n"

This class is always crammed to the gills, with people sitting on the floor on the first day so register as early as possible. It's worth it. Prof Graham is a great lecturer, organized and interesting, and the material covered is extremely good. I learnt so much from this one class that it's made me determined to take more psych classes in future. Truly inspiring, and Prof Graham is a great person. Go see her during office hours, she'll take time off to chat with you.\nWorkload:\nYou end up reading most of Peter Gray's rather large textbook, but it's good material and well presented. Try to keep up with the reading or you'll end up in deep shit come midterm/final time. Also, two assignments which require to basically summarize the textbook as well as add some personal input/application of the concepts to daily life. Quite easy. An A is very possible if you apply yourself to the work.\n"
