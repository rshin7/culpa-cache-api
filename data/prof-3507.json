She's not that great at actually teaching about writing or leading class discussions (as most of the class wasn't really interested in what she had to say or responding to it), but if you go to her for feedback, she has very good things to say, she just has a little bit of trouble getting them out. I don't think the class is that great in general, so I don't know if there's much she could do to help. The readings were interesting.\nWorkload:\nNightly readings that were sort of discussed in class, sometimes 200-500 word responses (maybe one every week or two), the three UW essays (with lots of drafts and time in between), and a short retrospective essay....seemed like less than other UW classes\n"
