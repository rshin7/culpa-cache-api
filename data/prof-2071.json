In a class where the writers weren't always chomping at the bit to critique something, Hilma provided a decent substitute by stepping in and letting you know what she thought.  She is very respectful of your writing but also able to give good criticism.  I would have liked her to whip the class into shape a little more (people got away with handing in un-proofread first drafts for the whole semester and everybody always came late and often didn't talk), but all in all she is a nice lady, and of course, the class will get you to write.\nWorkload:\nThree short stories, discussed in class, and revisions.  The revisions do count towards the grade (in addition to perhaps polishing up what you hand in in workshop), so give them an honest effort.\n"
