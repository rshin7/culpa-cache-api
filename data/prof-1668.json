            "review_content": "\nProfessor Sloan knows so much, and that is apparent from his lectures. That having been said, he can be boring and a bit dry, and lectures can tend to drag on a bit. There were definitely times I feel asleep in lecture. You have a textbook, which I found was good because it gave the background to what Sloan would discuss in lectures, but you could really get by without reading it and just going to lectures and taking notes -- for the final, Sloan gives you a list of terms that you will have to know, which do a good job of encompassing everything covered in lectures. He would pick specific overarching themes of the period, and spent several lectures over the course of the semester on historiography, which I found was interesting, but, again, was a bit dry. You also have to read six other books over the course of the semester, some of which are interesting, and some of which are boring, useless, and did not contribute anything to my knowledge of American History (Robert Cole's World, I'm looking at you).\nThere is also weekly mandatory discussion sections. My TA, Eric, was okay, and did a good job of facilitating conversation about the texts we were reading.\nGrading is done randomly, so you can have a TA or Professor Sloan grading your paper and your final, making grading a bit of a mixed bag -- you win some, you lose some. You also don't know which one is grading, which makes it hard to figure out how to do better. The class was also part of the Barnard Writing Fellows program, so you had to hand in mandatory rough drafts of your papers that get reviewed by a writing fellow before you hand in a hard copy. It was good to have someone look at my writing, but it could be tedious at times.\nWorkload:\n3 papers, based on books that you read over the course of the semester. Not all of the books will be covered with the papers, and you will have to refer to them on your final. No midterm. Final is 10 IDs from a list of about 40 that Sloan gives you, and two essays (you have no choices). Mandatory discussion section.\n"

He put in no effort, there was no incentive to go to class or do the readings.  Also, the title of the class was completely misleading.  There was nothing about Locke, in fact we started around WWI, and very little about Luxembourg.\nFor the two class papers that I wrote, he would make meetings to see me and then show up unprepared (without having read my paper).  He would eat during class, he once skipped class without emailing us before hand.  Overall I consider him, ignorant, inconsiderate and unaware.  \nAvoid him at all costs!\nWorkload:\ntwo papers on books, one final paper\n"

We rarely discussed the books, but rather Professor Sloan explained in mind numbing detail whatever happened to be on his mind that day. \nWere the conversation to turn to a debate, he would patronize the class. Were you to disagree with him, he'd correct your grammar instead of responding to any point you may have had. He made it clear he had no interest in getting to know us and his dislike for the class itself. \nThe essays were never returned in a timely manner, making it next to impossible to improve. All notes on the papers were corrections to grammatical mistakes. He rarely, if ever, made comments on the content of the essay. It made it pretty easy to do well, but frustrating to watch hard work go unappreciated. \nHe can be really nice, and at times funny, but all in all, this was not a fun class to take.\nWorkload:\n3 papers, 5 pages each.\n"

I would always throw out current events and enjoy his cynical yet objective-ish response.  As a pretty conservative person I'm always weary of the position professors will take when re-telling history, but he usually steered clear of politics.  The readings were alright, and I skimmed every single book assigned.  The lectures were interesting because he was a never ending pool of facts.  When he would ask a question and someone got it wrong, he would yell \"NO\", but make it funny-- it was never intimidating to have the wrong answer, and actually made class more fun because his response was so hilarious.  \nGood intro history class.  If you put in the time you can learn a lot of dates and facts.  \nWorkload:\nA few papers.  All quite short.  No midterm.  Final consisted of both ID questions, which he provided a study guide for, and then a number of short essay responses.\n"

His detailed and quite immense knowledge of historical trivia made the class enjoyable at times but also off point at others. Most of the knowledge actually retained could have been easily gained by reading through the textbook. The essays were unfortunately focused on the colonial period and religion, both not at the focus of my interest, and the time it took for them to be returned was quite frankly appalling. Nevertheless the course featured some interesting and some controversial readings and discussion sections with Justin Jackson were well-planned and enriching. As a foreigner new to American history this course was way less helpful than it could have been, making it probably enjoyable to those of you who have already digested and hurled out the material several times in your school careers.\nWorkload:\n5 or 6 thick works of history, a textbook on American history by Henretta, 3 5-page papers (graded inconsistently) and a final consisting of 10/50 IDs and 2/3 essay questions.\n"

True, he is sometimes witty and the class is not horrible, but it is certainly not worth the time you spend in lecture, take it from an A student. Read the books yourself or take another class from this time period. (Also, BTW, the class is not an easy A; he and the TAs actually grade essays very carefully.

And if you can't keep up with his fast talking then the textbook is written well enough for anyone to understand. \nProblem 1: He digresses all the time; about New York families, Mayor Bloomberg, Hudson Bay blankets, Jefferson's taste in wine, Lincoln's favorite jam, current movies, random Historians, past Columbia presidents, -- i don't know just some very detailed trivia facts that are unnecessary in a survey-style course. Try to not be side-tracked by these details\nProblem 2: After the lecture, the TAs do all the work -- they grade, they clarify, they run discussion groups - I know there are 40-some students but TAs are always effy - are they grading harder to be impressive? Have they actually done the reading too? \nProblem 3: There are some dense, boring books in this course. If you can't beast through 400 pages of dull colonial history then reconsider this class -- there are 6 very dense books you have to read in a short time period.   \nOther than those few issues, it's one of my favorite classes and I'm not a history major.   \nWorkload:\nReading 10-20 textbook pages a night + 6 dull, dense books (over the whole semester)\n"

Maybe he was having on off semester, but most of the people in the class (there were only 16, and I got the opinion of at least 5 people) really did not enjoy the class and it was sometimes even degrading being in his seminar. He would interrupt people and criticize them really harshly when they talked. I remember in the beginning of the class everyone would raise their hand when he asked a question, but by the middle of the semester when he would ask a question no one would speak for a long time because they were afraid of getting shot down.\nI remember once when someone brought up the idea of academic freedom in the classroom he yelled \"Academic freedom means I get to teach what I want!!\" and totally shot her down. This was one example of many. Usually I am really hesitant to criticize professors but this experience was just too awful not to share.\nWorkload:\nIt was more work sitting through the class and praying you didn't get shot down. Not a huge amount of classwork. It was clear he is a history professor though and NOT an English teacher. He required us to have meetings with him about our papers and the only thing he would ever comment on was our punctuation and not our ideas. Those meetings were definitely a waste of time.\n"

            "review_content": "\nOn the first day of class, Prof. Sloan told us the following: 1. \"The Constitution sucks.\"  2. \"Human rights are a bourgeois fallacy.\"  3. \"The American Revolution was a mistake.\"  Interestingly though, he is quite liberal and those quotes should give you an inkling about how thought-provoking this class is.  He said that it would be a history class, not a course on Constitutional law, but the class was made even more interesting by the fact that that statement turned out to be largely untrue.\nNow for debunking some of the reviews below.  It's true that Prof. Sloan's knowledge of the subject is very obviously encyclopedic.  He will frequently say things like, \"And what do you know about Charles Evans Hughes' second cousin?\" -- a few seconds of silence capped with Prof. Sloan's exaggerated, mock-scornful answer -- \"He once lived at 113th and Riverside!\"  Some of my fellow reviewers have mistaken this and his frequent \"Did you read the Times yesterday?\" inquiries for smugness.  In fact, Prof. Sloan is simply interested in the subject and likes to drop bits of trivia.  I never saw any indication that he thought less of us for not knowing the history of the living arrangements of 19th-\ncentury jurists.\nThe lectures are packed with information, so you will take a lot of notes (about two pages per class in my case, and I write densely).  He doesn't stop on his own to solicit questions, but he is very open to answering even tangential questions if just raise your hand.  By the same token, Prof. Sloan is ready to chat about pretty much whatever you want either after class or in office hours, an opportunity that I strongly recommend you take advantage of, if only out of a desire to get inside his head a little bit.  He is well-spoken and extremely smart, so it can be fun to discuss various legal controversies with him.\nAttendance is critical if you want to do well.  The content of the lectures is quite independent from that of the reading, so you either have to show up and take notes yourself or make sure you have a friend who is not quite the truant you are.  On the exams, you need a fairly expansive knowledge of the cases, laws, and important figures discussed in class and the Kutler reader.  You only have to know the rest of the reading well enough to write a few sentences about each book in the essays.  The book review shouldn't be too bad.  Pick a book that interests you.  Your review should not (!) be a book report.  Analyze how well the author does what they're trying to do, form an opinion, and express it well in your writing.  He lets you hand in a first draft.  If you do that and take his advice, it will help your grade.  An A is within reach is you take thorough notes and nail the book review.  Making a course outline before the final is very helpful.\nWorkload:\nMidterm (25%): five IDs and one essay.  You have to do all five IDs and do not have a choice of essay.  Book review (25%): 10 pages, you have a choice of about 50 books.  Final (50%): 10 IDs, you have to do all 10.  Two essays, you have to do both and don't have a choice of topic.  He recognizes that 50% is a bit hefty and so is relatively gentle on grading the final.\n"

That being said, as the semester went on, things weren't bad at all.  For the most part the teacher plays an extremely minimal role in the class - just sits in the back and lets the students play the games (that's the way the course was designed), so it really doesn't make a difference if you like him or not.  Plus, he's turned out to be nicer than we all initially thought.  He's pretty lenient with papers and such, but in terms of grading, it's hard to say, because I haven't gotten any grades back yet.\nWorkload:\n3 games are played per semester, and you have to write 10 pages per game (which translates into 2 or 3 papers).  It may sound like a lot, but it's actually ridiculously easy because the papers don't have to be too formal; they're just the speeches you give in class and can include a ton of quotes from the books we use, plus its fine if you restate the same point over and over again because you're supposed to be delivering a persuasive speech.

This class did not help me in that arena at all, but rather reinforced my ability to recall useless facts and attempt psychic abilities.  When asked how the class should study for the exams, Professor Sloan told us if we thought hard enough, we could figure out what the questions and IDs would be - luckily there was no choice for either.  My notes for each class were approximately 6 pages, mainly a restatement of the case, with pages and pages of unrelated anecdotes.  Also, be sure you've taken a Foner class or two, because Sloan will no doubt ask smugly \"But you remember that from Foner, right?\"  If you want a kick in the GPA, waste your time cramming for this.  At the end, you won't feel smarter or more accomplished, you'll just feel violated - and rightly so.\nWorkload:\nA load of cases per class and don't forget to do the supplemental reading either, as this is the key to the exams.\nMidterm, Final (exactly double the midterm - 2 essays, twice as many IDs and counts for twice as much, 10 pp \"book review\" (How does one critique a biography?)\n"

            "review_content": "\nI took this class on a whim, expecting it to be pretty interesting.  And much of the material was--the scope of the course will give the student a firm basis in constitutional law.  However, I found this man profoundly disturbing.  I know this sounds severe, but he would get up and ask \"who had read the Times this morning\" and smirk at how unintellegent we were for not having done this.  He would mock people for not knowing trivial historic facts, and make frequent references to his undergraduate experience at Stanford and how he is on the board to make the History SAT II.  I just found him appallingly arrogant.  Like the stereotype of the Ivy League, and the reason that people make fun of people like this.  Furthermore, he was extremely late returning everything, including getting in final grades to the registrar.  Maybe if he took some time away from the New York TImes he could grade on schedule.  A pretty good class, but he's a [culpa censor].\nWorkload:\na midterm, a final, and a ten page book review (SO BORING).\n"
