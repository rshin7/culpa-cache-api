You don't have to have any math sense to get an A in this course. He has office hours each week in which he will go over with you the answer to every problem assigned. The work is standard for Intro to Stats--no surprises, just the essentials presented in an easy-to-understand manner. TAKE THIS COURSE for your math requirement. There were review sessions for the midterm and final. \nWorkload:\nAbout 10 problems per week and a midterm and final. \n"

He is overall a really fair professor - lenient grader, willing to clarify any point he makes, etc. I would recommend taking a class with him for the fact that he makes the info easily accessible, has a good sense of humor, and works with you the whole time.\nWorkload:\nOne homework set a week, one quiz all semester, midterm-final\n"
