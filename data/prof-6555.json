            "review_content": "\n     I found Greg to be really insightful about writing, especially about a writer's unconscious motivations, particularly when things in a piece aren't quite working.  I think his critiques were thoughtful and engaged, although I wish that he would have given more concrete, specific advice in one-on-one meetings.  In these conferences, it really felt like the onus was on us to discuss our own work, and while that can be useful, I thought he was a little too passive in the whole thing.\n     Workshops were usually useful, although (and this could probably be said for many writing profs), I wish he had been a little more active in guiding them.  Sometimes, it wasn't quite clear whether we were calling on each other, or he was choosing who was to speak.  Overall, though, I thought his central teacherly conceit (being aware of \"experience\" vs. \"thought\" in a piece, and how they're connected) made sense.  I'd recommend him.\nWorkload:\n2 submissions for workshop (theoretically supposed to be 10-15 pages, although i don't think he cared about length), 3-4 relatively painless exercises and accompanying readings, weekly critique letters on 3 pieces, and a final portfolio in which one piece has to be significantly revised-- ~1/3 new material.\n"
