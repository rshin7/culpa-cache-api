Discussion sections basically consisted of her having her students copy a table from the book onto the board, or having students list the constitutional amendments.  She was often late, and when she couldn't make a section, rescheduled it for 9:30am, then showed up at 10.  Furthermore, I found her grading to be quite biased.  I received a B+ on my Midterm, so I sucked up and participated a bit more, and ended up with an A- in the course, even though I performed worse on the final than on the midterm.  If you have her, just participate and go to office hours, and you'll be fine.  Just don't expect to learn anything from discussions.\nWorkload:\nParticipation (important, it doesn't matter what you say, as long as it's somewhat related to the topic.)\n"
