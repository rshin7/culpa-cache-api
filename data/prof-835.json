            "review_content": "\nI have had Prof. Morris for two classes thus far, a large lecture class (The Ethnographic Imagination) and a seminary (Ethnography of the Everyday). While this review is informed by the former, it is principally about the latter.\nSome find Prof. Morris intimidating. If that is case, it is because of her sheer brilliance -- not because she is in any way ever less than engaging, encouraging and constructive. At the risk of being accused of exaggeration, I will say that to spend any time with Prof. Morris is to emerge a better person.\nThis seminar in particular was possibly the best experience I have had in my four years at Columbia. The readings were appropriate and engaging, the workload as interesting as challenging, and the classroom itself was well run, with Prof. Morris ensuring that the discussion stayed intellectually solid and relevant to the materials at hand.\nWhile much of the course content may have been of specific interest to Anthropology majors, I would recommend Prof. Morris to anyone who is willing to take the time and effort to get involved in her class. She is rigorous and demanding, but she is also always fair.\nWorkload:\nThe readings are difficult but worthwhile, and the written assignments of fair quantity. Prof. Morris reads all students' works carefully and makes helpful comments.\n"

She's also inconsistent in her policy towards academic bullshit. I didn't mind how much we had to read, I just hated that about half of it was essays in which the anthropological buzzwords and name-checking were more important than the actual argument. If she were just a terrible professor I wouldn't have cared, but she has so many good ideas that I found myself really caring about the class, even when I hated it. I'm not sure whether it's better to avoid the class altogether or put up with the worst of it. It's up to you. Just be prepared for her to surprise you in good ways and bad.\nWorkload:\n*at least 30 pages per week\n*1-2 page response papers that weren't really graded or handed back\n*a group presentation on one week's readings, with a longer response paper\n*10-15 page final paper\n"

She does not avail herself to students and seems inaccessible.  The readings were time consuming and extensive but tied together well and most were pretty interesting. As an anthropology major I enjoyed the class as a whole but would quickly suggest other classes if you're looking for a basic anthro course with a professor more obviously passionate about the subject. \nWorkload:\n6 three page responses (1 per section of reading), discussion section, 12-16 page take home final due a week after the last day of class\n"

It's up to you to decide whether you want to take class with someone whose powers of ideological synthesis and interpretation are truly staggering, or whether you'd rather take a class with a professor who will bother to actually answer even a TENTH of the emails you send her. \nWorkload:\nWeekly reading-- it's a LOT (sometimes entire books, and more, every week) but you don't really always have to actually do it\n1 12-15 page term paper [except she distributes the topics so late in the semester you have about two weeks (not an entire term) or less to do the paper if you want to use one of her topics, which almost every student in my class did]\nEvery other week you must submit a 2-5 page media diary on a topic you choose at the beginning of the semester. These can be easily shat out in three hours, or even two, the day before they're due, but they do require you to be full of interesting ideas and synthesize your own thoughts with what's in the reading. She doesn't grade these, but will write a ton of comments on them, and never tells you how well you're actually doing on them or how they'll translate into your final term grade \n"

She's got a soft voice so sit near the front, but she supplemented the class often with interesting video and audio. The readings were excellent, but who doesn't love McLuhan? Class discussions ranged from non-existent to excellent, but on the whole, everyone has something to say about media. \nOne of the best classes I've taken. She's incredibly accommodating and helpful outside of class. You will want to do well to impress her. Highly recommended.\nWorkload:\nReasonable weekly readings (never impossible), movie screenings, bi-weekly media diary (easy, can be fun if you pick the right media), midterm paper (3 pages, 3 questions, take home), final paper (your choice, 10-15 pages), graded fair \n"

It took me a while to get used to her lecture style because she has a soft voice and really likes to narrow in on one specific point and belabor it, but her lectures will make you think. The texts that we read in the second half of the semester were much more interesting than those in the first, and they are all so different that you get a very broad view of different anthropological studies with a focus on ethnography. There is a lot of reading in this course, but I would recommend it for anyone interested in anthropology who wants to be challenged to really think. \nWorkload:\nFive 3-page papers (one due every other week) that generally respond to any of the texts we've read, and a long paper (12-20 pages) that is worth half your grade due at the end of the semester, plus lots of intense reading\n"

[by the same token, people who want a filler course or superficial cultural analysis should NOT take this class. it will be a waste of your time--and a shame--unless you plan to really engage with Prof Morris and the material]\nProfessor Morris is hands down the most brilliant, challenging and inspiring prof I have had in my past three years at CU. The texts on the syllabus are very interesting, but more than that, her lectures highlight and thematically tie together points and concepts that you wouldn't even think of. The bottom line is, she provokes you to really THINK--think about the texts and think about how you think and listen. By the end of the semester, you will have come so much closer to understanding what it means to be an ethnographer and to write an ethnography. \nAnother amazing thing is that despite/along with her brilliance, she is kind and approachable and promotes class discussion (although I admittedly spent half the semester intimidated by her intelligence). Trust me, if you like socio-cultural anthro right now, after you take this class, you will love anthro. And possibly start laying plans to dedicate your life, or at least your college career, to it. \n\nWorkload:\nheavy reading, but like another person said, you'll want to do it. \n"

As for her voice, it is soft and permanently set in high register, but tolerable as long as her mic is working.  Although I must say her rhetoric tends to be overblown.  And often you sit there wondering if the sentence she started 15 minutes ago is every going to end.  Is there some reason that we must use \"religiosity\" when religion will do just fine, or why one cannot connect two ideas  with a simple \"is\" rather than \"that which is to say\"?  She's brilliant, but to call her articulate and well-spoken, if you ask me, is to be fooled by a bunch of verbal froth and stutter.\nOverall, the course is worth taking and Morris is an  insightful and more than competent professor.  Plenty of great material and a few fascinating lectures.\nWorkload:\npretty heavy.  lots of reading.  two midterm exams, one final (all take-home).  mandatory discussion sections with not-so-fabulous TAs\n"

But that didn't make it terribly interesting for me. Her voice seems to come up in a lot of the reviews, and I have to say it was a problem. She speaks really quietly but likes to have the windows open so the traffic and jack-hammering on Amsterdam drowned her out a lot of the time. As far as the actual class goes, the material was not interesting. I thought I liked anthropology, but clearly no, no I do not. We did read one or two ethnographies that I enjoyed, but a lot of the reading (which is heavy by the way, and expensive) was theory theory theory. Her TAs were alright, but when they decided to grade one of the midterms it was disastrous. When she handles it herself, things are much more fair. She's a nice person and will never tell anyone they're wrong (\"Yes, good, that's a relevant thought, now let's exPAND on it...\") but she isn't very approachable. Her TAs are her mignons and they actually told us \"Anything you want to say to Professor Morris should go through us first. Don't approach her directly.\" Don't take this class if you want an elective. Take it if you are really interested in anthropology and are willing to keep up with the reading and listen to endless inane comments from overly-enthusiastic GS students who don't actually know what they're talking about and want to tell the class about their life as a white girl in the ghetto who couldn't afford Nikes or their \"life\" (i.e. ten days) in Indonesia as a dancer. \"I'm a dancer. That's what I do.\" Yeah okay.\nWorkload:\nmiserable. tons of reading you can't keep up with, but two midterms that are totally manageable if you take good notes. None of the tests are cumulative.\n"

However, while Prof. Morris is absolutely brilliant, I found myself either out of it (comprehension-wise) or sleepy for the first hour while totally enthalled the second hour. Bring some caffeine to get you through that first slot because I always wished I had been awake for it or that the class lasted an additional hour once I was more stimulated from the second hour. Prof. Morris tried to get a group discussion going but it rarely worked well, however she never let a minute be wasted. Every word she says is well thought out and she always ended class on time no matter what. Her points were sometimes a little over my head but as a non-Anthro major, I got a lot from the class in general. She along with the material, really make you think. The best part of the seminar would have to be the discussion section we had once a week. I have never found myself so looking forward to spending the last hour of my week of classes in a discussion but I always looked forward to this one. Don't come to this class if you just want to sit and absorb; even though you can get away with that in the lecture, you have to talk in the section but trust me, you'll want to. The information provokes just about everyone to say something. Hey, don't we all use some form of media?\nWorkload:\n3 short (2 page) response papers that you have to present in discussion.
