            "review_content": "\nOne of the best!  He's funny, competent, charming, and super approchable if you ever need help.  I know he had some health issues this semester so classes were canceled pretty often (like, more than 4 times) which was fine with me, but we still managed to finish the entire course book without any stress or cramming at the end of the semester.  The course was accelerated, but unlike Accelerated Elementary it was a lot less grammar, and we spent many days in between just talking about French movies or watching French news or something.  Samuel is a stickler about pronunciation (especially gender agreement) and overall I think my pronunciation improved a LOT in his class.  In-class worksheets are very helpful and I always felt like review was pretty thorough even though the course moved very fast.  We had short homework assignments on a nearly-nightly basis, which I did pretty rarely, so I got really good at answering on the spot in class.  It never seemed to be a problem, which is great!  Because of the nature of Intermediate French I, the first part of the semester was just review of Elementary French II so that was a really nice time.  Even though the second half of the semester was harder, Samuel is a more than capable teacher who makes class a joy.  After having taken French since September and feeling really nervous for my second intensive semester, I was so impressed by my own ability to discuss more complex news stories, movies, and longer writings in French\u2014progress I credit mostly to the lovely professors I've had.  Overall, Samuel is great and I would recommend him 100%!\nWorkload:\nI don't even remember.  There were some Tests?  And Compositions?  Quizzes are usually ungraded and he gives you the opportunity to correct your compositions (the one or two that he actually returned were pretty thoroughly annotated).  We had two take home tests with notes allowed (but no outside help).  All the tests were fair and not too tricky or cruel.     \nAs I think everyone else has mentioned previously, he will never ever return your grades, ever.  Just do your best, I guess (Samuel is also very kind and it is very possible to get an A). \n"

            "review_content": "\nThis was a great class! Samuel is a great professor who always made class interesting and lively.  Very talkative, funny, and honestly just adorable.  He always provided creative and fun topics of discussion or exercises to do in class as a way of practicing whatever it is you're learning -- which forces you to learn it because you're using it in conversation but also helps students understand how to practically use the grammar rules in real conversation.  My only vice is that we didn't get back graded work in a timely manner at all -- it's the end of the semester and I only know my grade for one test and two compositions. But Samuel has made it clear that we're all doing very well, and if you need to work on something specific he will let you know.  Take this class if you have the chance! Take Accelerated Int. in general; all the profs are good and the class is really a great way to finish up the language requirement if you still need to.\nWorkload:\nWeekly homework in the workbook (never graded), 4 compositions, and 5 tests (2 of which were take-home because we missed a few classes because he was sick).  He assigns some reading out of the textbook, but never very long and if you don't do it it's no big deal because you will most likely read it together in class anyway and talk about the vocabulary and then the text itself.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI really liked Prof. Skippon. He's pretty easy-going in class, speaks French beautifully, and is a fair grader.  He speaks French 90% of the time, but he will break into English if the class is totally lost during a lesson--which is great. He stuck to the syllabus, it was always clear what was expected and when.  He rarely assigned additional work and when he did, he didn't spring it on us last minute (no BS late night emails asking us to prepare something extra).  That made life easy for those of us with lives outside school.  I learned a lot and I felt like I was graded fairly.  You can't ask for much more.\nWorkload:\nStandard for French I: about 5-6 half-to-one-page comp.'s; periodic chapter quizzes every 1-2 weeks, 3-4 multi-chapter tests, fairly difficult exam. He gave 2-3 unannounced quizzes which weren't counted very heavily but reminded you to keep up. Most of the work is outlined by the department, so generally the workload for different sections is pretty similar.\n"

More to the point, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obvious he loves what he does and he is truly a wonderful teacher.  His class has been an immensely enjoyable learning experience for me; there is not one thing I would change about his teaching style.  He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flexible with deadlines and he makes himself extremely accessible (and approachable) to his students.  He consistently goes out of his way to make sure the students understand the material and he always seems to be aware of individually needs.  In short, he will do everything possible to help you learn the language.\nMost of the class is conducted in French, which can be a little frustrating at first, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best way to learn.  When needed, he will answer a question, or explain a difficult concept in English.\nWhen the class began I was a bit overwhelmed as I had never taken a language class before and really did not know how to go about learning French.  The class covers quite a bit of material, and if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay on top of the homework / vocabulary you will be lost.  That being said, if you are willing to put in the work, you will learn a lot and have fun while doing so.\n\nWorkload:\nStandard for the section:  4 tests, 5 short compositions, and a final.  Weekly homework assignments in a workbook \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he checks it once in a while to make sure you are keeping up. Class participation.  \n"

There were regular readings, including an entire French novel, and movies to watch outside of class. \nClasses were pleasant, as Samuel knew how to keep conversation going on interesting topics. He knows the language in a lot of precise detail, and will correct mistakes and introduce you to native phrases. By the end of the term you'll definitely be speaking better and have gained some knowledge of French politics/culture, but know that the class comes with some work. \n\nWorkload:\nParticipation, some articles to read, French novel, out of class movies. A few vocab quizzes throughout the term. Everyone makes one 20-minute presentation on a topic of their choice. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI took French 1101 with Prof. Samuel this summer. We had several students in my class who already had taken a lot of French; this was not taken into account. Instead, the Prof. acted, in my opinion, as though it was the students fault -- who hadn't taken French before -- that they didn't understand the material as quickly as the ones who had taken French before (This was Elementary French 1). Moreover, he returned all of our exams 3 days before the final, corrected but didn't grade the compositions and had no oral exam -- although this was part of the grade breakdown. The most disturbing part, however, was that the Prof. stated that a test would only cover certain chapters, although it covered other chapters as well. If you have taken French before this is, arguably, a good class for getting a high grade in as the tests will cover material not dealt with in class, or otherwise stated to be part of the tests.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI've had nothing but terrible French teachers throughout high school, so I especially appreciated professor Skippon. I learned more in a semester with him than I did in my previous four years. He is a fantastic professor who may appear a bit unstructured, but you simply learn so much just going to class. Accordingly, I highly recommend attending as many classes as you can; it's so much better than trying to teach yourself out of the book. \nHe paced the course just right, and everyone felt prepared for the final. His grading was tough but fair, and he has to be one of the most understandig professors (but, like a previous reviewer said, you won't want to take advantage of him.) He has a dry but hilarious sense of humor, and the entire class has a very relaxed atmosphere. Class participation is a big component of the course, but he doesn't make you feel stupid if you don't know something.\nHe's probably not the easiest French professor, but you will not regret taking him, particularly if you plan on taking higher level classes. \nWorkload:\nRather light. Four compositions, a final project, and daily, optional homework. Although he doesn't collect, you should really do the homework to get the most out of the class. The tests are the bulk of the class; study for them in advance.\n"

            "review_content": "\nFrench with Samuel has been a fantastic experience. I've found that in almost every foreign language class I've taken, the teachers tend to be a little disorganized and don't stay on task, and of course, Samuel is no exception, but we've completed the course without rushing any single part. The workload is entirely manageable, and he isn't too hard a grader. He's also EXTREMELY understanding about extensions, etc.- but you won't want to take advantage because he's so nice. He's a fair grader and sincerely wants and expects you to learn the language and will do whatever he can to facilitate that. All in all, a fantastic language teacher, take the class.\nWorkload:\nSlightly less than your average 2nd level elementary class: 4 compositions (3 of which you get to revise for a higher grade), 4 tests, an exam, an oral presentation, and workbooks. He rarely checks up on other daily exercises.\n"

He makes learning fun and interactive, and has a fabulous sense of humor, and doesn't take himself too seriously.  He does, however, have a genuine concern that students are learning and that the class can forge ahead at the same level without leaving anyone behind. I have taken French before, and thought that the class would be too basic, but he keeps class interesting, and his forays into contemporary French culture and language would keep anyone interested.  Altogether a fabulous teacher, and every effort should be made to get into his section.\nWorkload:\nnot too hard at all...workbook activities, some light compositions, tests, quizzes\n"

Is very willing to explain things if you don't understand or have any questions. He seemed to be a out of place for some time this semester, since we fell behind when he got sick and had to cancel class twice but is an incredibly good teacher. I give him my highest recommendation.\n-If you study once in a while and are good at memorizing vocab quickly, you can do good cuz I didn't study all the time. Only like 1 or 2 a week, when I did homework or were going to have a quiz or test.\nWorkload:\nPretty good. Homework at the end of every chapter. Started off as weekly quizzes but then were just announced, several fairly easy compositions, 3 tests, Oral midterm, and final.\n"

He is a native speaker, so that definitely helps, but he also speaks English with complete fluency and an American accent. He is always available for questions, is quite clear and really wants his students to be successful. The class is very well organized and the written assignments are creative as well. Very enjoyable overall, which is a good thing as the class is at 9am Mon-Fri. Highly recommended.\nWorkload:\ncompositions, midterm, final, assorted supplemental assignments\n"
