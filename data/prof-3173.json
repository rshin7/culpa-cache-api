            "review_content": "\nJon Bogarin expects way too much of his students.  He knows what he's talking about, and he really did teach me a lot, but he had us run around to exhibits all over New York that we didn't even get to talk about!  He also expects students to be able to spend 7+ hours each week painting, when in class we only spent about 3-4 hours with brushes in our hands.\nJon also neglects to paint with his students, or demonstrate techniques himself.  He is also fairly critical, and seems a bit arrogant.\nWorkload:\nat least two paintings in class every day, and at least 7 hours spent painting 1-3 pieces each week.\n"
