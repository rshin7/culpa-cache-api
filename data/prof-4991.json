Midterm, final, and paper count for only 50%, while discussion counts for the other half. All in all a great professor, highly recommend him. \nWorkload:\nReadings, 2 essays, midterm, final\n"

Facilitates discussion well and does a great job of helping students comprehend the themes of every work we read. The fact that he has read almost every book in the syllabus in its original language makes for a very special class. \nWorkload:\n3 quote identity quizzes, 3 papers, 1 midterm, 1 final; A little more reading required than in other classes because Pedro adds 2 or 3 readings/semester, but the readings are worth the extra time required to get through them.\n"
