            "review_content": "\nProfessor Steingart was always VERY prepared for the lectures and easily understood. He speaks slow and clearly and stops to answer questions and gauge feedback regularly along with being very approachable.  Professor Steingart goes out of his way to appeal to students of every department. He is extremely approachable and willing to play devils advocate and entertain questions to spark understanding and learning of the complicated topics at hand. He doesn't just care about his individual research but the actual class content and the ability for students to absorb the information accurately. He has the ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences and goes out of his way continuously and stays after class and shows up early just to assist students. He has the ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics all while not confusing students even further. \nWorkload:\nWorkload was fair and the assignments reflected the lectures and text very well. All assignments were due via courseworks and google drive which allowed for a seamless turn in. \n6 hw assignments \ntake home midterm and final \n"
