            "review_content": "\nProfessor Greene uses his new website (now public!) to teach the class for him. There is a weekly 2 hour session where he reviews the online lessons, which are comprised of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modules\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and then the class goes over some harder problem with Brian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidance. The modules take somewhere between 1 and 2 hours each and usually 4-5 are assigned a week (there are 44 total). The 2nd to last week of class, we go over things beyond the online course, which is cool, and the final week of class is the final (its not during finals week) but Prof. Greene left this up to a vote and we voted for a week early. The online material is slow and at times tedious and boring, but the problems work for helping you to understand. The final grade is based mostly on your performance on the final exam. I got a lot of the online material wrong, but did well on the final so I did well in the class. After each online problem is an explanation of how to do it which is quite useful. \nI did not find either the online class or the session especially wonderful but somehow I learned the material (and I certainly did not study anything extra). \nA few things:\nIt is cool to have a famous professor as your teacher.\nBrian Greene will NOT know your name if you take this class. \nSorry.\nThat being said, he is a hilarious dude, listen to him in the sessions, he is funny when he makes side comments.\nWatch all the videos on double speed (click on the gear in the bottom right corner), it saves you time and saves you time again because I would stop playing attention to his slow voice. On double speed, he talks at a normal, intelligible rate. \nHe knows his stuff and can explain it to you about 7 different ways, make use of this, ask questions. \nHe will always be in character. Less in character than his Novas, but still in character. Enjoy it!\nGiven the choice, I would take the class again.\nWorkload:\nAbout 4-6 hours a week for the online material. Make sure you have done the most recent modules before you go to class, otherwise class doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help. He also dislikes absentees. So go to class.\nIf you ace the final, he curves it. It will be your grade. If you do better on the midterm, he weighs the midterm, online material and final to get your grade. How exactly he weighs things he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say. (Most people I think get As)\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis review is for Greene's Special Relativity class, which is a relatively (no pun intended) new mode of teaching that Professor Greene was intimately involved in creating. It involved a lot of online learning, which is very different than what I was expecting when I signed up for the course. Nevertheless, I did learn a good deal from the experience.\nTo preface this review, let me first say that Professor Greene knows exactly what he's talking about. He knows the physics behind every problem, he has an incredibly intuitive grasp of the material, he gets special relativity. That being said, he's not an impressive professor because there is a significant disconnect between the student and the professor in this course. We weren't really being taught by him; rather, we were being taught by video lectures and things that he happened to be the face of. And we did have the luxury of having a two hour discussion-style section with him every week, but sometimes this time wasn't used well, and many times, it was just arduous to sit through him have back-and-forths with one or two students for an hour and a half. \nIn addition, the communication between Professor Greene and his students was atrocious. About half the class thought the final was a full week before it actually was. Nobody knew how he was grading. It was quite subjective - although, to be fair, he said that he \"adjusted the percentages\" to our benefit. But no one knew if this meant online materials were worth 10% or 90%, if our final was worth 25% or 75%, what our midterm was worth, what our homework set was worth, nothing. He never expanded on this at the end of the semester, either. Just got our grades thrown at us with not the slightest mention of how he got those numbers. I realize that this is rather commonplace at Columbia, but in most classes, you receive some sort of grade breakdown at the beginning of the year - final is worth 25%, midterm worth 15%, things like that. Not with Special Relativity.\nA word about the TA, Andrew Brainerd - I used him as a resource very late in the semester, and it's a shame that I did. The guy knows what he's doing. He's a pretty lenient grader as well. \nOverall, I did learn a lot about special relativity, but it felt a lot more like a slightly-guided, self-taught course where I learned from videos rather than a textbook. If this seems appealing to you, take the course.\nWorkload:\nNot terrible - we had a couple of exercises and \"problem sets\" in our online materials. They were all multiple choice, and not terribly difficult. We had exactly one written problem set that was much more involved and short answer - it was actually really useful, but it was worth a lot. One midterm (take-home). Final was pretty straightforward. \n"

            "review_content": "\nSo, G4022 is meant to be a class for physics majors. Instead, this class is a hybrid mesh of pure mathematics, physics and, albeit interesting, but not particularly useful for a physics majors, philosophy. Compared to how the physics department used to teach this course, this year's class had many holes in it, some of which were patched up in homeworks. Leaving the class to teach themselves half the material always poses risks that a student will not absorb the essentials of qm. \nWith the time remaining towards the end of the course, rather than cover topics the physics department typically teaches, such as the WKB approximation, the variational principle, along with other side topics that improve one's ability to perform calculations, the time was used to lecture about topics that were philosophical in nature. Among the topics were the measurement problem and many worlds philosophy, which, though interesting in their own way, are not helpful in teaching how to actually utilize qm. \nProf. Greene is rather charismatic, but this allows his ego to expand. To end this, physics majors be warned: You will have a major hole in your quantum basics, so be sure to read books and ask questions, but perhaps not ask Prof. Greene... you may just receive a \"PBS Special\" type of answer.\n\nWorkload:\nProblem Set every week, reasonable. One midterm, one final. For the most part, all reasonable (also all made by his TA).\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis professor deserves an unbiased culpa review that doesn't mention his fame.\nBrian Greene is, in short, an incredible Professor, likely the greatest, most fun to listen to, enthusiastic professor I've ever had. He made quantum mechanics seem so easy, so crystal clear, that I felt as if I were taking high school level quantum. Lectures were fun and engaging, questions were encouraged and always answered without judgment. This led to some awkward moments when obvious or annoying questions were answered with as much detail as interesting questions, but made me feel eager not only to ask questions during class, but after class as well. As a note, this was a very tough semester for me as I had to deal with a personal loss, and when I emailed Professor Greene, he said that not only would I be allowed to hand in the next homework whenever I needed to, but he would personally tutor me on any lecture I missed, which I held him to. \nThe material itself was fairly basic quantum; no different than what is learned in the end of PHYS 2601, with more mathematical detail, and I'm pretty eager to figure out where he will take this course when more complex topics arise. It made me feel almost nervous that I wasn't learning enough physics. At other schools people complain that quantum is like the physics major organic chemistry, the sail-or-fail this-will-determine-whether-you-major-in-physics, but I can honestly say this quantum class was the easiest class of my fairly easy semester, if not the easiest physics class i've taken since high school.\nTake it, you will be so happy you did. \nWorkload:\nWeekly problem sets that simply walk you through the material and are often lifted directly from the textbook (and rarely take more than 2 hours), easy midterm that was graded harshly, difficult but not impossible final. Professor Greene said \"If I could, I would give everyone an A.\" Duly noted, I did the minimum and still got an A-.\n"
