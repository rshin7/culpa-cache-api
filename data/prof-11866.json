This is a journalism course with computer science course number.\nThe professor is always talking about something she knows in journalism, and she is kind of \"anti-technology\". Only the guest speaker will leave some programming assignments, which will count 15% of the final grade in total.\nThe final project could be a disaster if you naively think this is a computer science course.\n65% of the course depends on the final project and the instructor strongly prefer it to be a pure journalistic one. No computer science involved.\nWebsites? NONONO! \nPhone apps? NONONO! \nCloud computing? NONONO!\nMachine learning? NONONO! \nData mining? NONONO! \nNatural language processing? NONONO!\nWrite loooooooooong reports? YESYESYES!\n\nWorkload:\nFair...The three \"programming assignments\" are acceptable. Attendances are taken every week. However, the final project is the most confusing part.\n"
