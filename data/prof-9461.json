            "review_content": "\nThis was her first time teaching a class by herself.  She struggled to build enough confidence to take command of the room.  She would ask, \"Does anybody want to comment on this painting?\" rather than, \"How does this painting illustrate concept x?\"  Very few students took up her offer.  \nShe also struggled to organize the lectures, homework and exams.  The requirements for the exams changed several times as students repeatedly stated that existing requirements were too ambiguous or broad to study for.  \nShe seemed to have shored herself up by the end of the semester, but she's still very green.  Get her while she's malleable.  \nWorkload:\nOne midterm and final.  Moderate reading which, I eventually realized, was not necessary for success in the course.  One three to five page and one five to seven page paper, each based on separate visits to the MET art museum.  Attendance and participation. \n"
