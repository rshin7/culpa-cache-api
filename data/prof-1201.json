This year, I needed to get it out of the way in order to take other film courses so I took it with Regan.  On the one hand, Regan's syllabus was WAY better than the first professor, Regan clearly knows what she's talking about, she contextualizes all the films and movements, and she knows how to spark interesting questions about each and every film.  On the other hand, Regan is a bit dry, her powerpoints are stuffed with information and she moves quickly, she responds a little negatively when students profess differing opinions in class (although granted, a lot of those kids were freshmen that rambled about their feelings), and her assignments don't allow for too much freedom.  Overall, I'm glad I took the course, and Regan seemed just as good as professor as any to take it with.  I definitely know way more about film theory and have plenty of interesting quips for cocktail parties and for family dinners when my uncle gets boring.  \nWorkload:\nweekly reading assignments but not too heavy, discussion section with a focus on participation grade, one paper for the semester, one midterm (fair, but tough), one take-home final paper (tough, but plenty of time to work on it)\n"

I would strongly advise those considering not to take it. If you must, in order to fulfill a requirement or take other film classes, so be it. This was by far the worst class I have taken thus far, because she takes such an interesting subject and completely sucks the intrigue out of it. It is not a good foundation for film courses and can often cause students to deplore the subject as a whole. \n She is not open to interpretation in class discussion, (though discussion is a vital part of your grade) and she will intentionally go out of her way to disagree with you despite you reiterating her own interpretation. She also has maintains clear favorites. She will blatantly insult a student for their contribution in class and moments later, praise another student who she favors despite them voicing the same thought. She is a stickler about the theory and her demands are unrealistic and unreasonable. Overall, the exams are not too hard, so if you must take this course, take it at Columbia so that you can interact with the TA instead of having to directly deal with her. \nWorkload:\nAn oral group presentation (be prepared: she will hammer you if there are errors), a paper--15% of grade, a midterm- (not too difficult because you are given choices: study the theory!), final paper- 6-10 pages \n"

Now, I'd like to offer some sage advice:\n1. Know your theory. Really.\n2. Talk to her during the break or after class. You might be shaky and start to point to yourself and say your name before you talk (out of habit), but in all actuality, Professor Regan is very approachable and she always listens carefully to what you have to say. Once, she even gave me  inspirational advice about film making. True story.\n3. Still don't understand interframe narrative? Look it up. That's why God invented the internet.\n4. Print out the lectures beforehand and save yourself from trying to write down every little detail. This will allow you to listen to Professor Regan's lectures, which are always interesting and very well organized.\n5. Sit in the middle. Don't ask. Just trust me on this one.\n6. Enjoy the films! This class provides a really wonderful sampling of different types of cinema and Professor Regan's commentary is helpful in digesting some of the more abstruse elements of the films.  \nOverall: Don't let CULPA scare you. If you love film and you want to learn more, let Professor Regan be your guide. She's extremely knowledgeable, occasionally funny, and she always keeps the class on their toes. \nFin.\nWorkload:\nWeekly theory readings, 1 theory presentation, 1 paper, 1 midterm, 1 final paper.

This may be an intro, but it's a 3000 level class... you should know that it's going to be harder than your average intro when you sign up for it.

You have to listen very very carefully in class because detail is very important, but she made makes most major topics very clear, and is available during the breaks to clarify things. I agree she definitely should have explained the presentations better. And to future people giving presentations in this class: know your theory REALLY well, because she will grill you on it if she doesn't think you know it.\nSo be warned - this class is very very hard, for sure. Be prepared to put in a lot of hours for each paper, and to learn a lot of detail.

It's complement the history part with screening of important films and adds major film theories from Bazin, Doane, Mulvey and many others that provide insights and enrich the course materials (everything from heavy philosophical theories about the nature of cinema to how it plays on and mimics some of our psychological-cognitive processes to feminism and racism.)  It's like Masterpieces of Western Art but with films. This course changed the way you view films and help you become an active spectator. Half the semester covers the works of early filmmaker such as Miles, Porter, Griffith, and Eisenstein and the second moves to more modern films including world cinema.  \nThis great learning experience is of course dependent on professor Marie Regan. On the one hand she is very knowledgeable about the course material and certainly makes the classes engaging and interesting. On the other there is very little real dialogue. She is fixed in her opinions and don't respond to question and ideas that she didn't thought about before. It could be very frustrating, especially if you find this subject interesting as you are forced to this one-way style of learning. She  The TA will do all of your grading and their discussion sessions clarify and expand the lectures and especially the theories. Some of my friends said that it was a waste of time. My TA was Livi Newman and was amazing in every respect. \nOverall:\nI had a great time in this course and actually learned a lot of stuff - even with the small drawbacks of professor Regan it is highly recommended.  \nWorkload:\nAnything from 10-60pg of reading a week - the theories could sometimes be difficult to understand \nOne 7-8pg paper \nOne in-class midterm - multiply choice and four essay questions \nOne take home final 8-10pg \nMedium Workload - got an A\n\n"

Which means a pretty healthy mix of film nerds and first and second years who have no idea what the hell they're talking about, but like to think they do, anyway. What I don't get is why we even bother to read film theory when the T.A just glazes over it in class and doesn't even bother to elaborate on *any* of the major theorists referenced in the readings--how can you talk about the beginning of film without referencing Benjamin or Kracauer, especially to a bunch of freshmen who have no idea who they are? Anyway, Regan is okay, though rather rigid, she seems smart--despite the fact that she referenced the Russian constructivists as people who \"constructed things into abstract art.\" I guess her, and the T.A's, missed the memo that film didn't develop in a vacuum. I'm obviously not a film major, but I'd much rather watch these films on my own time and skip the 5-\nhour hell where people make such comments as, \"I'm so over dialectical montage--they use it on FRIENDS!\" Somebody shoot me.\nWorkload:\nmedium--about 60 pages of reading a week, which may seem dense to those who'd rather glue their eyes to a screen instead of read the theory behind it...\n"

She also has a thing about noise, students running late, and she loves to yell at the projectionist.  She tells students to move a light dry erase board rather than do it herself.\nIf you speak in class, you'll get a good participation grade, but beware...always repeat what she has said--she doesn't like you having your own theory.  Stick to saying \"gaze\" a lot and \"dialectical montage\" and you'll be fine.  If you love film, this class will suck that passion right out from you.

            "review_content": "\nThis 4 hour long class was extremely enjoyable, not only because of the wonderful films we saw in class, but because of Professor Regan's ever interesting lectures. Though the class is always very large, about 50 students, she runs it like a seminar. Everyone has ample opportunity to share their views. The readings, though copious, were enthralling. Though she did pick certain \"unoriginal\" films such as Citizen Kane, we also saw many films I'd never heard of. We went through everything from the silents, to expressionism, to genre films, to the french new wave and italian neorealism, to the avant garde movement, to the modern d.v. phenomenon and we ended with the Danish Dogma movement. If you're going to take an intro to film class - TAKE HERS! \nWorkload:\nA 5-7 pager early in the semester, in class midterm, in class quiz and 7-10 page final paper. A LOT of reading, but not all necessary and it's really interesting reading anyway. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI enjoyed this class and found Marie Regan to be a competent instructor. The syllabus reflected the broad nature of its subject and included many classics that deserve to be watched and re-watched. Also, Prof. Regan made an attempt to cover current and international examples of cinema and include them in an ultimately well-streamlined course. Class time was well-paced and organized, and I always felt like I was learning something important. My only complaint was with Regan's attempts to lead class discussions: she seemed well-intentioned, but often came across as opinionated, which was very frustrating to students who felt like she was not receptive enough to their ideas if they were not exactly what she was thinking. The TA's were great, and discussion sections were pretty painless.\nWorkload:\ntwo in-calss exams that require knowledge of lectures and readings. Very fair. One 5 page paper, a 10 page paper instead of final. Attendance. Weekly readings. Workload was sometimes rather heavy, but it was all interesting and educational.  \n"

            "review_content": "\nI felt a duty to post something because I disagreed with most of the other reviews. I think that first one is too harsh: Prof. Regan does know her stuff, she is smart and has good tastes (I think). I thought the syllabus was well put together, even for \"serious\" film students. However, I agree that she does not know how to lead a discussion - partly this was the class' fault, but I think Marie could have done a lot better. I hardly ever gained real insight from the tedious discussions, and she rarely responded to student comments. They would go something like: \"that first scene had lots of close-ups.\" \"yes.\" \"that part had colorful costumes.\" \"okay.\" Also, the first paper was basically a test to see if we could spit out all the terms she'd written up on the board; it required no analytic effort. I know a lot of people had qualms with her grading, which was sometimes unreasonable and definitely inconsistent (and I have never complained about grading before at Columbia). Further, she missed the last few classes and the discussions were led by the TA and a guest lecturer. I had thought the discussions couldn't get any worse, but I was wrong - it was completely ridiculous. And to top it all off, she failed to bring the class evaluations on the last day. All in all, I can imagine worse, but a lot of things about this class annoyed me, and I would avoid it with Prof. Regan if possible.\n"

            "review_content": "\nMarie Regan is the only professor I have had in 2 years of Barnard and Columbia classes that has made the time and money I've spent here worthwhile.  She is engaging and engaged with her material, she knows the films she discusses well - both in technique and in history; she is open to students' comments and still manages to keep the class moving at a good pace (for a 4 hour class this is VERY important).  AND, though teaching 2 classes of something like 50+ students, plus pursuing her own interests outside of class, she still managed to know the names of almost everyone in my class of ~80 people by the end of the term (which is not to say she will coddle you, she expects the work to get done on time). \nThe exam questions (which apparently previously were unreasonable) seemed to me quite reasonable, and I only felt constricted for time on one of the 2 in-class exams. \nI would recommend this class to anyone interested in starting to study film, and this professor to anyone interested in taking a class that will be worth your time and effort. \nBefore taking this class i had NO faith in professors at this university; now I know there's at least one good one out there.\nWorkload:\nreasonable; it may change each term - we had 2 exams and 2 essays (the final exam was a  take-home essay)\n"

(I took the class apparently at the same time.)\nI also disagree and feel this person was *way* too harsh. The one major flaw was the exams: too long. She needed to work on that aspect, but that's easy to fix. \nAs for the criticism that the films we saw were \"redundant,\" this is totally bogus. It is an *intro* class--this is the one where you're supposed to see these basic films and attempt to analyze them carefully. (It's the *other* classes we take in the film department that are \"redundant.\" The more advanced classes repeat the basics much more than they should.) On the other hand, what's the problem with seeing a film more than once and getting a different perspective on it? \nAs for discussion, keep in mind that the responsibility for good discussion really is the students'. I thought that the chemistry was terrible in the class that summer, and, trust me, getting students to talk can be an impossible task. And, in any case, I never heard Marie Regan say \"So, what did you guys think?\" and leave it at that, like so many other professors in this department do. (And that's all the discussion we get out of them!)\nAnd, as for the workload, what's up? It's a summer intensive course! You're supposed to work hard (15 weeks in 6). I think the diary is an excellent way to make sure we do some active thinking about all the films we saw. There were no specific guidelines, but that's OK--it was supposed to be our thoughtful reactions.\nI really felt she was an engaging and interesting speaker. She really seems to know her stuff and did a much better job of presenting it than most of the professors I've had in this dept. (Her model is clearly Richard Pe\u00c3\u00b1a.) Of course, this was my first film class, so I was reading things I'd never read before and seeing films in a new light, but like I said, it *is* an intro class. And now that I'm a jaded film student sick of the rotten teaching in this department, I'm nostalgic for class with Marie Regan...\nThe only thing that I felt could have been sharpened was discussion of theory (especially contemporary theory), but I haven't seen anything in this department yet that suggests *anyone* is cutting- edge in that sense.\nWorkload:\nA good amount, but basically fair for a summer intensive course: biweekly reading assignments; diary (one entry per class), midterm in class; final take home (too long. Future students should try negotiating a reduction)\n"

Since this is a theory class, the theoretical readings are crucial to papers, test, you name it.\nThe class is structured, focused, with fun and interesting lectures.\nWorkload:\nHeavy reading, 2 papers.\n"

Upon enrolling in her summer course, I found Regan to be extremely endearing (she had never before taught at Columbia and started out nervous but quickly unraveled into a captivating, enthusiastic lecturer).  In fact, I'd rank this couse as probably the most fun course I've taken at Columbia, HOWEVER I have never before taken a film class and was watching all the movies for the first time. Also, I had a crush on Regan, who bears a resemblance to Julianne Moore. Nonetheless, if you are a Barnard student looking to fulfill an art's requirement or if you are just looking for an entertaining (albeit challenging) course this is an excellent, fufilling class to take. I loved almost every minute of it.\nWorkload:\nTOUGH but worth it. I took the class in the summer so had enough time for all the loads of work, but perhaps it would seem unreasonable during a normal semester\n"

            "review_content": "\nSerious film students and those who love film should avoid Prof. Regan at all costs. Her selection of films is almost completely redundant for those who have taken a film class before (Citizen Kane, Stagecoach, The Big Sleep, etc.), and her lectures add nearly nothing new to the experience. To her credit, she includes a Dogme 95 film, Celebration, but nothing else new. She assigns a mandatory film journal that turns the experience of independently discovering readings that should be optional (some are very good) into a painfully tedious chore. Additionally, Prof. Regan's tests are unnecessarily difficult - when a single essay question would suffice, she asks four - and designed so poorly that even the best film students will have difficulty demonstrating their knowledge. Since the summer class incorporated a discussion, it bears mentioning that Prof. Regan is a terrible moderator of class discussion, and simply does not yet know how to ask the right questions of her students. Consider yourself warned.\nWorkload:\nMany readings - all mandatory - in order to complete a \"film journal\" of moderate length with a nebulous purpose, one two-page paper, one six-page paper, and a take-home final exam with five essay questions (each essay takes up five to six pages)\n"
