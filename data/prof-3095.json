            "review_content": "\nAnthony's a very nice guy and he's definitely passionate about what he's teaching.  To be honest, I would not have taken music hum if it had not been a requirement.  While I did learn quite a bit from the class, I wouldn't say the course succeeded in making me fall in love with music completely.  \nHe assigns around 30 minutes to 1 hour worth of reading every night. The readings are very manageable and he goes over the musical periods in class accordingly. He's very receptive to opinions and suggestions, I don't think there was a single time where he said something along the lines of \"you're wrong\".  There are around 2-3 papers per semester and these along with the exams are very fair.  If you study, you'll do alright on them.  He's rather lenient actually.\nTo sum things up, he's an EXTREMELY nice and sweet man; check out his resume too, he's like a genius.  He's very passionate about the material taught and he wants us to feel the same as well.  However, he's not the most engaging of lecturers, so he kind of falls short in this regard.  If you manage to focus completely in class, you'll learn a lot from him and earn a good grade in this class.\nWorkload:\n2-3 Papers (very lenient grading)\nMidterm and Final (Listening, short questions, essays) - very fair\nDaily Readings - 30 minutes to an hour; not bad at all.\n"
