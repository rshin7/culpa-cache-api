Overall, I have enjoyed having class with him, although his tests are relatively difficult(though not impossible). I would say the test(there are three equally weighted tests) average is about 75-85%. There are no curvebals on the tests, and he will not put anything on the tests that he hasn't actually gone over in class. Answers emails very quickly, although is very difficult to get a hold of after class and doesn't really have office hours. \nAlso, Professor Terryanne Maenza Gmelch was my lab instructor, and she is lovely and very helpful. \nWorkload:\n3 equally weighted tests and \"lecture responses\" for each class, which is basically an in-class easy worksheet you fill out to prove you attended class. If you're also taking the lab, your lab grade is 30% of your final grade. Trip to the Met and trip to the American Natural History Museum. \n"

There is quite a bit of chemistry involved and lots of memorization required for the exams.  Lab is fairly easy, but A LOT of busy work.  Lab reports are not difficult, but very time consuming.  Sometimes you do fun things like boat on the Hudson or walk through the park.  Sometimes you do not so fun things like concave maps for four weeks.  At times the class seems to lack cohesion as there are so many components: several books (Never Cry Wolf, Silent Spring, etc), nuclear power, the Hudson River, art history, groundwater, etc.  Even though I didn't enjoy this class at times (especially second semester), I do leave it feeling pretty well versed in many aspects of environmental science.  Bower is pretty funny in class (perhaps more so when he's not trying to be) and is perfectly nice when you go to him with questions.  I can't give this class a rave review, but it's not so bad either.\nWorkload:\n2 exams and non-cumulative final (20% each)\nLecture Responses (10%)\nLab (30%)\n"

            "review_content": "\nnone of the reviews on here really helped me much when I was trying to decide if I wanted to take this class, so I decided I would try my hand at it, and include more details about what the class is actually like and what you will be doing.\nComing in, I had yet to fulfill the science requirement, really really didn't want to do it with psych (not just bc people think it's a cop-out, but bc I fell asleep in the pysch class I would have otherwise taken.) So for someone like me, who wants to actually learn some science but blanks out when expected to do more than one problem with numbers in it- this is the class to take.\nWhat the course actually is:\nFirst semester: The Hudson River. you learn about what an estuary is and what lives in it, lifecycles of organisms, and the whole ecosystem. For example, how a particular fish reproduces and travels out to sea, when it returns to freshwater, and monarch butterflies. Learn the map of the Hudson and where all the towns are. how to test for suspended matter and contaminants in the water.\nSecond semester: Brownfields (aka polluted sites and what to do about them), contaminants (chemical and nuclear/radioactive) and how they leak and pollute the environment. environmental law (via a court case about a factory that dumped chemicals and kids in a nearby town that got leukemia). a little basic chemistry, good review. Groundwater, soil, and river systems (which sounds dull but I liked that part). in lab, you do a simulated ESA (environmental site assessment) with an online program Professor Bower designed. you act like a real environmental team and go to a site, check it for pollutants, make recommendations for cleanup. A former student got a job because she impressed the interviewer by knowing exactly how to do an ESA- a fact that Prof Bower will mention every other class. hey, he's allowed to be proud.\nPros and cons:\nPro: definitely the trip on the Sea Wolf, sailing on the Hudson river- a highlight of the course. the trips around Morningside heights, getting to know our neighborhood in new ways and exploring corners of it I'd never been to. planting flowers in riverside park. When I travel on the subway I understand why the subway goes aboveground at 125th (has to do with the bedrock!) I never understood before that organic food is not just a fad, and what chemicals actually do to you.\nCon: the labs that aren't super cool are SUPER boring and pointless. painfully so. like, holding your eyelids open to pretend interest, while imagining ways you could push the hands of the clock forward without anyone noticing. and too many labs involved coloring on maps with colored pencils. I'm in college, not kindergarten, thanks. Still, you survive.\nalso hated the art history stuff- if I wanted an art history class I wouldve taken one. you have to learn about Hudson River school paintings and I never saw the point. And Prof Bower cannot talk about any kind of fish without mentioning a recipe at some point. Lab reports are tedious and frustrating.\nYes, the course can feel scattered and random sometimes, but as Prof Bower says, \"your education is what you remember after 6 weeks,\" and you will learn a lot and have experiences that will be much more memorable than the nitpicky exams and lab reports. I do feel that I know a lot more about the environment, both ecosystems and pollutants, than I did before this class, enough to make me feel that taking it was worthwhile.\nWorkload:\n2 midterms and a final each semester.\nThere are some readings, you can do them in pieces or all at once (Never cry wolf, a civil action, silent spring are the main ones.) You fill out the lecture responses as Prof Bower addresses each topic during lecture, and hand them in before you leave.\nThen you have the horrible lab reports which come up a few times a semester. Nitpicky horrible grading system and really tedious and time consuming, you can do them the night before but it is stressful. Not exactly busywork, as others below have called it, although yes its boring. But harder than just copying answers. Second semester its a little easier to figure out what the requirements are. I disagree with anyone who says its an easy A, not when you get 10 points off every other section because you mislabeled something stupid, even after working on it half the night. I really hated them. But definitely better than chem or bio.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI really enjoyed this course. I am not a science person and took it to fulfill the lab science nine ways of knowing for Barnard, and I am glad I did! I was actually surprised how much I ended up liking the course, and by how much I learned. Professor Bower is clearly very excited by his subject, which is refreshing. He can get a bit ridiculous at times (talking about how he was once colleagues with George Bush, regaling us with stories of his fancy boat, etc), but he is quite amusing. He also really seems to appreciate other facets of the science, such as incorporating art, music and literature into the course, which made the material more interesting.\nYou do have to go to every lecture because he gives out worksheets that you turn in at the end of the lecture with your name (his form of taking attendance), but hey, at least the lecture isn't at 9 am. The lectures aren't that boring because Bower is an engaging speaker, and when he isn't, you can just do readings for other classes. His tests are fairly easy, just be sure to study- he tells you exactly what to expect. He is a pretty reasonable guy.\nThe lab section was my favorite, you actually get to do pretty cool stuff (go on a boat on the Hudson, go to the AMNH, etc) and Terryanne is the coolest lab instructor ever.\nOverall, it's not a bad course to take if you want to get the science requirement out of the way. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is passionate about Environmental Science, because it is a pretty easy course. However, like I said before, for those of us who aren't passionate about ES, you learn quite a bit about the basics.\nWorkload:\nAssignments for each lecture that you absolutely do not have to do (they aren't turned in, helpful however if you are confused on something), readings from time to time, two midterms, a final, and the book \"Never Cry Wolf\" (super easy read).\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Bower is a professor unlike any other I have met. He is clearly very excited by the subject matter, and demonstrates a serious passion for environmental science. However, Professor Bower is overall an ineffective teacher. He often went on unrelated tangents, breaking the rhythm of the lecture. I remember a lecture that was supposed to be about fish life cycles in which he talked about etiquette for ten to fifteen minutes. His teaching methods were often rudimentary and condescending...I felt as though completing handouts with every lecture was very much a high school tactic. It seemed as though Professor Bower had trouble engaging students with the material. The expectations he had of students at the beginning of the course were low, so students consequently put in only enough effort to pass. \nI would not recommend this course to a Barnard student. I certainly learned a lot of information about the Hudson River, but overall, I think the course sets low expectations for its students, and encourages a superficial understanding of the material. Most students (including myself) felt unmotivated to put in a serious effort because those efforts were not constructively evaluated (for example, getting 100 on every assignment simply because you completed it). This view was exacerbated by the fact that students were not required to take comprehensive notes; every lecture was accompanied by a handout with questions. I found myself (and most other students, after talking with them) listening to lecture only for the answers to the questions, as that would be the material we would be tested on. \nThe structure of the course is incredibly scattered. Although the objectives of the course were not those of a typical environmental science course, it felt difficult to keep up with what was expected of me, as much of the subject matter was scattered. I often felt like I was learning various facts without any cohesion or unity. It would have been much easier if the course was structured in chapters or units. The course was sometimes focused this way, but for the most part was not (for example, we learned about food webs at two different points in the course). I also felt like many of the topics covered were completely unrelated to the Hudson River, the primary subject matter of the course. I found little relevance in studying wolves in a course about the Hudson River. I also found it confusing to be writing an essay for a course that was forced to be interdisciplinary-I found myself wishing we did more hard science.\n\nWorkload:\nEasy, but all of it is busy work. 2 midterms, a final, handouts with every lecture. 12 lab assignments that include a few lab reports, worksheets, field-journals and self-guided tours, along with a final power point project on a topic relating to the Hudson of your choice.\n"

It is a 4.5 credit class; 50% of the final grade is lecture, 50% is lab. Bower is an incredibly random lecturer. He's hard to follow and kind of a wild card, but the material is SO basic. Lectures are very boring. If you do the readings, which are actually kind of interesting, you will get good grades on the tests. The last couple tests were take home and he gave us the answers!\n   Labs were actually interesting. Diane was my lab instructor and she is very enthusiastic, also an easy grader. I received 100% on almost all of my lab reports.

            "review_content": "\nThis class is love or hate. I thought this clas was wonderful. We went on cool field trips, like learning about the geology of Morningside Heights, identifying flora and fauna in Riverside Park, and taking a boat out onto the Hudson River doing samples and collecting creatures. We did interesting lab work, although it was rather tedious -- but, really, do you expect anything else in a science lab? \nBower had a very interdisciplinary approach to the course, which is what I think attracts most people who may be intimidated by other science courses. Everything in the course related back, somehow, to New York City and/or the Hudson River. Art, for example, was an important aspect of the course. We were sent to museums (like the Met) to look at perceptions of nature from the Hudson River School painters. Yes, the scavenger hunts were very high-school-esque, but they made sure you saw the things he wanted you to see, and if you put a little effort in you would get a lot out of the trip.\nI actually liked doing the homework, partially because it was the directed busywork that it was. I had lots of difficult texts to read for other classes, and so I was grateful for the time I got to sit with a list of prepared questions and find the answers in the reading for environmental science. I was being productive while at the same time giving my mind a break.\nAnd just as the class is love or hate, you will either do really well or you will do terribly. And this class is NOT worth doing terribly in. If you do the (simple) readings and the worksheets you are asked to do (it's really not so much), you will get an A. Put a couple neurons of that smart brain of yours towards the class and you will succeed with flying colors.\nWorkload:\nSignificant, but nothing terrifically mentally challenging.\n"

However, be warned: do not underestimate the annoyance and agony described in some other reviews. Many of my classmates, who would have been perfectly capable of acing his open-notes tests, decided to pass/fail the class because they were sick of wasting too much time on the busywork reading assignments (sometimes relevant, sometimes about good recipes for trout) and boring, irrelevant lab reports (one was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153field journal\u00e2\u20ac\u009d about our walk to look at and analyze the building composition of various structures in Morningside Heights- when we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even studying geology at all).

It was completely useless. His weekly quizzes become a joke, you are bored out of your mind during class, and the material is so unnecessarily repetative and nothing to do with the environment outside of NY. If you want to learn about the Hudson River, then this is for you. His teaching method is boring sheerly based off of the fact that he talks about irrelavent things & plays music all the time. \nYou will fall asleep. No doubt. Half the class ended up taking the class P/D/F because the work is so time consuming..NOT because it is hard..because it is ALL BUSY WORK ALL THE TIME. You get nothing done when you look back on your semester. For an environmental teacher, he handed out more packets of paper than ANY class I've EVER taken. So much for saving trees. His quizzes are condescending because they are literally out of the book, and the way that he teaches is ridiculous. Think 7th Grade science class with more work just so it can be considered college level. I could not understand the grading technique at all, even though he tries to map it out. He seems to care more about his research as a scientist then this ridiculous class...but the Hudson River Report is vital to your grade, that's about all I got out of this. He's nice though, have to give him that. Take the class. Don't go to lecture. The work is ridiculous. So...all in all, perfect for a requirement filler!\nWorkload:\nEasy. Weekly quizzes (questions about the reading are given to you AND it's OPEN BOOK), Hudson River Report (don't leave it til the last minute), and a final (just like a quiz but with an extra page)..and some map quizzes\n"

He repeats everything you need to know several times, and he says it exactly in the form you need to know it.  The reading is great, and not dense, and the questions he asks are straight out of the book. He specifically gives a lot of work so that each assignment has little value on its own and nothing screws you over.  There are many opportunities to do well.

            "review_content": "\nWell now that the second semester is winding down I can give an educated review....A lot of people taking this class, including myself, were in it for the Gen Ed. requirement, not for the science. In retrospect, Bio might have been a better choice. \nThe first semester was somewhat interesting. The labs were for the most part pointless, but learning about the Hudson River from many different aspects had its advantages. The excessive reading of \"The River\" was completely unnecessary: pure, unadulterated busy work. Also a little too much info about fish. I got an A first semester, so I really shouldn't complain too much. However, the class presents so many opportunities for students to be annoyed beyond belief that it's hard to be appreciative of the good grade. \nThe second semester has been rough. We are currently dealing with a fake town full of fake people, trying to determine if a fake factory polluted the fake ground. You tend to feel delusional when you realize you're having a serious discussion about a completely fictional scenario. (The people have names like D.S. Gruntl and Ivana Lede. It's pretty sad.) We are in the midst of this report about the whole fake town (it's too weird to explain to those who haven't experienced it firsthand), which has presented the opportunity for an entire weekend's (in my case) worth of busy work. In essence, we have to reword some of the 68794854 documents that we have been given and make our own \"official Environmental Site Assessment.\" We also have had a lot of reading, but it's been on A Civil Action, which is an amazing book. The subject material has been scattered as well. We go over chemistry, groundwater movement, reading comprehension (he needlessly summarizes A Civil Action) and whatever else pops into his head over the course of one class. The labs have been worse this semester as well. We have had to methodically draw and color our own maps, which takes basically all of lab time plus a lot of free time as well. And it's coloring, which is fun for about twenty minutes, not the 2 hours that's necessary to finish.  \nBower himself is not a great professor. He's intelligent enough, but he doesn't keep track of his lectures, apparently; he will repeat on Wednesday basically an entire lecture that he has given on Monday. It's a huge waste of students' time. I've had to fight back the urge to scream more than a few times. The class is a weird mix of people who love him/environmental science and people who hate them both. This leads to high tension within the class; people who are interested enough to ask questions are met with strong opposition by the people who just want the class to be over. I was somewhere in the middle; I found the subject matter at times interesting, but the manner in which it was taught could be vastly improved if we could apply our scientific knowledge to actual real life (and all of the current issues in environmental science) instead of a fake factory. Bower's habit of repetition is also rough, especially now that the semester is almost over. It's gotten old to the point of ignorance; he makes it really easy to not pay attention to him, because you know that you're not missing anything. He's also been really cranky this semester, I think because he got knee surgery. He won't let people walk in front of him (arrogant!) and has weird little routines, like officially starting the class by putting a flag in a pot. \nOn a side note- Diane is an excellent lab instructor. She tends to be a little unfocused, but she genuinely is happy to see everyone and her smile is welcome compared to Bower's surly mug. She truly appreciates the amount of effort that her students put into their work, and she is happy to help you with any questions. She also helped lighten our workload for this final report slightly; she delivers suggestions from the students to Bower and sometimes gets him to ease off on the assignments. \nI can't say how other science classes are, but if you need to fulfill your science requirement, then Environmental Science will make you frustrated, stressed out, pissed off, and in the end you'll be done. \nWorkload:\nWeekly quizzes (both semesters); 25 page report on the Hudson River (Fall) and 10-15 page report (Spring), which also includes many hand-drawn maps; Tons of reading, which you need to at least skim for the quizzes; LONG labs; and in general a weird variety of homework that might confuse you but isn't too difficult\n"

            "review_content": "\n(Class co-taught with Paul Richards)\nAbout the profs:\nThis was a fantastic class.  Professor Bower gave great lectures and really engaged the class well.  It was interesting to hear about his experience as an environmental consultant, as well as his work/visits to various sites, like Chernobyl. I know people find him pompous in Intro classes, but this was not my experience in this class at all.\n Professor Richards was less engaging, and had a tendency to remain aloof, especially during classes when he was not instructing.  A few times he fell asleep during class or otherwise zoned out, so when students asked pertinent questions and Bower asked for Richards' input, Richards had no idea what the question was.  To cover up his embarassment, he just gabbed about something totally unrelated . . . it was infuriating.  I also found his lectures rather boring, although it was apparent that he was very interested in the subject and wanted the class to ask questions, etc.  I hear he's teaching the class himself now, so I will let you all know that he does have redeeming qualities, too. (All is not lost!) \nFirst, Richards is a brilliant scientist and works on cutting-edge seismology research.  I attended one of his lectures about his own research at the Earth Institute last semester which was fascinating.  Also, if you ask questions or talk to him, he really cares about what you say and remembers who you are-- he even sometimes brings articles to class for individual students relevant to their independent projects, etc.  So, I'd say he's a very kind and capable professor, just a bit uncomfortable at first, and not used to teaching. (Last semester, I believe, was his first time teaching in a long time, if not the first time ever).\nAbout the class:\nThis class was nearly entirely dedicated to nuclear weapons, proliferation, and policy.  We did discuss biological weapons and chemical weapons, but my memory was that this was only 1-2 classes during the whole semester.  That said, the class content is great-- it provides 1. a crash course in particle physics (atomic structure, particle decay, etc., basically no math/formulas); 2. a critical understanding of the nuclear fuel cycle; 3. historical context, e.g. Hiroshima, Chernobyl,terrorist risks to power plants, etc.; 4. policy angle- knowledge of political climate and proliferation; and 5. places the issue on the front burner-- good preparation for students pursuing further study or who plan to become involved in policy or leadership positions in the future.\nI went into this class with nothing more than curiosity (and high school envi sci and physics) and came away with a great appreciation for the severity of the current nuclear situation and the fragility of our existence.  I even declared a specialization in envi sci after taking this class.\nThe workload is lengthy at times, but entirely fair.  I would say it is an easy B+/A- and for conscientious students, you will earn a solid-- if not high-- A.  \nAttendance: Not taken. Also, FYI: I am one of those people who does not attend meetings of bad lecture classes. So it does mean something when I say I went to every one of these. \nWorkload:\nproblem sets, fair and from class notes. in-class mid term and final, also utterly fair and I think we were allowed to use notes or a cheat sheet on both; powerpoint presentation on nuclear topic; readings include Hersey's Hiroshima, and tons of interesting articles from the NY Times and other sources. Buy the Nuclides and Isotopes book-- it's cool and pretty to look at, and useful to have as an educated human being.\nTake this class. You will not regret it.\n"

This is an intro to ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE class, what do you EXPECT to learn?  How much depth can you really cover in such a science class- it is an intro (oh mind, the directly- previous 3-4 reviews were about 1st semester ONLY don't forget-- i am good friends w/one of the head T.A.'s who has taken the course both semesters last yr & was informed by her, that during the 2nd semester, you learn a lot more about environmental policy & environ. preservation details, etc. =  more interesting).  Contrary to other people's heated & fuming rants about how much of a waste this class was, I found myself learning A LOT about the wildlife (wolves~ so much info about them!), the ecosystems & the vital ecological cycles in our environment.  The salt and freshwater lectures even helped me to understand the science behind that movie- The Day After Tomorrow.  Don't expect to come out of the FIRST semester of this class with a boundless amount of newly-acquired scientific theories & facts; instead, expect to come out of it a bit peev'd at how much you've had to read, but also satisified with how much more you DO know about owls, wolves, caribou, wildlife, estuarines, salt/freshwater balance, phases of the moon, and the Hudson River.  All-in-all, this is a course about how interconnected everything is in the environment- if we harm one tiny part of our environment, it may have detrimental effects on a number of other organisms/environmental cycles.  Also, I really appreciated the MET visits & the American Museum of Natural History- those museums are incredible & priceless to our society at large.  \nWorkload:\nNot hard but expect to spend a few hrs a night or two before the small weekly-tests to simply read & mark down which pg the answer to each practice question is found on.  It's really simple guys, but because there is a lot to read, you DO learn.

I've never written a CULPA review before now, but I feel it'd be irresponsible not to after having taken this class. F**KING AWFUL. God how I loathe it with the fire of ten hundred thousand suns. .no, it really is that bad. A black hole of pedagogical suck, Bower is unfocused, indifferent, and rude, and yes--his lame attempts at wit really really grate. I'm so glad to know someone else actually finds him unfunny. 'Depressing beast,' as another reviewer described him, is just about perfect. His lecturing 'style' is disorganized and unproductive; his free-associative lectures feel more like an excuse to avoid preparing something to deliver to the class than 'threads' as he so artfully calls them. Instead of teaching, he serves up either a totally redundant rehearsal of the readings which adds nothing new to your understanding of them (not that there's much to get to begin with) or rattles off a bunch of vaguely related material in a manner which makes it all seem somehow even more totally irrelevant, with some anecdotes and fucking terrible jokes tossed in for piquancy . . The course requirements are as muddled as his lectures. I was delighted to learn two weeks before the end of the semester that the 'Hudson River Report' due at the last class was to be 25 pages long. .which is just a little outrageous for an intro class like this one--and he's been pretty cagey, when it comes down to it, about what exactly is supposed to be included in it. And then of course, there are all the annoying little quizzes and weekly tests that you can't make up without a pink slip from your dean, and the labs--one of which involved walking down to a playground and listening to our lab instructor read us a CHILDREN'S BOOK about a lighthouse. Oh no, I'm not kidding. Yeah the labs are pointless too. .reconstructing vole skeletons is pretty cool though. .and to her credit Diane is a really great lab instructor who did her best to represent on the students' behalf and whatnot, but evidently in vain since Bower doesn't seem to care about or listen to anyone but his own well-distended ego. . .but yeah, this class, if you dare take it, will just confound you with its shittiness, so don't do it unless you have to (god forbid). Really, it boggles the mind. Total waste of time and money, and totally inexcusable, really, as an offering at any accredited institution--and Bower is definitely the weak link here. The material is interesting, sure, but he kills it dead. HATE.\nWorkload:\nNothing difficult, but it's the sheer volume and the sheer inanity of it all. .About fifteen pounds of hand-out readings over the semester that you don't need to read, open-note weekly short tests that require you to copy the answer right from the text to get full credit, map work, stupid independent trip to the Met, stupid independent trip to the AMNH, laughable 25-page-'not including illustrations, maps, photos, and tables'-Hudson River Report, and a final which covers practically nothing discussed throughout the semester and which will apparently focus entirely on the book we've been reading for about a week now.\n"

Either that or he teaches about wildly unrelated subjects that are interesting on a whim, but add absolutely nothing to your general knowledge of science.

He hands out a billion handouts, most of which he never talks about, and most of which are completely off-topic.

This way was really the best way to fulfill the science requirement and i'm even considering majoring/minoring in env science.

He didn't hand out a syllabus at the beginning of the course and seemed to talk about whatever he wanted.  He handed out several pounds of handouts every class, most of which he never mentioned, much less taught the material. Assignments in lecture were ludicrous--two mandatory trips to the American Natural History Museum, where we spent 2-3 hours drawing pictures of red-backed voles and tracing maps of Alaska for no apparent reason. The end-of-term Hudson River lab report made kindergarten connect-the-dots look challenging. There is NO curriculum for this course. Labs included using colored pencils to color globes and food chains, dissecting owl pellets, and two trips to the river which consisted of walked to 125th Street and back. I would not recommend this class to anyone under any circumstances. I learned nothing, wasted six hours a week in lecture and lab, and have five inches worth of useless photocopies to show for it.\nWorkload:\nOne novel, weekly \"tests\" (open book; no material to test on), a final exam that includes drawing.

Every now and then you might learn something, or find something cool, but you mostly feel rancid and disgusted.  Whomever wrote the review proclaiming that \"Bower is power\" must be one of the students who got a little too friendly with this depressing beast of a professor (you may note that he no longer has office hours).  The lectures do sometimes cover interesting material, but are drained by Bower's mid-life-self-hatred and simultaneous/unremitting condescension.  By the way, the material is all based on divulging the myriad of ways in which we are going to die (chemical poisoning, pesticides, meteors, nukes, etc.) and on that consideration, I suppose Bower's lecture enthusiasm equals the optimism of the material.  I will concede, however, that students interested in psychology may find amusement in the psychoanalysis of Bower, which could very well be a case study, if not a class on its own.  The first semester of lab involves tracking groundwater contamination on a SimCity-esque computer game and plotting points on maps.  Second semester involves picking apart owl pellets, pasting mouse skeletons on construction paper, and yes, coloring a diagram to demonstrate your knowledge of the food chain.  If you passed the third grade, you will excell in these activities.  If you consider yourself even barely more intelligent than a fourth grader, you will want to be highly sedated before each lab section.  Overall, if you are looking for an easy class to complete your science requirement, then this class definitley offers that...that is, if you are willing to endure patronizing lectures and mind-numbing labs.  However, if you have a genuine desire to learn or be challenged, value your mental health and maybe even your parents' money, or simply prefer professors who can differentiate between daily life and a nightmare... take something else.\nWorkload:\nlight reading, periodic tests (often with notes/open book), labs sometimes require consciousness\n"

He basically spoonfeeds you everything you need to know in class.

Where he does prove himself exceptional is in pedagogical technique and his philosophy about teaching. If you want a professor who will go as far as it takes to make sure that you know whats going on, produce quality work, and take something valuable away from a class, I cannot recommend Bower highly enough. He goes the extra mile--literally--by driving the class on numerous field trips (occuring about every other week) to the Black Rock Forest or elsewhere in the region. Who wouldn't seize this opportunity to get out of the city, into the woods, and learn what people in this field are really doing by doing it with them. Bower is at least humble enough to let numerous others take the wheel as guest lecturers (who were all great, incidentally). The class was extremely fun, and a refreshing departure from the drudgery we normally must endure. If Bower actually thought that grades were meaningful, I'd give this course an A+...as it is, I'll just say: You're missing out if you don't take this class. \nWorkload:\nRelatively light--one large scientific report, 2 smaller papers, negligible amount of reading. But be prepared to go to every class--you and the Prof. will make each other suffer if you're not committed to it. Bower gives you every opportunity to do well, as he expects to read and comment on multiple drafts of your report. If you're all caught up on grades, snap out of it--You won't get any of your final-draft work returned to you unless it sucks.\n"

He organizes everything very carefully and tells you exactly what you have to know for every test. Going to museums to fill out packets can take FOREVER, but it's stil worth it. This is, by far, the easiest way to get through the science requirement, and you might even find yourself enjoying it. Lab is very easy first semester, almost everyone got an A. Second semester is a little tougher, but still very manageable. If you have any math ability at all then you will do fine in intro. As for the law class, there is a lot of tedious work which requires a long time in the law library and you won't really learn that much about the law, but it's not hard to get an A. Exams were relatively easy.\nWorkload:\nFor intro: very light, you don't even have to do all the reading (which isn't that much anyways.) For law: medium, more tedious than it is difficult. \n"

To show us what a subpoena looked like, he even brought in one that he got as mayor of \"a small town in New Jersey, \" which he mentioned every other second. But, bottom line, he is a really good teacher and is one of the most fair professors I have ever had. When preparing us for tests, he told us exactly what we needed to know, and there were never any surprises. We got to use \"cheat sheets\" frequently, which made things a lot less stressful. He clearly outlines what he expects from you, and you can even hand back tests and papers for reevaluation if you think there is a problem. Overall, although his ego is huge, he's a very nice guy and you will definitely do well, especially if he actually knows who you are (this is hard in intro, but the law class is smaller so he'll definitely know who you are!)!\nWorkload:\nIntro: a few tests (first semester we had small tests every week and a non-cumulative final, second semester we had 4 tests and the last one was a non-cumulative final).
