He encourages everyone to attempt the things they think they can't possibly do by always saying \"Sure, no problem. Easy.\"  Going to class is a pleasure.  You create the amount of work for yourself.  do as much or as little as you want, but do know that he notices.  A real asset to the department.\nWorkload:\nenough to fill every class time to the limit but little to no time outside of class.\n"
