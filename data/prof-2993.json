His knowledge of piano was outstanding itself, but he was also wonderful at using his skills to help vocalists improve.  He knew all of the concepts we dealt with in class and was able to help students use them to their advantage.  Moreover, he was ALWAYS available to meet for extra pratice.  I met with him at least once a week, someitmes more, and it was always fun and helpful.  If you are blessed from heaven with Jorge, make sure to use his services as much as possible.  Hip, Hip, Jorge! (Yankees fans should get that one)\n"
