            "review_content": "\nGonzales took over the second half of the course.  Her lectures were packed with information and she often went too quickly, ending class early.  This made it difficult to catch everything.  Also her tests were considerably more specific than the first professor's.  It is evident that she enjoys what she does and knows much about the material, but she does go a bit fast.  She will answer questions in class and via email, she is hard to find for office hours.  Overall, a good course, just difficult to stay on top of the material.\nWorkload:\n3 tests, 1 final\n"
