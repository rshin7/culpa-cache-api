            "review_content": "\nSvetlana was extremely helpful from start to finish. I wish I would have 'found' her earlier in my Columbia. I also wish she taught more classes. One of her big strengths was her ability to design such an effective course  - shows so much about who she is. She really knew the theory (covered in the first half). She has an amazing perspective for experimental design (taught in the second half). She really knows how to help cultivate a scientist's mind in others (taught throughout - how to write a great paper, discuss your research, respond to reviewers, get/give feedback to peers., etc.). There is so much I could mention. \nAll in all, A+ class: Lectures were clear and useful, readings were high value, we all got great feedback and support, Svetlana generated a lot of energy in the class, and excitement in the group.\nSummary: she is just amazing. She is such a nice person, caring, and really interested in hearing the students thoughts. She is always there for help, and really has a passion for the topic. I couldn't have asked for a better professor.\n\nWorkload:\nSimilar to any other seminar.It was nice that we had straightforward quizzes at the beginning of classes because they really solidified the information we read about in the papers.\n\n"
