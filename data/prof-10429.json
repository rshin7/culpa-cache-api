She was always very well-prepared, having went over all the assigning reading carefully to make sure she could explain whatever I had questions about.  She even responded promptly when I emailed her questions a few times before a paper was due or exam time, which really helped me out.  She went over a draft of my fourth paper, the longest of the four papers that was 20% of the class grade, and gave me a lot of comments to help with revision before I had to turn it in.  Although she didn't grade my papers since she wasn't officially my TA, I'm sure her paper comments for her actual students must have been equally helpful.  If you're ever in a class where she is one of the TAs, I definitely recommend requesting her!\n\nWorkload:\nFour papers, midterm, final.  \n"
