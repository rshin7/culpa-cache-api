Hui is willing to stay late to explain the subject for us, and is very patient with students.  During office hours he is knowledgeable and clear.  In my experience, Hui's grading of assignments has been meticulous, and assignments were returned in a timely fashion.  Hui seems to be doing well in all aspects of his TA responsibilities.\nWorkload:\nN/A--Hui was not responsible for this part of the course.\n"
