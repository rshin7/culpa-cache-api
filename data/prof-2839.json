She did not really expect us to do all the reading, but you could tell that she was kind of disappointed when the majority were unable to participate because they had not read. For those who read the majority of the books, her discussions are fast-paced and jam-packed with some REALLY interesting ideas. She is nice, she learns everyones' names, and she is not a real tough grader (you just need to get used to what she is looking for). She definately made this course worth-while! Oh, and a side note: it will be almost as exciting as a new episode of Sex and the City every time you walk in the room because she has such a unique and generally applaudable style!\nWorkload:\nNot her say...but I would imagine if she had the chance, she would want her students to do a bit more than the norm.\n"
