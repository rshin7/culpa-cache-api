His final is EASY.  Just show up to class on time, say a few things, and you're good.  Take him up on his offer to meet before essays since sometimes his prompts are a little unclear-he also gives great advice and genuinely wants his students to improve as writers.  He is laid back and just makes the course enjoyable.\nWorkload:\n3 essays (55%), Final (25%), Participation (20%)\n"
