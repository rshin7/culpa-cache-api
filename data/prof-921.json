Unfortunately, her thick  Czech accent sometimes muddies  comprehension, but on the whole,  the content and the readings are  interesting enough to balance out  this difficulty. She's not too stringent  about the readings and cares more  about understanding the material as  a whole rather than nitpicking with  specifics.\nWorkload:\nJournal entries on film viewings  (once a week), a mid-term and a final  paper (10 pages).\n"
