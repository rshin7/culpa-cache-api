There are very short memoirs in which she asks her students to write a short paper on. This might sound off-putting but the memoirs she chooses are fascinating. You will read through them in no time.

The professor herself is very knowledgeable and interesting, but spends half of every class going on some tandem story about a patient of hers (which may or may not be breaking patient confidentiality?), and she seems too busy overall to be teaching at this point in her life. Getting office hours appointments is harder than getting a cronut was last summer,but if you manage to get them (and she remembers to come), she will give you solid advice and is really helpful. Overall, Professor McCaskill is really smart and interesting, but too busy to be teaching this course. \nBecause she is kind of distracted and has other things going on, our TAs took the opportunity to be lazy and overall useless. Only two of them bothered showing up to class consistently and despite our tests being 60 multiple choice on a scantron and then 2-3 case studies, they took over a month to return both tests and were similarly derelect in their grading duties on the review_content. review_content sessions are not very helpful- they will only answer questions and half the answers to the questions are \"we're not sure,\" or \"what is chapter 16 on?,\" or \"wel'll have to ask the professor.\" They seem well meaning enough but it's pretty clear they are fairly disinterested. Their office hours are only slightly more helpful, they're not great at clarifying material.\nThe tests are really fair, as long as you go to class and memorize what the straightforward slide shows are, you'll do really well. There was a textbook but I never bought it and I ended up with an A. Overall, class is not a ton of work and fairly interesting, just frustrating in terms of TA apathy and how distracted the professor can be. \nWorkload:\nNormal- 2 midterms, 2 book revies, and a final. The reading is optional- I never bought the book and ended up with an A.\n"

She brought the class Halloween candy.\nI think I would have enjoyed taking a seminar class with her. A large lecture class is not the best way for her to shine. She uses the PPTs from the textbooks do her lectures. If you read the book, you know what's going to be on the test. She fell a bit behind on the syllabus, but no big deal. She is a bit disorganized, but it isn't too distracting.\nIt seems like she is a bit of a procrastinator. Her syllabus was not posted until class began, and review sheets, though promised well in advance, came out right around the day of threview_content. review_content sessions with the TA's were kind of a joke, but at least they existed. \nHer exams are moderate, with some questions that seemingly come out of left field. Keep up the readings and you will be fine.\nI would take another class with her, as long as it was a seminar.\nWorkload:\nLight.\n2 midterms, cumulative final: moderately difficult multiple choice with several case studies for you to diagnose as well. 2 memoir response papers for two interesting books. \n"

These studies are fascinating and really help you learn the disorders. \nShe also assigns memoirs of people who have suffered from various disorders that you \"review.\" She intends this to be primarily as a \"grade-booster\" (her words) but don't expect to get 100% if you write a boring paper. \nShe is a big fan of the DSM multi-axial diagnosis, so you will definitely learn to read a case study and make a full diagnosis. The multiple choice on her exams are moderately difficult. \nFor people who prefer extremely structured slideshows, this may not be the class for you. Professor McCaskill does have slideshows, but she prefers to tell case studies and brainstorm treatment options with the class. As someone interested in going into the field, I found this invaluable. \nA note: drug use and abuse does involve Neuroscience, so I would reccomend taking it after or while you take a neuro class. \nDon't expect an easy A (but don't expect to have to do a ton of work and still fail). I've found that if you put in the time, the A is yours. \nWorkload:\nNot too heavy. A midterm and a cumulative final for both classes, as well as 2/3 3-5 page book reviews. That's all! \n"

She has years of experience in the field, and she uses that experience to supplement every lecture. However, it sometimes felt like this course lacked direction. Professor McCaskill spent a lot of time focusing on her clinical experience, but the tests ended up really just being about the characteristics of the drugs and their effects, which I learned by reading the textbook the day before the final. All in all, it's not a difficult course. We don't cover that much material because McCaskill spends so much time talking about other things. She is interesting to listen to, though, and it's worth going to the lectures if you would like to hear about her experiences. Otherwise, you can get all the information from the lecture outlines and the textbook.\nWorkload:\nRead 4 memoirs throughout the semester and write a short response.

She loves what she does and is very knowledgeable, but sometimes (and I felt this way about Drug Use and Abuse, too) she does NOT emphasize enough the information that she actually wants us to know.  We'll spend class after class discussing the ethics of this treatment, or that drug, or the stigma surrounding kids with HIV or epilepsy, but when it comes down to what she actually wants us to KNOW for the final, she often expects us to know more neuropharm. than we ever discussed in class.\nShe does give us all of this information (usually at the end of the semester and in review sessions), but I always feel a bit cheated in this respect.  Otherwise, her classes are great.  Even though you may feel unprepared for a midterm/final, you should have no problem pulling off a good grade.  \nDespite her misgivings, she's a really wonderful teacher - a true breath of fresh air.\nWorkload:\nA midterm, 10-page paper (really easy, just write about a neurodevelopmental disorder), a final (which took about an hour), and LOTS of reading.  I didn't end up doing a lot of it (which was fine), but it's interesting and while it may be a heavy reading, she only ever wants us to read \"at the level of class discussion.\" Not too bad.

But that is not always a good thing. Sometimes we need a professor who is just going to put it out there during class and offer the more detailed one-on-one help outside of class.\nI thought the neuropharm was very interesting, but we probably spent about 4 class periods the entire semester learning straight neuropharm. The rest was an iffy discussion of addiction and psychology that most of us already knew from other courses and/or common sense. \nOverall probably not worth your time, unless you really like to read addiction memoirs and engage in somewhat useless lecture style discussion. Or you want to hang out with McCaskill, because that's definitely worth doing. \nWorkload:\nmidterm, final, three \"book club\" like meetings and response papers to those meetings, and a longer paper at the end of the semester about one of the memoirs. \n"

Because of this, however, she can spend entire class periods listening to what each one has to say on simple topics that could have been explained very quickly (Ex: One time a student asked \"Like, when I go to parties, why is is that I can drink so much more vodka than rum? It's like my body is just, like, tolerant to one and not the other?\" And instead of telling them that this is not the time or the place she allowed the whole class discussion to go on a huge tangent). Although it's clear that E'Mett knows what she is talking about, it seems hard for her to keep focused on the subject at hand. As a result, I went through this class feeling like I didn't know what I was supposed to be learning at all. Her class basically seems unncessary because it is a strange mixture of neuropharmacology and psychology that isn't neurpharmacological enough to give you a clear understanding of what is going on at the level of the neurotransmitters and not psychological enough to give you a clear understanding of what it means to be addicted to drugs. If you're interested in this topic, go to the internet, read a book, or ask a professor. But don't take this class. \nWorkload:\nRead 3 memoirs of addiction, meet with groups to discuss the book and write a very short response paper; a midterm and final that requires you to study the outlines she gives every class (Caution: If you understand the biology of neurons, you'll do fine; if not - you'll struggle); Also written final paper 6-10 pgs about \"what is addiction?\" Very easy\n"

I'm trying to study for the final exam right now and she actually put on an outline that opioids inhibit GABA by releasing NEURONS that normally tonically control dopamine. It's not like she doesn't know that that's wrong. She is just all over the place. I wish I had a stricter, harder teacher for this class because I don't feel like I have actually learned anything. Avoid any classes with her if you have taken any biology. She will only frustrate you.\nWorkload:\nIt's any easy class that ends up being more difficult because she sucks.

She is approachable and friendly. She is happy to talk about material that extends beyond what she covers in class.  \nShe gives you outlines -- I repeat -- she gives you OUTLINES of every topic that she covers, making it virtually unnecessary to take a ton of notes or do the reading. Although the outlines themselves could use a little cleaning up organization-wise, they were still priceless to the student who doesn't want to be forced to do a ton of work.  She does not take attendance. But unless you want to do the reading, I suggest going to class. \nDuring class, McCaskill sticks to the outlines. Perhaps due to her background in neurobiology/biopsychology, she explains biological processes very clearly, even to the point that a scientifically handicapped person like I am could understand them. With these and all concepts, she teaches you what you need to know, and she does it well. She takes time to answer questions in class, and she allows for discussion, which I found refreshing. \nI liked McCaskill very much, and I will take more of her classes.

Intro Psych is a course to be endured, regardless of your professor. It\u00c2\u2019s just boring.

Take notes during class, but take them on the outlines themselves. This is what I did after I figured it out. If you are the no-holds-barred straight-A's go-getter type, then you will do the readings, you will study for the tests in advance, and you WILL get an A. \nMcCaskill herself says this is possible, and it is.

In lecture, she would read straight from Powerpoint slides which were so poorly organized and incoherently written it often seemed she had not taken enough time to prepare.  She did not explain the often difficult terms and concepts on the slides-- she just read them, leaving us to try to decipher them later.  Reading the book was helpful sometimes, but she often contradicted what it said.  So studying for tests meant trying to make sense of her slides, memorizing lots of material I didn't fully understand, and trying to decide whether to follow the book or her.  Basically, this class took really interesting material and made it painful.  I got the impression that she didn't care if we understood anything-- she just wanted us to memorize it.

I probably would not take this class again if I had the choice. \nWorkload:\n2 mid-terms, 1 final (a bitch). \n"

            "review_content": "\n  I have had E'mett for 2 classes and if there were another one for me to take with her I would.  She is incredably passionate about neurobiology, especially with its respect to pediatric cases, and it shows.  Her lectures are interesting and interactive.  For Neuropharm, she has it such that every other meeting is taugh by members of the class.  In addition, she genuinely cares about her students.  She helped me out tremendously with my medical school apps and interview, and I am quite sure she has offered advice to several other students, as she herself is in medical school at moment.    Another thing I should mention is that E'mett cators to students at all levels of neurobiology.  I took both classes before taking Neuroscience and Behavior (a pre-rec) and had no problem with Neurodevelopmental, but felt I could have gotten a little more out of Neuropharm if I had taken the pre-rec (but still learned A LOT).  I would highly recommend any class that she teaches.  \nWorkload:\nFor Neurodevelopmental: I think there two midterms and a final, all with different formats...I think mostly essay, some short answer, and some multiple choice.\nFor Neuropharm: a midterm, a final, a class presentation based on an article review, and a final research paper of about 10 pages (I think)\nNOTE: some people say that she is an easy A, but I think it is more that she is straightforward and tells you exactly what you need to know.  If you listen to her when she tells you that something will be on your exam, you will do well in her class.\n"
