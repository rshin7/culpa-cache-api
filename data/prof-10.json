            "review_content": "\nAfter taking this class last semester, I'm surprised by how negative so many of these reviews have been. Marina Cords is a woman dedicated to her field and to this class. I found her lectures to be incredibly straightforward and clearly formatted. She readily made sure that all materials for the class were available online, and uploaded review packets before each test that were really helpful. She likes getting to know her students, so I highly recommend going to her office hours and just chatting with her. It'll probably up your grade in the class, and she might even be able to help you with research opportunities on campus. \nYes, there are lots of little assignments and tests/quizzes throughout the course. However, I felt like that kept me on top of the material and also gave me lots of chances to improve my grade. I thought the trip to the zoo with the class was a fantastic learning experience, in which we were able to apply our knowledge of primate behavior to the animals in front of us. My only negative comment about the class would be that sometimes I felt like time spent in discussion sections was wasted on watching outdated scientific videos, although some of them were entertaining and educational. \nOverall, I would recommend this course to any student interested in animal behavior. Marina Cords is a really smart woman and knows what she's doing when she teaches this material. \nWorkload:\nEasy weekly quizlets, weekly readings that aren't totally necessary to read, 2 \"midterms\", a final, and five written assignments usually consisting of answering a few questions. I never felt overwhelmed by the workload, but I did have to put actual effort into all of it.\n"

            "review_content": "\nDON'T DO IT.  This is probably top 3 worst classes I've taken at Columbia.  Unless you want to watch monkey fucking, the lectures are repetitive and dry.  The discussion sections have no content and are in no way helpful for the graded parts of the course.  In fact, they seem entirely unrelated.   This whole class is designed to waste your time.  The grading is arbitrary and the assignments are excessively anal.  The TAs are bitchy and judgmental and Cords is also unhelpful.  I've never gotten back such a condescending e-mail from a professor as when I wrote to her. Do psych instead.\nWorkload:\nThere are something like 20-25 individual assignments.  It feels like high school biology except the teacher sucks more.  None of the assignments take very long, but its a bunch of micro-managing, anal retentive bullshit to worry about over the course of a semester.\n"

            "review_content": "\nPros: Professor Cords is really, really nice and very approachable. She's a fantastic lecturer and her power points help the discussion stay on track, so long as you make sure that you either write quickly or have a laptop to type your notes on. Study guides for the two midterms and the final are located under \"Web Resources,\" which help a lot with studying for the exams. Also, the Lecture Reviews are really great and help with studying. The videos watched in Discussion were all really interesting, even though I'm not at all interested in monkeys. \nCons: The tests for this class are not easy at all or even in the middle, and the grading can be quite harsh. I personally completed all of the readings, completed the study guides, read the lecture reviews, and took great notes, but I still didn't do well on any of the exams. Realistically, the assigned readings aren't required for the tests and most of the material is available if you answer the study guides, read the lecture reviews, and go over your class notes, but remember that all of those equal up to be a LOT of things to memorize. Also, \"short answer\" isn't really short - prepare to have \"Explain more\" if you just write a concise sentence. \nOverall, I'd suggest this to students that have a decent science background already, rather than someone that is maybe a Literature major. I learned a lot about a subject I never would have learned about in detail, so I'm glad I chose this subject, but I wish I had spent less time reading the material and more time creating flash cards to just memorize basic facts.\nWorkload:\n5 assignments, weekly quizlets, 1 quiz at the beginning of the semester, 2 midterms, 1 final. Optional essay and trip to the zoo offered. Reading not incredibly dense and very enjoyable after you get through the first few chapters of the textbook, but they aren't important for your tests. \n"

Dr. Cords is very knowledgeable, and the TA was fantastic. Her lectures are very clear and easy to understand, and she always encourages questions, but it's true she's not really all that engaging. \nThe powerpoints are not available online. Instead, you get these lecture reviews that raise more questions than they answer. But if you go to class and take notes from the slides, you're fine. You do not need the textbook EVER. Discussion sections are always movies, so low-stress (could be interesting or boring, depending on your level of interest in the class). In general, this class is a fun way to learn about the lives of animals and fulfill the science requirement without too much stress!\nWorkload:\nFive assignments (three are very easy, two are really long and annoying, but not difficult). Two midterms that will go well as long as you went to class and you memorize your notes. You do not need to do the readings, they are never tested. Final is all multiple-choice, and pretty exhausting, but not impossible. \n"

Class is basically powerpoint lectures that are generally very dull, and instead of absorbing the material, you spend most of your time frantically copying the powerpoint slide before Professor Cords moves on. Discussion sections were equally as boring, we just watched movies of monkeys every single week.\nI did learn a lot about primate behavior now that I look back on the class, and some of it was interesting now, but the class was generally boring and not engaging and felt like a waste of time when I was taking it.\nThe readings are useless, I didn't do any of them and did fine on exams. The grading is a bit funny, especially for assignments (I felt like the grader was looking for very specific things in assignments and on exams).\nSo overall, the course wasn't horrible, but it could have been a lot better.\nWorkload:\nBasically nonexistent on a week to week basis. Readings that aren't necessary. Mandatory discussion sections (all you do is watch a film). 5 small assignments throughout the semester. Weekly easy quizlets in class. Two midterms and a final. Also, there is an extra credit zoo assignment that was fun.\n"

Although she doesn't post the PowerPoints online, she does post very helpful \"lecture reviews\" that go over the important points from the lectures.\nWorkload:\nThree multiple choice exams, weekly quizzes (very easy).

However, the best analogy I can give is this: Imagine cramming what seems like years worth of information into one semester and being expected to account for every bit of it on the exams. \nThis professor is the strictest grader I've ever had at Columbia. This in the only class that I have ever gotten less than a B on any of the work, and trust me, I am not a slacker when it comes to studying. Yes, the reading is very reasonable, and the lectures are moderately interesting. Yet, the quizzes and the exams are completely harsh and she takes points off for every little bit of info that you may have left out in struggling to answer her questions in her words, word for word.\nShe made a comment during the first class on the decrease in students who sign up for her course and blames it on the Frontiers of Science course that has recently been offered as an alternative option for satisfying the Science Requirement. Yet, I believe that the stringency of her grading and her harsh exam technique may have something to do with the sudden drop in registration. \nAlas, although this was an interesting course, the Frontiers of Science sounds like the better option. I've heard it's challenging as well, but it's worth 4 points, so the extra work may actually seem worth it.\nWorkload:\nLight reading, no required papers (although the extra-credit assignments seem necessary judging her strict grading methods. on the tests)  Multiple choice quizzes which are comprised of trick questions that make you wrack you brain unnecessarily. \n"

They know less about monkeys than I do, which is saying something.  They tried to help, but when they're reading the stuff along with you, they can't answer any real questions, and are completely unhelpful.  I talked to my friend who'd taken the class last year, and she was more helpful.  Get a clue E3B: use undergrad TAs, or get a lot more grad students interested in monkey sex.  You're doing a disservice to the students otherwise.\nWorkload:\nTwo identical quizzes, midterm and final (it nearly made me cry it was so hard).

The lectures are incredibly well organized, but not entirely necessary to go to since you can get pretty thorough class notes on her website. The tests require you to regurgitate information from the lectures. Don't stray too far or (gasp!) put it in your own words because you will probably be counted off. The TAs require very complete questions and love taking off because you neglected to include all possible answers. The readings are pretty worthless because there is usually only one or two questions over the readings on each test.  I would recommend checking over your test both before turning it in and after the grades come back. The TAs screwed up calculating my total score on each of the three \"midterms\" (an error ranging from 3 to 11 points).\nWorkload:\nlight reading, 3 midterms, 1 multiple choice final\n"

Everything is on the web, though, so you really don't have to.
