            "review_content": "\nProf Connor's class was very enjoyable. The field of Translation Studies is very new but he still manages to raise interesting issues throughout the semester. That being said I felt the class was kind of wishy-washy. I enjoyed it and thought it was a great class, and I don't regret taking it, but that being said, if you're looking for more practical, hands-on application, you might be a bit disappointed with this course. There is only one required translation assignment, though it is an option for the final. Given that it's a large lecture (100+ students) with only four TAs, it makes sense that there aren't many assignments. \nThe lectures are often just Professor Connor discussing what he thought was important, and him trying (and sometimes failing) to solicit class participation. Sometimes certain readings were never discussed at all, though it is usually helpful to read them. Usually every week we'll have three or four readings (no more than 20 pages, usually they're very short) and Professor Connor will pick one or two and extensively discuss them. You may nor may not appreciate this approach. \nEven though Professor Connor runs a great class about an interesting topic, I felt his lecture style is pretty standard for a college course. His lectures aren't fabulously engaging though they are very informative. He tries his best to engage with students but he is very much the stereotypical \"ivory tower\" academic, and it comes across in his class. Most of what we do is dedicated to theory though I suppose his spring seminar on translation would be more dedicated to practice. I haven't taken it though, so I can't comment. \nAll that being said he genuinely cares about us and he wants to see us do well. He calls us all aspiring translators (which I guess we are) and always has nice things to say about us, just for taking the class. He wants us to learn, and he seems to enjoy teaching, which is more than you can say for other professors at Barnard or Columbia. So all that said, if you have fulfilled the language requirement, you should definitely take this class. It is a very fun class in a subject that everyone is interested about since it really is everywhere nowadays. \nMy TA was Valeria Luiselli. I am very glad to have been able to get her comments on my work. She was very approachable by email and after class, and very knowledgeable about the course material. She would also participate in the lecture with relevant information. All you could want from a TA. The other TAs were equally helpful, from what I could tell. \n\nWorkload:\nParticipation and pop quizzes (15%) -- the easiest things ever. I felt the quizzes were more to ensure attendance than to ensure comprehension. We also had to post questions for guest speakers, which factored into the grade. There is an attendance policy (max two unexcused absences) though it is hardly ever taken. \nLanguage memoir (20%) -- very simple story about your bilingualism and how it developed. It's a very creative assignment, around 4 pages. \nTranslation (20%) and Peer-Critique (10%) -- also simple. You pick a source text, which is about a page, and you translate it. You then send it to your partner and they critique it, and you critique theirs. You can pretty much pick any prose from the 20th century. \nFinal Project (35%) -- 7-10 pages. You get to select from five prompts, and one of them is a translation project (which I did). You translate four pages of source material, and you can pick almost anything, even a poem. You then translate it and write prefatory notes. Altogether it came out to about nine pages. Other topics included: 1) discussion of community interpreting or subtitling/dubbing; 2) translation critique; 3) essay about a play (Brian Friel's Translations); or 4) an interview with a translator. \n"

His class completely changed my world view and made me rethink a lot of what I wanted to get out of college.  I have never enjoyed a final paper as much as I enjoyed the one for this class.  While he is very Francophone oriented, there are many languages represented in the class and he appreciates and highlights that.  \nWorkload:\nThere is a partner translation project, a translation memoir and a final project (10 pgs).  There is also weekly reading which is usually a couple of articles.  It's very manageable.  You can put in as much effort as you want.\n"

            "review_content": "\nThe best thing I can recommend is going to office hours; he does have a tendency to drone sometimes (in 20th Century French Literature, for sure), but the material he presents to you is engaging enough that it merits more conversation. You'll want to talk about these things, you'll want to think about them. He's also a funny guy and good to get to know. His office hours (when he remembers that he has them, I suppose) are very instructive, and I get the idea that he likes talking to his students more than reading them. Here he can explain why he doesn't explicitly advocate for the \"faithful\" translations or too \"foreignizing\" translations...(hint: can be the same thing). Professor Connor doesn't like grading papers. He leaves grading them, and assigning them, to the last minute. You want to know how you did in the class? Don't worry about it, you probably didn't get anything near a B. But if you don't want to do any work in the class, it's your loss, you're not learning anything he's teaching, which is actually pretty interesting. But at least if you don't show up and don't do your reading, go out and do something better with your time than laying in bed with your computer. At least in Translation Studies, the only way to really understand the material is if you start translating yourself. \nGrading:\nTranslations/commentary: 25%\nWritten critique/appreciation of a peer translation: 15%\nMidterm: 20%\nClass participation: 15%\nFinal project: 25%\nBooks (at CU Bookstore):\nLawrence Venuti (ed.), The Translation Studies Reader (2nd ed. 2004)\nBrian Friel, Translations\nAdditional texts made available through Courseworks\nWeek I (6 and 8 September)\nIn the beginning\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \n*Genesis 11 : 1-9 (Tower of Babel)\n*Lawrence Venuti, \"How to Read an Translation\"\n*Hugo Friedrich, \"On the Art of Translation\"\nFriedrich Nietzsche, \"Translations\"\nFriedrich Nietzsche, \"On the Problem of Translation\"\nRoman Jakobson, \"On Linguistic Aspects of Translation\"\nWeek II  (13 and 15 September)\nSome basic concepts\nJ.

            "review_content": "\nTo sum up this review, this class really disappointed me. I love languages, enjoy translation, and had high hopes. It's not challenging and it's the only class that I've ever skipped or nodded off in. STAY AWAY. (If you like languages, take Intro to Linguistics instead -- it's the exact opposite of this class. It's engaging, challenging, and super interesting. Don't make the mistake of taking this class.)\nThe first class you learn the following:\n - translation is about decisions that have consequences\n - that you can translate towards or away from a culture\n - that Prof. Connor's teaching style involves lecturing in a slow, droning voice with little discussion\nI don't deny that Prof Connor is a nice guy, but the rest of the semester is spent repeating point (a) and (b) in various different ways. I kid you not, there is no need for you to come to class or do any reading whatsoever. Prof. Connor's lectures entirely involve repeating the reading, so you under on circumstance would ever HAVE to do both reading and showing up. The readings are often beautifully written, but dense and take forever to get to the point.\nPart of the problem of why this course is so soporific is that the field of Translation Studies is tiny and underdeveloped, so it's not exactly a subject you can go out and explore yourself. There's also little conflict in the field -- a lot of the reading just agrees with itself. The thing is that in places where there is disagreement, Prof Connor's provides readings that support one point of view, or suggests that he doesn't know which is the right answer, despite clearly supporting one view point during his lecture.\nThis class is advantageous in that it provides:\n - an easy A\n - 3 free credits\n - an opportunity for freshmen to learn that certain classes can be skipped\n - a job interview talking point if you intend to do translation work (which pays really poorly, I might add, so it had better be a labor of love if you want to get involved in it)\nOne final point. Do NOT confuse this class for an opportunity to improve your language ability. If you are perfectly bilingual, yes, you will have an advantage because you will produce better quality translations. If you suck at your second language, the sad thing is that you still have a very good chance at an A. For a translation class, you're not actually graded on your ability to translate at all.\nWorkload:\nReading is 100% optional.\nThe essays are a breeze. Grading is silly easy. I remember that when the TA was returning the second essay, mine was near the bottom and she had to flip through nearly the whole stack. The lowest grade was a B+.\n"

Yes, he does come off as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stereotypical Ivy League professor\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with his sarcasm and entertaining but calm lectures. However, I found that his interest in Translation Studies and his love for French made him more than just a stereotypical professor. I would recommend his class 100% if the subject of Translation Studies interests you or if you are a devotee of the French language. \nProfessor Connor tries to allow everyone to participate; he also tries not to monopolize the lecture. His class is very stress-free and thus allows you to focus more on translation studies.\n\n\nWorkload:\nThere was a fair amount of reading. You could get away with not reading all the articles and excerpts, but they are really interesting. Other than that, we had one midterm examination (take-home essay) and a final project. Professor Connor always gives out many topics to choose from. He is very understanding if you have too much work to do and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn something in time (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exaggerate, though.)\nJust show up to class and participate.\n"

I suppose you don't really have to do any of the readings in either class, but I did most of them and other people seemed to as well; they're interesting and people want to be in his classes (especially Translation Studies), so it works out.  He speaks really quietly so it's easy to space out/fall asleep during class, but in addition to knowing about lots of dense readings and complicated literary things he's also quite funny and if you drift off you'll miss some really interesting, entertaining things.\nWorkload:\nmedium amount, but you don't have to do all of it all the time...probably two papers, but he tends to forget about the syllabus and make changes (lighter workload) as the semester goes along \n"

            "review_content": "\nIntro. to Translation Studies was a new course this semester and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get a very necessary theoretical foundation in translation (and get some feedback for your translations!). \nThe first half of the semester is all about different theories of translation. Professor Connor assigns great (and generally speedy) readings and then lectures on them in class. His lectures involve going over the reading (he really loves picking apart the text and doing little fascinating tangents) and then provoking a discussion. He covers everything, so even if it seems like he's just freely thinking and sharing ideas, he is getting his material across. You learn a lot and it's really, really painless.\nAfter the first half, you do a short translation assignment. The second half is all about practical application. There's interpreting, Oulipian translation, translating children's literature (which supposedly is being moved to the front of the syllabus next fall), and a whole array of other topics. Lots of fun topics. \nThere were also three speakers (one on art and translation, one on translating poetry, and one on interpreting). Basically, if students told Professor Connor they wanted a certain type of speaker, he found them. \nOverall, this is a great class that attracts fantastic multilingual people. Professor Connor is not your typical ivy league professor who uses a large workload as a substitute for actual, applied learning. He understands that learning is about exposing students to theories, letting them interact with these ideas, and leaving an impression.. not about endless busywork. I would absolutely recommend taking this class and taking it with Professor Connor. \nWorkload:\nReadings for every lecture, but they're well-chosen and fairly light. You won't be penalized for skimming but they're worth reading. Short translation (1-2 pages, plus 2 page commentary) and a final project. The final project was a choice of a long translation (4-5 pages, 5-7 pages commentary), an analysis of a translation, or another choice I can't recall at the moment. Very manageable, easy grading. \n"

Overall a great class and a great professor.\nWorkload:\nVery light. You'll feel clueless if you you don't do the readings,of course, but it's not like you're completely screwed- he explains them and doesn't call on people who don't want to speak. He hates grading papers, so we just had one short one, one long one, and an open-book (but not open-note) final, instead of the 4 papers it said we'd have on the syllabus.
