He has a background in quantum mechanics, so if you don't know much about physics, a lot of stuff in his lectures won't make sense. Also, he's just not great at explaining things clearly to a group of undergrads. The lectures are not great. He presents a single problem, asks the class for possible responses, tears their answers apart, and eventually moves on without providing an answer at all. Each problem would take about 4 classes to get through. This got boring and frustrating. I realize that the problems he presents don't have perfect answers, but it would have been nice to at least look at what modern philosophers have to say about them. There were 3 essays. He only counted 2 of them for the final grade. The grading was VERY arbitrary with the TAs grading some, Albert grading some, there was no consistency. Also, he let you write about anything from the course, which was sort of annoying because he pretty much had already demolished all of the class' ideas on the subjects in class.\nWould not recommend.\nWorkload:\nweekly readings\n3 essays (2 of which counted to the final grade)\ngrading was very inconsistent\n"

I took the Barnard equivalent of Methods and Problems, and while it was good, I appreciated that Albert took a less structured approach. Instead of reading out of a text book, it felt more like we were getting the chance to discuss philosophical issues with a really, really intelligent man. I would highly recommend taking the course with him, and YouTubing some of his talks because he always has something interesting to say. That said, if you have thin skin or aren't used to being criticized, exercise caution! I didn't find Albert unfriendly, but I know that some people in our class were a little offended by his mannerisms. \nWorkload:\nPretty typical of an introductory course--4 papers\n"

            "review_content": "\nVery challenging, thought-provoking, fun class. Should be called \"Intro to Philosophy of Science.\"\nProfessor Albert is a world-renowned physicist, who basically sauntered into a philosophy department at some point and has no reservations about slipping into quantum and statistical mechanics at a brisk pace, nearly every class. That said, the guy is incredibly smart and funny, approachable, and seems to genuinely care about \"doing philosophy,\" rather than simply memorizing thinkers and their own ideas. So you can expect each class to be introduced to a very complex philosophic problem, then get pointed toward readings in order to supplement and expand the discussion. So, if you miss a lecture, you better go to office hours, or have a good friend in the class to bring you up to speed. The Professor has office hours regularly, and is very good about breaking problems down and re-explaining material. As well, he'll give you more sources to scour, or topic ideas for assignments. And if you're bored, you can check him out on YouTube, or in the New York Times. Word of caution: if you think you're well-versed in philosophy and are looking for an easy A, this is NOT the class. Professor Albert has no reservations about the Socratic method, and you will leave each class stunned by the material. Topics covered include Causal Closure Physicalism, Aesthetics, Time Travel (awesome), Probability, Laws of Nature, Philosophy of Mind, Ontology, Poetry, Ethics, and Physics. \nWorkload:\nThree short papers, lots of fun reading. Fair grading. \n"

For non-philosophy majors, I especially recommend methods & problems. \nProfessor Albert is the epitome of what a philosophy professor should be, namely, deeply disillusioning. If you let him, he will leave you more puzzled than when you began. His lecture style is very Socratic. He is not interested in giving you answers for free and will make you work for them. Maybe this is what rubs people the wrong way, but isn't this why we came to Columbia in the first place? To be forced to critically examine our worldview and, if necessary, uproots those pieces that do not stand up against such examination? And when he finally does offer his two cents, he does so in the clearest, most colloquial way, so as to make the typical philosopher blush. His ability to translate extremely complex and abstract issues into layman's terms is a rare gift in this field. In so doing, he is able to make philosophy extremely accessible, which is why I, again, recommend methods & problems to all non-philosophy majors. \nWorkload:\nMethods and Problems: 3 papers on a topic of your choice\nDirection of Time: His book, Time and Chance, which serves as the sort of textbook for the course, a few supplementary readings, and a final exam.\n"

Professor Albert teaches as though the whole room has already taken linear algebra and basic quantum mechanics, and only 5 people really seem to understand consistently what's going on in the class. The lack of syllabus and sporatic readings make it very difficult to prepare for the class (short of reading his whole book, which is really just a typed-out version of his lectures). This class would be greatly improved if there were pre-requisites, or if Professor Albert spent the first three weeks, instead of jumping into the linear algebra and quantum mechanics, teaching linear algebra. \nThis is not a class for run-of-the-mill philosophy students--it's for science majors and astrophysicists.\nWorkload:\nVirtually none, except in the first few weeks there are two short homeworks that make no sense and everyone gets help. The midterm is a regurgitation of the homeworks, but, because everyone got help/googled/begged someone to do the hw for them, 1/3 of the class got between a 15-20/20, 1/3 of the class got between 10-15, and the last THIRD of the class got below a 10. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI think David Albert is a wonderful professor. I understand why people might get annoyed with him - he is a strange man with an odd style of speaking and, yes, sometimes a \"goofy grin\" on his face, lopes around the room with a similarly goofy slouch and sits with his feet up on his desk (if he's not sitting cross-legged on top of his desk). But I came to understand these things not as an indication of carelessness, or not wanting to be teaching, as another reviewer suggested, but of a truly free spirited teacher who cares not so much about the presentation of his ideas as much as the consistency of the ideas themselves. This could have been a problem in a more-lecture based class in which we had a limited time to learn certain points, but the format of our class was an open-ended one in which this attitude was ultimately very effective. Often times it took a long time - an entire class period or more - for even a basic bit of clarity to emerge, but when it did, I often found myself marveling at the incredible reasoning powers of Professor Albert. His method, in which he basically fields questions and suggestions from the class and systematically rejects almost all of them, can be extremely grueling and exasperating, but at the end of the day, I always found that my exasperation arose not from dissatisfaction with him but with a dissatisfaction in my own ability to reason things out in a logically consistent way. Looking back now, I recognize that I was in the throes of some real - and quite wonderful - intellectual bewilderment, which, in fact, was one of Albert's stated goals for the class. He wants to create a confusion in which students find their beliefs and reasoning skills deeply undermined; a confusion out of which we had to climb on our own, piecing bits of logic together for ourselves rather than having them told to us. I think that if people are patient, they will find that his class discussions lead to profound and extremely rigorous conclusions--or, if not conclusions per se, highly honest evaluations of our current state of understanding of a topic. \nThere were certainly times when his incessant interruptions became frustrating - especially when our T.A. would try to join the discussion. But he would often recognize that he was being too harsh and apologize for it. \nSome parts of the semester were presented more clearly than others - I personally found Albert's statements in our discussions of Philosophy of Mind to be especially puzzling and unsatisfying. \nBut this was the first time he had taught Methods and Problems, and when, on the last day of class he let us voice our overall opinions of the class and his teaching, I think he took our feedback to heart.\nSomething else I noticed about Albert is that he is a somewhat rigid thinker. I don't mean this in the sense that he is closed-minded; rather, it seems to me that he has found certain ways of explaining things and largely sticks to those ways of explaining them. I watched a video interview of him, in which his arguments, statements, metaphors, etc. were often word-for-word identical to things he had said in class. But this isn't a complaint- I think that he uses these certain explanations because they really work and communicate his ideas in a clean and direct way. Many of the points he made in class, and indeed his style of speaking and reasoning as a whole, has had a powerful and lasting impact on me. \nOverall, my opinion of Albert is that he is an extremely genuine man and a brilliant thinker who will turn you into a more rational person if you let him.\nWorkload:\nTwo medium-length papers and a 10 page final paper. Fairly graded, on the easy side I'd say. Final grade entirely determined by the essays.\nDoing the few readings helped for class discussions and essay writing.\nThe most important thing is to focus during class and follow the logic of the arguments being made. If you don't, you will have a hard time making a good argument in your paper.\n\n"

I did not want to take philosophy of science and had no interest in the topic, but it was a requirement for my major. Nevertheless, I left Albert's class with a completely different view of science and a profound appreciation for the subject. At the beginning of the semester, Prof. Albert told the class, \"You know you are in a good philosophy class if you leave the class more confused than when you came in.\" I left Albert's class absolutely more confused than I had come in, but the reason for my confusion was due to a radical confrontation of previously unexamined ideas I had about science and the way we experience the world. If you are the type of person who doesn't like going to class. If you want to be spoon-fed equations and procedures and take plug-n'-chug style exams, don't take Albert's class. You won't get anything out of it. On the other hand, if you are willing to take new material seriously and aren't afraid of a real philosophy class, jump on this opportunity. Prof. Albert's teaching style is unconventional. He is less concerned about participation points, homework, and exams than he is about the material itself. He is an expert in his field, and if you approach this class with due respect, you won't regret taking it.

While Alberts does not fall in the former, he is definitely below mediocre and subpar.  Bottom line: He simply doesn't care about teaching.  It is obvious that this is a chore for him, and one which he does with the greatest detachment from his students.  He didn't create a syllabi, stick to any coherent plan of lecture, rambled while seated well over 95% of the time without ever writing on the board, and used a horribly written, largely unreadable text, which he himself authored: Time and Chance.  In addition, as if this were not bad enough, he would never give details about grading, announcing late into the semester that either a single final exam or a 25 page paper would be the sole determination of grading.  He never ever responded to any emails, and would become visibly irritated with any questions after class, instructing people to email him, which again he never would respond to and use the common excuse to all of never having received any email.  I am not impressed by this so-call \"professor's\" brillance.  Where is it?  What has he done to genuinely earn this distinction?  Has he solved any outstanding problem in either physics or philosophy?  No.  Has he achieved an academic performance and excellence in teaching that would be the envy of his peers?  No.  People have mistaken confusion with the notion that somehow Alberts is on a level beyond ordinary men and women--a notion that was held by those majoring in the soft-sceinces like philosophy.  No science major thought this, as Alberts routinely failed to convey simply what were often very simple concepts.  Not once did Alberts even write a single equation on the board!  How can you discuss the philosophy of science without the language of science?: Math!  This was among one of only two regretable classes I ever took as an undergrad, the second being a mandatory English class that was turned into the soap box of a ranting, pretentous, jaded, so-called \"feminist\" English lecturer who saw misogyny in ever passage of male-written literature.  How I would love to have them both dungeoned together, lecturing to one another until both have gone totally mad.  Apparently, however, if one is only partially mad, that is still acceptable for the purposes of worthless lecturing to undergraduate, so long as tuition is fully paid that is.\nAvoid this charlaton parading as an academic.

Although the structure is very loose and the attendance seemingly inconsequential to your grade, if you go and listen to this man, the world just gets a little bit prettier. He does tend to interrupt students incessantly, but this is countered by his tendency to support your ideas and encourage your thinking like few other professors i've had here.  You may find yourself dozing off once in a while, since he can sound a bit droning, but it usually has more to do with the two hours of sleep you got last night and less to do with the content of his lecture.

I'll grant that it takes a little while to get used to the way he runs class discussions.  Essentially, he presents a problem to the class, asks for ideas or responses, and then argues vehemently against anything a student says.  The trick is not to take this personally.  That's just the way he discusses things - by debating them.  If the student has a valid point and sticks up for it, he'll acknowledge that it's interesting and continue to explore it by arguing against it.  If the student doesn't have a valid point, then he'll explain why in the course of shooting it down.\nPhilosophy of Science requires little or no background in either philosophy or science.  The readings are mainly from an anthology of papers; their relevance to the class discussion varies.  \nPhysics and Philosophy, strictly speaking, doesn't require a background in philosophy or science either.  However, it is necessary in the course of the class to learn a fair bit of linear algebra; the course will probably not appeal to those phobic of math.  The text is Albert's book.  His writing is a bit unusual; he has a tendency toward very long, very complex sentences.

He was always very supportive/encouraging and kept telling me I could do the math involved when I visited his office hours whining about how I couldn't understand the formalism.  His high level of support, so rare in CU professors (especially the brilliant, well-known ones), was what kept me in the class, despite it probably having been a better decision to drop it.  That said, I was at a complete disadvantage as far as background prep goes (there's a reason the vast majority of students were either math or physics grads or undergrads), but nevertheless, I'm very happy, now that the semester is over, that I took the course because I feel like I now finally have a reasonable understanding of quantum mechanics and it'll help me tremendously in future studies (whether on my own or in a class).  Besides his sincere support, Albert's teaching style was extremely refreshing.  He was always very relaxed and he displayed no pretentious, better-than-thou attitude.  He treated us more like colleagues than his students.  He would sit with his feet on the desk or wander around the classroom sitting on the deskchairs.  He wanted us to voice our opinions or questions, and even though he mostly shot down everything we came up with, he did it in a tactful, explanatory way which made sense later when we learned more--although at the end of the semester, it was more his opinion (instead of fact) versus ours on certain topics but of course, he's studied the stuff for eons so he naturally has a better supporting argument than we do but nevertheless, I'd encourage any student to pursue studying your own ideas that you find more interesting than Albert's conclusions.   If you plan on or are taking the class, please note the following:  I really didn't understand what the objective of the course was until towards the middle of the semester, so here's the scoop on what happens:  First, the only book required is his book and he lectures almost word for word from it in the exact same sequence as the book.  Hence the reason that he says the syllabus is the chapters of the book.  Second, the only thing you discuss is quantum mechanics so the course should really be called QM and Philosophy instead of Physics and Philosophy.  Third, if you haven't had a minimum of high school physics and calculus, you'll probably find the course much more challenging (at least I did anyway; Albert says you only need a high school background to understand the course, that it's self-contained, but stupid me, I took it anyway, forgetting that I had never taken physics and calc in high school and had done very poorly on the intro classes I took in college).  Last, if you're having difficulty understanding stuff from Albert's book, get some books that explain QM theory in more elementary layman's terms.  It helps a ton; I wish I would've done that from the very beginning instead of waiting until the end of the semester.  \nWorkload:\n1 in-class midterm (depending on how well Albert thinks the class understands the mathematical formalism; if he gives a midterm, it'll only be 1 or 2 problem sets).  1 final 15-20 page paper (believe me, you'll need more pages than that to write a really good paper).\n"

Tough for someone like myself who knows little physics or math, but not impossible. I was totally lost during most of class yet I aced the extremely easy midterm (that most others somehow failed) and I had plenty to write about on the final paper.\nAlbert might be a worldwide-expert philosopher of physics, but that has its drawbacks. He puts no time into teaching except for the class period itself (for which he was generally five to ten minutes late) and the office hours--not even enough time to make a syllabus, assign homework, or type up a description of the final paper. Albert has no interest in you personally, what your name is, or how you're doing in the class.\nAs for his lecturing, Albert seems to think that if he is just pedantic and repetitive enough, anyone will be able to understand every advanced detail about a field of science that couldn't even be conceived of until the twentieth century and that still makes no sense. You won't feel prepared to write the final paper and he won't give you much help, but it will be the only way that you really learn anything from the class.\nWorkload:\nYou have to read a short book that Albert wrote and recites almost verbatim in class; extremely easy midterm on technical stuff that most people somehow failed (they were assigned a make-up take-home exam); a 15-20 page research paper\n"

Professor Albert is a terrible lecturer who lets questions from students, valid or not, drive the entire lecture. This and the repetetive nature of the class made it a daily fight not to skip. He also focuses on details of little or no importance and skates right over those that are critical.\nThe midterm is completely unrepresentative of the substance of the class, and his examples are exactly out of the book (which he wrote) so you never get a clearer picture by asking him to explain. Unless you are extremely well versed in Physics, Philosophy, or both, you will get below a B- in this class. There is no homework to prepare you for the math-based take home midterm, and recitation is at a time that made it impossible (at least when I took it) for an observant Jew to attend.\nI learned more in researching for the final paper than I did from the entire class. I also felt like Professor Albert focused almost entirely on the Physics aspect and not at all on the Philosophy. I would have liked to see more exploration of what the discoveries meant for contemporary Philosophy, rather than just seeing the experiments and learning that they caused questions.\nWorkload:\nA take-home midterm based on the first half of the class, which nominally explains the math involved, and a 15-page final paper.\n"

He's an engaging lecturer, but his writing style is rough (and he uses his own book as the course's text) and he is pretty dismissive of any philosophical stance that is not copacetic with his tacit scientific realism.  Nice guy, but his uncommon blend --  too technical for a philosopher, too hands-off for a scientist -- can make him a frustration to both camps.  \nWorkload:\nOne midterm take home short answer test and one final paper (~15 pages).\n"

There were several topics that we spent a copious amount of time on and on others we barely skimmed the surface.  Prof. Albert can get a class discussion (which in my class consisted of abut 8 out of 40 people) started pretty well, however he cannot adequately lead the class in the right direction and we often got off on tangents.  To Prof. Albert's credit however, the topics of philosophy of science are in many cases inextricably connected, which makes it very difficult to confine discussion to only the philosophical problem at hand.  But, nonetheless, that is his job, is it not?  Overall, I would say this class is worth taking, but don't expect it to be your favorite.\nWorkload:\nA considerable amount of reading each week (which honestly you do not have to do at all).  The final paper (17-20 pages) is the only grade that you have, though he very timidly threatened to give a midterm.  An obvious, though extremely useful, bit of advice:  start early!  You will be kicking yourself big time if you do not.  In order to write a paper that will give you a decent grade you are going to have to do a fair amount of outside reading on your chosen subject and put some real thought into your arguments.\n"

Unfortunately, I was in the 6th grade section, the one that sets the clock ahead ten minutes when he's not looking, so the class didn't work as well as it should have. He has a really extensive knowledge of all the books and is a genuinely nice guy. He won't make you talk if you don't want to, and he doesn't give a participation grade, so if you're quiet or don't read, no worries. He's a really interesting person and has an unusual way of speaking, and likes the expression \"Bananas!\" Also, he says \"dat\" instead of \"that\" and his hair is a fiasco every single class period. He's entertaining at the very least. I wish people would be nicer to him because he's great and he's always nice to us, even when we're shitty.\nWorkload:\n1-page analysis of 2 passages of your choosing for each book, one midterm (a bitch---this is where his philosophy background shines through, leaving us in the dust), one 7-page paper (he'll probably do more once he gets more organized) and the standard final.

            "review_content": "\n        As you can tell from the amount of courses I've taken with him, I like Professor Albert.  However, of the three I consider only Physics and Philosophy to be exceptional.  Philosophy of Science is very good too but Direction of Time is disorganized, confused, and very weak overall....\n       Physics and Philosophy deals with various interpretations of quantum mechanics, some of their mind-boggling consequences, and how they bear on certain metaphysical doctrines, e.g., determinism and indeterminism, materialism.  In addition to the fascinating subject matter, the appeal of the course lies largely in its accessibility: no background in physics or math is presupposed in lectures or in Albert's book--the only text for the course.  As you long as you\u00c2\u2019re willing to work a bit on the necessary technical/formal stuff, even if  you are a non-science major (I am), you will be able to understand quantum mechanics in a general but sophisticated way.  It's one of the best classes I've taken.  The only assignment was a paper, due at the end of the semester, of approximately 20 pages.  You can get away with something a bit shorter....\n        Philosophy of Science also had only one requirement, a 15 pager.  The course is a good introduction to the field and you explore interesting issues, e.g., how to interpret scientific theories, realism, scientific explanation, objectivity.  Albert was irresponsible about putting photocopies on reserve.  In fact, the syllabus was generally vague and you did not have to do any reading because he didn't talk about the readings in class nor did he test us on them.  He sort of just lectured on the subjects--if you were interested you could do the reading.  Despite his sometimes surprising nonchalance learned a lot in the course and found his lectures interesting.....\n        Direction of Time is a different story.  The only text used was Albert's own book about the conflict between the time asymmetry of thermodynamics (and our everyday lives) and fundamental physical theories.  It is a confusing book and, unlike his book on quantum mechanics, poorly written.  For one thing, he goes parenthesis crazy.  In addition to his stylistic unclearness, the structure is awkward.  He makes the problems more complicated than they have to be and the class mirrors the confusing progression of the book.  I don't know if there are better, non-overly-technical books/articles on the subject, but if there are I wish he had assigned them.  Further, after I finally deciphered his main points I wondered why there was a whole course devoted to them: they're few and simple once the decoding of his insane style is through.  It seemed that he had stretched his book into a semester\u00c2\u2019s worth of material by being so confusing.  I left the class annoyed that I hadn't learned more about this problem or about the philosophy of time in general.  There was a choice between a final exam and a final paper.  I took the test, which I found shockingly easy.\n\n"

I highly recommend this class and any other class Prof. Albert teaches. He really cares about the student's understanding of the material and takes much of the classes answering questions about the difficult subject matter. My only complaint is that sometimes he would not know when to cut questions off because they often became repetitive or ridiculous, and this hindered him covering all of the material intended. Albert presents the material in a dynamic and entertaining manner and is an excellent lecturer. The various explanations for the central problems in QM are covered and changes the way I view the physical world as well as the nature of my own perceptions. The class requires learning about 3 weeks worth of mathematical formulism, but once you get through this it is well worth it. Also, the math isn't bad for even people who haven't taken any of it since high school.\nWorkload:\n20-25 page Final Paper, one short problem set mid-semester, but that's all the work you will get for this class\n"
