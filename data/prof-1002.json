            "review_content": "\nProfessor Motyl is an absolutely wonderful professor! Manages to create a balanced learning experience- well divided between traditional rote exercises, german film screenings, class discussions and group and individual presentations. Incredibly approachable when you have a problem and also full of interesting information about German and Austrian culture that she will gladly offer when you have questions. I left the class feeling not just that I had a greater grasp of german grammar and a larger vocabulary, but also a greater confidence and ability to express myself in german on a variety of topics like history, philosophy and art. \nDefinitely take her Intermediate 1 Class if you can!\nWorkload:\nA few small group projects, three 300 word essays, four vocabulary lists, a substantial presentation on a topic of one's own choosing, daily small homework's. Overall reasonable to manage, great to not have a final exam. \n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Motyl is by far the star of the Columbia/Barnard German departments! I have had her for Intermediate I, Advanced, and review_contentr review_content, and she has never failed to make class enjoyable and educational, simultaneously. If you are considering taking German, I would highly recommend her. If you're not sure whether you even want to take German, I would recommend her again because she won't let you down. As some of the other students said, she is patient, she will stop and answer questions, and she creates a comfortable atmosphere in each of her classes so everyone can feel included. Obviously, you need to do your homework and the readings, but it's relatively light considering you don't have to write a 20-page paper at the end of the course. Viel Spa\u00c3\u0178!\nWorkload:\nDaily grammar-related homework, 2-3 simple essays, a 10-15 minute presentation, and a final group project where the focus is fun!\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Motyl is a fantastic professor. She's very nice and is always willing to answer questions. She is able to explain difficult concepts clearly and is willing to repeat them several times so that everyone understands. The course is based on Austrian culture, which is a nice change of pace from the primarily Germany-centric courses the rest of the department offers. We discussed Austrian music, economics, history, culture, art, sports, major cities, etc. At the end of the semester we read one book, Arthur Schnitzler's ,,Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein Else.\" The course itself was not too difficult, though there was a lot of work assigned, more than I feel was necessary. We usually had so much homework assigned that we couldn't go over all of it in class. There was one assignment we didn't get to until two months after it was assigned. That's definitely not to say that homework for this class takes up a lot of time; it's just that if you were to go over each individual question in lecture (which we did) then you wouldn't be able to get through it all. Sometimes I felt the assignments were superfluous or just busy work, but most of the time they were valuable. That's really the only bad thing I can say about the course. I'm sure if we had asked Professor Motyl to assign less work she would have; it's just nobody felt it was that big of a problem.\nWorkload:\nMuch more than Intermediate I or II, but not difficult. Nightly assignments (grammar + two other exercises, usually). Three essays about 350 words each. One individual oral presentation, one group presentation. No midterm. One final consisting of two essays.\n"

She is very aware of how people are doing in the class and has an almost maternal quality in the way she relates to her students. that said, she does have rules and deadlines and wants you to meet them. she is readily available to answer questions and seems to always have a word of encouragement. she has to grade people, but she does it in an objective, non-judgmental way. She really wants everyone to enjoy learning, and through it all she manages to teach a ton of stuff. i really learned sooooo much in this class. \nWorkload:\npresentation (small percentage of grade, but a lot of prep work), 3 short essays, vokab lists, final oral presentation (pretty easy), a few little projects. nothing crazy.\n"

            "review_content": "\nIrene is a wonderful professor.  She is very approachable and understanding, and she simply wants everyone to try and to learn.  She assigns grammar homework, which we go over in class, and work from a booklet with different short pieces of writing about austrian culture which stands as the basis for the next class discussion.  She really appreciates and encourages participation, and she always corrects mistakes in a very constructive manner.  She speaks very clearly and is usually easy to follow, as long as you concentrate on what she is saying.  She assigns four small (1 1/2 page) papers, which she grades, critiques, allows you to turn it in again, and averages the pre and post corrected grades for your final grade on the paper. Also, there is no sit-in final.  I thought this class was too challenging for me, as many of the students were completely or nearly fluent in German, but I ended up with a B+, so as long as you try hard and can generally follow what's going on, don't be scared of the grade.  She wants you to do well.\nWorkload:\n4 small papers, small assignments for each class, one individual presentation and one group presentation.  Expect no more than 1-2 hours of preparation for most classes\n"

            "review_content": "\nThis was my first German class taken at Columbia. Irene is a very sweet lady  - very understanding, but, in a very stereotypically German way (even though she's Austrian), won't accept things late, and MEANS it when she says she'll lower your grade if you have more than 3 absences.\nOther than the responsibility of going to class, the class was very light. The homeworks were helpful (just enough to make you learn - not so much that it was excessive). Essay subjects were always presented with enough options to please everyone. Since Irene's teacher training I believe is for a younger audience, she does tend to speak a little slowly, but, the way I see it, you don't want a very fast speaker at this level anyway.\nOverall, quite enjoyable. Nice way to get through German 1201.\nWorkload:\nLight - previous review covered it well.\n"

That said, however, you will feel at times that you are learning somewhat less than you want to. Also, some topics, especially at the very beginning and at the very end of the course (kids' tales and early 20th cent. musicians) tend to be on the boring side. And, at times you wonder if you are back in high (or grade?) school, since you write-in your name on attendance sheet every class.\nWorkload:\n2 projects (medium load); 1 test, 3 essays, 5 vocab lists, non-graded hwks, oral exam, reflections  (all light load).\n"

She wants to help people and her patience is amazing. Take German with her, you won't regret it.\nWorkload:\nMedium- a few short essays, a short homework assignment everyday, a couple of presentations that take some time if you want to do well on the, and a final portfolio that can also be fairly time consuming but is graded fairly easily if you do everything that is required\n"

            "review_content": "\nPrefoessor Motyl is absolutely the best teacher you can have in a language as obscure as German. She is very responsive to questions, spends a LOT of time explaining grammar until everyone in the class understands it. Plus her class is a lot of fun, includes visits to the Metropolitan Museum, the New York City Opera, as well as watching two interesting films related to the material discussed in class. Her class is well-organized, and most important -- EASY. You'll get an A even if you can't say a single sentence in German without making a grammatical error or forgetting the right word. Quizzes are really easy. The only thing Professor Motyl is particular about is vocabulary; and not so much knowing the words, as taking the time to look them up in the dictionary and writing them down in your notebook. I absolutely recommend her.\nWorkload:\nVery light. Homeworks for every class, which you may do 5 minutes before the start of the class. 3 \"essays\" (200-300 words) graded very lightly, more on grammar than on vocabulary or contents; after receiving her initial comments, you are invited to do a rewrite which substantially raises your grade. No midterm and no final!!! Instead, students pair up for a 5-minute interview at the end of the semester, for which Professor Motyl distributes the topics well in advance and allows enough time for preparation; notes in English allowed on the interview. And finally, a portfolio, which compiles the best of your work during the course, and of course your VOCABULARY list. Towards the middle of the term, Professor Motyl has a vocabulary test -- she picks up 5 random words from your vocabulary list and asks you to make a sentence (no worry about grammar as long as you show you can put the word in a proper context; advice: put the words you know best in that vocabulary list). She also requires a short presentation on a topic discussed in class, which you may read straight from your notes. This said, the workload may seem a lot, but believe me, it is nothing that you can't manage by devoting 2 hours of your time per week. An easy A in a 4-point course! \n"
