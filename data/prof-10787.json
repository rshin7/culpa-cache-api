If you're not looking forward to UWriting, you will appreciate having Morrison. A no bullshit kind of guy, Morrison is really interesting and approachable. I would say I got the most I could out of UWriting, especially since I saw some of my friends spend tons of hours for their Uwriting classes doing busy work. \nThe class, itself, was kind of boring, but I think Morrison does the best with what he's working to make the articles we read spark interesting discussion. A lot of work-shopping papers in class. Plus, Morrison makes himself available to meet during office hours or any other time to discuss/plan papers.\nWorkload:\nArticles to read. Don't have to write anything and can get away with not reading once in a while. 3 papers + optional retrospective essay (which most classes require). Plus you get to revise your worst paper. Definitely one of the more chill UWriting classes out there.\n"
