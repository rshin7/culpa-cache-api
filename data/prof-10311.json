Much of the time was spent lecturing and listening to music which made it more of a relaxing course. My favorite part of the class was at the end when she brought special guests who played their music and described their careers. Courtney was sweet, relaxed and helpful. She worked hard to ensure that the students understood the material. From her class i feel that I learned a lot about music, take her class.  \nWorkload:\n2 concert reports, participation, midterm and final; fairly generous/fair grader; do the work and you will get a good grade.\n"

            "review_content": "\nSimply put, Courtney rocks. Very laid back teacher who still cares about the course and dedicates herself to teaching the class about the history/fundamentals of music. Extremely flexible regarding just about anything, Courtney puts in an extra effort to accommodate student difficulties (being not far removed from school herself) and tries to make music fun for the class. Class trips to Verdi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s La Traviata and jazz clubs are also a definite plus. Even though it was an early morning class, Courtney made Music Hum awesome and is totally recommended. Even though you can't choose into her, try to switch in. She's worth it.\nWorkload:\n2 concert reports (3-4 pages each), occasional listening responses (3-4 sentences each), 1 listening assignment (comparison of two pieces, 1 page or so), 1 midterm (5 song IDs, 10 multiple choice, 1 essay, extra credit), 1 final (same as midterm with 8 song IDs instead). All of it easy, all of it generously graded. Enjoy.\n"
