            "review_content": "\nI would highly recommend that anyone with interest in the Spanish language take this course.\nFrancisco is absolutely amazing.  He is clearly interested in the material, he is organized, and he is effective.  He has a passion for his students- he prefers that you use the \"tu\" form with him and call him Francisco to maintain informality and remain approachable.  He is very organized, and he presented the material in a very understandable way.  His accent is also very understandable.  In terms of turning work in, he was very flexible with deadlines and due dates- although getting too far behind on the work wouldn't be a great idea.\nThe material in itself is very, very interesting.  For me, this was the quintessential Columbia class- we learned in-depth about the history and present status of a subsection of a marginalized group in Spanish culture.  Francisco has personal experience with the material which only added to the class.  \nThe class was a mixture of movies, videos, songs, and readings that helped to get across very specific points.  Each week had a theme- sometimes a different time period, sometimes about specific groups of people, etc.  The constant mixup of material helped to make the class more interesting.\nSpeaking practice was definitely emphasized- while I personally think that fluency should be expected at the 3300 level, there was definitely not judgment on the people who were less comfortable.\nGrammar activities were not emphasized.\nThis class will help maintain fluency in Spanish, one personal downside was that there was not much grammar teaching- but Francisco did take plenty of time to correct and make comments on the weekly \"guias\" we turned in.  This was extremely helpful.\n\nWorkload:\n10 \"guias\" (which include readings and writing) (approx 1-2hrs a piece), 2 projects, 1 oral presentation, \"diario\" (collection of what you learned each day, new vocab, improved grammar points), participation, no midterm, no final\n"

            "review_content": "\nTAKE THIS CLASS! I have never felt the need to write a culpa review, until now. Francisco's class was extraordinary and there is no doubt in my mind that he deserves that gold nugget.\nReasons why you should take this class:\n1. I am not a Spanish major, nor am I fluent in the language. I really wanted to improve my language skills and learn about an extremely fascinating topic in the history of Spain. This class let me achieve exactly that. It is meant to \"advance your language through content,\" which it definitely did in the end.\n2. The grading is fair. If you put in the work and show up to class (and participate!), you will probably get an A. It is not easy in the slightest, but if your Spanish skills are not as good as someone else in the class, you will not be penalized. He grades based on effort and improvement, which is always nice.\n3. You learn so much about the culture, in both an academic and social way. You will get to watch videos and see interesting pictures, that you probably would not see otherwise.\n4. You will get up wanting to go to class every day. I could not even fathom skipping one of his classes because the content was just too interesting. Not many classes provide you with this feeling, so keep that in mind.\nMain message: this class is something amazing and different. Take it.\nWorkload:\n1 article worksheet every week (with around 10 questions), 1 oral presentation, 2 big projects, class participation.\nEverything is manageable, but make sure you give yourself enough time for the projects because they are more time consuming than you think.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI took Spanish Pragmatics with Francisco this year to complete an elective requirement for the Hispanic Studies major. It was easily the most organized class and the most prepared teacher I've had at Columbia so far.\nEvery class is taught with powerpoint presentations (that are also available on Courseworks) and he give many helpful handouts with short exercises and examples. \nYou're going to review movies, clips, very short texts. Very few \"theoretic\" knowledge is required (most students are not native speaker or linguistics/philosophy majors), most of it is immediately applied to examples and concrete stuff. Very easy to understand and great if you're planning to study abroad in the Hispanic world. \nThe final proyecto is very long but doable if you start in advance. No midterm/final!\nOverall a great class!\n\nWorkload:\nReading Comprehension very 2 weeks on 4 texts (in English and Spanish) - about 4-6 pages long\n2 \"Diarios de aprentizaje\" where you need to write what you learned in each class\nFinal Proyecto - about 30 pages long\n\n"

            "review_content": "\nI took Intermediate I in the Spring with Francisco and really loved it so stayed in his Intermediate II class for the fall. One of the nicest professor's I've met at Columbia - and one who genuinely loves teaching. Encourages activities in pairs, and is never stern. The work seems like a lot sometimes, but it's fairly standard for the Spanish courses and he is very helpful with in-class assignments that help for the essays and his grading is more generous than fair. He will do everythign he can to help you. Both semesters with him were light-hearted and fun so much so that goiung to class was a pleasure, and I hope to take something else with him in the future.\nWorkload:\n4 essays, midterm, project, final, and workbooks (but they're only graded once all term so you can do them at your own leisure). Standard load for Spanish, and he's a very generous grader. \n"

            "review_content": "\nAs someone said in one of these reviews, Francisco really does have a sweet heart and I can honestly say that every class has been enjoyable. In fact, his class was the most fun class I've ever had in college (I'm going to be a junior). He is kind and understanding if you really can't finish an assignment on time. He encourages us talking to one another, and we often work in pairs for every class. He might call on a student, but he does it in a friendly manner and it's OK if you don't know the answer or sound unsure. \nWorkload:\nReasonable for a Spanish class. The final proyecto takes a really long time so you must make sure to not put it off to the last minute like I did. Also, he doesn't check the weekly workbook assignments (only during the midterm did he do that in my class, so make sure you actually try do them weekly b/c they really help you keep up). \n"

His class always seems to fly by.  I often enjoy going to class, which is saying something.\n2. He has a legitimate interest in helping you learn the language.  If you ever have a question, he will answer it for you, and his critiques on written work are ALWAYS helpful.\n3. He's legit.  And spanish!!  But not the annoying kind of spanish who likes to teach you about how Spain conquered the new world a long long time ago.  The techno-listening, discoteca-hopping, chic kind.\nIn all, TAKE HIS CLASS!!\nWorkload:\nReasonable:\n-5 proyectos assigned about every two weeks\n-Workbook assignments that are only checked at set intervals, so it's okay to not do any workbook one week if you do more the next week\n"

We listen to a lot of music and watch YouTube videos. If you get a chance, TAKE HIS CLASS!!! The most fun class I have ever taken by far. He is also very willing to talk to you at any time, and keeps in contact with you even after class is over. Simply incredible!\nWorkload:\nLightest probably of any class offered at Columbia. One gu\u00c3\u00ada de lectura per week, two proyectos, two diarios, and lots of fun! VERY fair grader, just wants to see you improve. :)\n"

This class reviewed some concepts I already studied, but Francisco reintroduced them in a different way. We discussed a huge variety issues, through watching many movies, and by addressing world issues. Francisco makes clear that just because he is your teacher doesn't mean he can't learn from you as well. He is funny, kind, and unbelievably understanding. All in all, he was my favorite teacher last semester, and my favorite Spanish teacher I've ever had. Do it!\nWorkload:\nVaries. Several projects that increase in size through the term. A small amount of homework. A midterm and a final. Active participation required. \n"

I'm not sure if I improved in my Spanish immensely, but there was a lot of speaking and writing which was nice. A really great guy and really understanding if you need extensions.\nWorkload:\nMidterm (not too bad), Oral exam (easy), and final (haven't taken it yet). 5 projects spread out through the semester...kind of long but the ones involving movies (which was all but 1) we went over a lot in class. Often he assigns activities, but he rarely checks them and he'll tell you in advance if he's going to.\n"
