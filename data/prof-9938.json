            "review_content": "\nChris Volinsky is what you would want out of a professor for a course such as Data Mining. He takes an extremely broad subject matter and distills its component parts without sacrificing technical rigour for the most part. His notes are extremely thorough and credible given his industry background (won Netflix prize couple years back). What this course really excels in though is giving you the toolbox to go off on your data mining tangent when you see fit and create something out of nothing. Just be sure you know some scripting language coming in to operate on the data sets, which get increasingly massive as the semester goes on. These could be any one of R, Matlab, Python, etc it really doesnt matter as the course is not taught via implementation.  \nWorkload:\n6 hw's + project + midterm + final all manageable. One caveat, do not cram the homeworks. They can get tricky since you are implementing them using programming skills not taught in the course. \n"
