As long as you demonstrate that you are taking the class because you are interested in drawing and art and not because you just want to have an easy elective, you will have a good time in the class.\nWorkload:\nDrawing assignments due every week, some requiring several hours of work. Definitely not a breeze (you will look bad if you half-ass your assignments) but also not a super intensive, hard class. Just the right amount of work.\n"
