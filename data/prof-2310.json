            "review_content": "\nThis class had very interesting material and is taught by an equally interesting husband-wife pair from the medical school. They are both PhDs who study the history of medicine and human rights. Professor Rothman (David) is a rather didactic old man who intends to be argumentative and thought-provoking, but comes off belligerent and didactic. His wife does little to control this aspect of his nature. The class is somewhat funny just watching their married dynamic. \nWith that said, the course material is well-picked and is excellent. \nWorkload:\nOne final paper. The Rothmans do little to help you out so if you need it, don't ask them. They don't have office hours and they pretend that everything can be dealt with over e-mail. Reading is variable but ranges on the heavy-side, and they post it all on courseworks, so you use up your quota every week.\n"
