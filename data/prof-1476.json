I suspect that they were disgruntled with their grades on homework assignments, and I would encourage them to spend more time working on future assignments rather than complaining on this forum.  Michael Cheng was solely responsible for the survival of a number of students in Professor Christ's 2800 class.  He was always meticulously prepared for discussion sections, and he went out of his way to provide extra preparatory measures for the final exam.  He is readily comprehensible and will take time to explain things thoroughly in discussion sections.  Furthermore, he's a serious threat on the squash court.\n"
