            "review_content": "\nLike the other reviews said, this is primarily a history class. Not just a history of films or style, but literally a history of the country or culture that produced each film and the effects that they may have had on the filmmaker. \nSome people may find that interesting, but others will find it very tedious. Strangely, all of the papers and the final focus on more traditional aspects of film. So unless you go out of your way to incorporate history and culture into your work, the lecture will have very little relevance on the rest of the course. \nStill, the films were well chosen and Pena is truly encyclopedic in his knowledge of film. Not a class I would take if I wasn't a film major, but it's manageable. \nWorkload:\n9 short (2-3 page) papers, which is actually pretty intense. A take-home final that had to be a minimum of 8 pages (some people wrote 18+). More work than your average film class. \n"

            "review_content": "\nPena is an interesting character.  He is VERY knowledgable about historical facts and filmmaking in general, however does not teach his class like a film class.  He teaches it like a history class, going on for two hours about the history of the respective country and relates that back to the film industry.  You will learn more information about the history of a country than that of its filmmaking.  Pena does not focus on the aspects of filmmaking that make a film class interesting, rather the mundane details that could bore anyone.  This is not to mention his film selection for class.  He chooses to see films that are not necessarily the most popular, but have a political message.  He is more interested in the political aspect than the aesthetic qualities of the film that so many film majors want to know about and learn in other class.  Oh and by the way be prepared to stay EXTRA LATE in his class.  When a class is scheduled to go from 6:10-10:00 it goes from 6:20-10:30 or later, so watch out.  He never starts on time and has no regard for his students.  With this said, however, he is a nice guy and is a wealth of information that seems endless.\n"

He shows GREAT films and shuts up overzealous students during discussion.  he's not too warm & fuzzy, but i appreciated that.  grading depends on the TA, but he assigns the final grade (doesn't like to give out too many A's)\nWorkload:\n9 essays + final\n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Pena is one of the most knowledgable and experienced film professors I have ever taken a class with. He is very passionate about what he teaches, and has a lot fo personal insight to offer about Chinese film. He has personally met a lof of Chinese film directors and recounts his meetings with them, which I found absolutely entertaining. He seems to have a life outside of academia, which is very admirable. My only criticism of the class would be that he assigns way too much unneccesary reading, and the books cost you an arm and a leg. \nWorkload:\nNot bad, if you do only selected readings. Two sets of three, 4 pg papers, and one big final 12 pg paper. (I found the short papers much harder and more annoying than the big one)\n"

He tries to give you a full picture of cinema and he does not impose his views on the students. He is also extremely patient, and he respects everybody's opinions. Nonetheless, he does not lose control over his huge classes. I really loved this class. \n"

            "review_content": "\nHe assigns a lot of unnecessary readings, for one session which are unrealistic to be read in a week's time,  in addition to a workload of papers: 12 1000  word essays(3 for every 4 sets of fims you view each month in class) and a 4000-5000 final paper.  The discussions are insightful but tends to concentrate too much on off-camera bios and infos about each film and its creators.  Therefore, one gets a load of information about who married who or who divorced who while yhe film is made, or who was the grip, blah blah.  On the other hand, Pena is very knowledgeable on film analysis but tends to be bookish.  Your grades depend entirely on one TA even though he has two.  Pena never reads a single student paper in this clss. If you are an international student and you happen to be graded by his TA who is unforgiving of grammatical or syntax irregularities be prepared to get Cs or B minuses even though you have excellent and original analysis for a film.  The films screened are excellent and well picked for the topic.    You'll enjoy the screenings and the discussions in this class.  The latter you'll enjoy more if you plan to win first place in a film trivia contest.\n"

            "review_date": "April 30, 2003",
            "review_content": "\nThis course fulfills an intermediate-level films studies major requirement in international cinema, and it also fulfills a B-level Latin American major cultures requirement.  This makes for an interesting group of students--you've got the film majors who have to take it (some \"substitutions\" can be made) as well as those students who have already taken an A-level Latin American major cultures course and have chosen then to take this course.  Within the latter group there are some students who probably consider that taking a film course to complete the major cultures requirement sounds like a pretty great deal, and there are other students, many of whom are Latin American, who are much more passionate about this course and the issues that it raises.  So basically, this class, at least from my observations, seems like it means different things to people based on who you are, where you're from, and what requirement it is fulfilling for you (if any).  As a film major who didn't fulfill the major cultures requirement in Latin American studies, I must say I was rather disappointed with this course and with Pena.  Considering that it is at least partly a film major requirement, there was definitely a paucity of formal analysis for the films screened in Pena's lectures.  About 90% of each lecture was devoted to the political history of the country from which a specific film or director hailed, leaving about 10% (or in some cases about five minutes of brief lecturing just before the screening of the film) for information about the film's content, its formal characteristics, or anything really of cinematic interest.  Essentially, each four hour (somehow Pena can stretch it to four hours +) class was composed of an hour and a half lecture on the political context of the country from which the film was produced, a screening, and then a discussion (When every film class requires discussion sections in which the TA's diligently take roll, and the lecture seats 50 to 70 students, I have no idea why film professors leave time for discussions at the end of screenings.).  The most interesting thing about the course, however, are the films that Pena selects; they are often quite obscure, and you would never have the chance to see them anywhere else.  The films often have overt political agendas that are quite evident in their narratives, and this would naturally seem to me to lead to questions about the the convergence of art and politics.  However, I don't think Pena touched on this area even once.  Instead, in lectures Pena ruminates on his 1975 tour of most all of Latin America, and, with each class, a different Latin American country is focused on, which encourages the students, who are from the country studied that week, to rant on the political climate of the country and (often) on the shortcomings of the country's political leaders of the past and present.  Plus, Pena isn't all that interesting to listen to--he lacks the savvy of a James Schamus and the broad range of knowledge of a David Sterritt.  Think of the bordeom inspired by an Annette Insdorf but with greater cultural knowledge.  All in all a poor class given its potential, at least from a film major's perspective.\nWorkload:\n3 papers, 2-3 pages on three films for each paper.  Final 10 page paper answering five pointed questions about one film--but you get to choose from five films to write the paper on.\n"
