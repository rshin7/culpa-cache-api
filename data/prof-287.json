Class discussions were terrific, and her writing tips and grading was super helpful. I look forward to taking more classes with her.

            "review_content": "\nThe texts were all right, but my experience was overall not so great. \nProf. Ellsberg was consistently 5-10 minutes late, and a bit disorganized as well. She often went on long tangents that, while interesting, had nothing to do with the class. Consequently, we spent maybe 20 minutes per class actually discussing the reading, which was incredibly frustrating for me, and we were way behind schedule. Additionally, she often forgot whether she had handed back papers or not (usually the answer was no), and she never knew any of our deadlines (literally we'd all have our essays and ask whether she wanted them at the beginning or end of class, and she'd sometimes seem surprised that they were due that day).\nShe often made the class environment feel unsafe for several students of color, myself included (I have not discussed this subject with the white students in our class, but on some occasions they were quite vocal about disagreeing with some of the casually racist things she said). I honestly don't believe that she knew the impact of what she was saying, but sometimes what she said was totally inappropriate and quite offensive.\nOn the upside, she didn't penalize us for her disorganization and tendency to run behind, adjusting her syllabus as necessary to fit. Additionally, she gave good feedback on our essays--I do believe that my writing improved over the course of her class. We workshopped several papers in class, with Prof. Ellsberg explaining her reasoning for making changes and often having us suggest changes by the end of the term, so we could do the same thing on our own as we wrote our papers.\nShe also had us take field trips to various museums around NYC on our own time, which I really liked. \nWorkload:\nNot too bad. The reading is a lot to do if you try to do it in one day, but it's not bad at all. The papers are all short (2 pages). You write two essays and one field journal (2-3 pages), along with revisions for each, and then a couple of book reviews.\n"

While taking Freshman English, I also struggled with the eccentric Ellsberg, trying to figure out what she wanted and how to get an A in her class. The workload was easy and the class, it seemed, a breeze, a cop-out to the more difficult professors offering the course.\nNow as an alum (who majored in English and now teaches English) I can say conclusively, no one at Barnard helped improve my writing like Ellsberg did. She was brilliant, teaching us to cut the self-important, self-indulgent \"intellectual\" nonsense out of our papers and condense everything into two pages. She taught us how to cut the superfluous out and say what you need to say as effectively and concisely as possible. She taught us that good writing was easy to comprehend, effective at conveying a point, and free of pointless popcorn words. \"Simplicity is genius,\" as Einstein said, and Ellsberg taught us how to apply that to our writing. Super grateful I took her course and highly recommend her. Sure she was late sometimes, went in tangents, etc but she was so effective and taught us so much, I have no complaints.\nWorkload:\n2 page papers. Regular reading per week.\n"

I'm writing this review tonight because I stumbled upon my copy of Songs of Innocence and Experience in my bedroom and decided to read through it again.\nAs I read, I realized how clearly I could see Blake's London in my mind's eye: the grimy cesspool of repression and hypocrisy, the vast seas of filth siding up against glimmering palace walls, the tiny children with their shorn heads and lungs full of soot. And then I remembered Byron, and Shelley, and Hopkins, and Eliot, and the Brontes, and I remembered that it was Prof. Ellsberg who brought all of this work to life for me.\nI was a Biology major at Barnard. But you know what? I think Prof. Ellsberg's class was the most important one I took. It's certainly the one I remember the best, and the only one whose material I expect to revisit from time to time for the rest of my life.\nIt truly saddens me to see so many negative reviews of the course on here. Perhaps Prof. Ellsberg is different in seminars, but in my experience, she was never very late to class, and though her lectures were rambling, she rarely talked about herself. She was far more likely to plumb the depths of her IMMENSE knowledge of literature and history and bring in a ton of interesting stories and quotes (she seems to have adhered to the old-fashioned tradition of memorizing a large amount of texts by heart, which I find very noble). \nI'm confused as to why so many people were disappointed with this class, and all I can guess is that perhaps they weren't really letting the work into their heart. I certainly saw a lot of my classmates blowing off even the minor workload. Our final assignment was to memorize a poem, and most people chose Blake's \"The Tiger\" or \"The Lamb\" and could barely even get through those. If you're not going to respect the material, well, of COURSE you're not going to like the class.\nIf you're the kind of person who loves to see history brought to life through literature, take this class. Go to every lecture. Listen. Let this beautiful work into your heart.\nOh, and my final poem was Hopkins's \"Spring and Fall.\" I still remember every word.\nWorkload:\nVery light, but that's as it should be. This class is about intellectual curiosity, not pointless drudgery.\n"

A good 90% of this crisis was due to taking a class with Ellsberg. Now, I'm quite fine with discursive egomaniacal professors as a rule: at least thus far in my collegiate experience, they've tended to be intelligent and knowledgable enough that I learned as much from their tangents as from their actual lectures. Ellsberg, however, although she is no doubt intelligent, ONLY LECTURES ABOUT HER SINGLE FAVORITE TOPIC. That topic is MARGARET ELLSBERG. Anyone interested in actually learning things about, I don't know, say, Literary Approaches to the Hebrew Bible, FLEE WHILE YOU STILL CAN! I'm serious.\nA final note: the other students apparently don't care that she she apparently doesn't care about teaching her students, because they apparently think she's funny and charming. Weird. Also, she's freakishly easy because it's a seminar and she does all the talking. So expect a bunch of \"disagrees,\" and take her if you want to learn absolutely nothing.\nWorkload:\nHa!

All quizzes are graded in class by your peers. You must write them in pen and any crossed off marks will be counted as wrong (to prevent/minimize cheating). A crossed out answer is only ok if you ask her during the quiz. This year, due to the hurricane and cancelled classes, recitation was optional/extra credit.

I always enjoyed her lectures; she is hilarious and brilliant and wants you to leave with a \"treat bag\" of knowledge that you can pull out at a cocktail party. This isn't the class for you if you want to learn how to analyze poetry. This class is more about learning to identify the most famous English poets, their most renowned works, and fun/interesting facts that will make you never forget them. You learn references that you will always be able to use and are forced to memorize them because of the quizzes. The quizzes often repeat poems; there are certain works she wants you to remember and so they will show up on many of the quizzes and she stresses them in her lecture. Ellsberg also always throws in her own anecdotes that always make the class laugh. TAKE THE CLASS. Did I say take the class?\nWorkload:\nReading that is not necessary. Go to class- you need to know the poems she references (and only those) for the quizzes. There are 10 pop quizzes that are identifications of lines from poetry (12 questions long, it is possible to get 120 on them). She drops your two lowest. One 3-4 page paper. One recitation (memorize a poem and say it aloud). \nThe workload is great- just come to class, take notes, and review them before each class so you are ready for the quizzes. Great class, you learn a lot. All you need to do is make sure you do well on the quizzes (most people do).\n"

Yeah right.\nThe things Professor Ellsberg says are beyond inappropriate for a classroom setting, and just in general.  She will constantly throw out racist jokes and comments that make the entire class uncomfortable. It is ridiculous that she is even employed here because she's gotten so many complaints and bad reviews.  But unfortunately, she created the seminar and has been at Barnard too long for anyone to fire her.\nShe has her \"Five Great Writing Laws\" that are absolutely ridiculous. The most ridiculous one? You're not allowed to use the verb \"to be\" in any of her essays. Uh..that's the most common word used. Ever. You won't learn any writing techniques because the whole time you will just be scanning your paper for any \"is\", \"was\" or \"being\"s and looking up synonyms in the thesaurus.\nShe's always late to class, I didn't learn a thing, and now my impression of the English department at Barnard is forever tarnished.  She goes off on too many tangents about her life, her beloved horses, and her successful children.\nThe only good thing about the course is that it was in-residence, so I got to know the girls on my floor quite well, especially since we suffered together. Oh, and her crazy outfits are always amusing. But that's pretty much the extent of it.\n\nWorkload:\nNot bad, read a couple books. 4 essays, no more than 2-3 pages each.

If you are looking for a \"blow-off\" class and you get Peggy, you're in luck. \nShe is never on time and is rarely prepared for the lesson (leading her to run off and make copies, which wastes even more time). She is highly self-righteous and brags constantly. It is not without merit, as when she does buckle down and teach, she is a brilliant woman. However, this is all veiled by her inability to stay on topic, leading interesting discussions to be lost due to her tangents about her kids (and their many achievements) and other irrelevant information.\nSome of the reading you are supposed to do is never discussed, leading most people in my class to often skip it or fall behind (which is unfortunate as they are great texts). You'll spend the first fifteen minutes of class listening to, dissecting, and discussing a CD that each student makes of their two favorite songs. The relevance of this was lost on me, but it was a nice way to get to know the girls on my floor (This class was in-residence when I took it).\nWhile her workshopping and commentary on writing is excellent, she rarely gives back papers. I only got some of my papers back a few days before the final assignment was due. She is also very vague as to what she expects of your work. So if you feel like you're scrambling to understand what she wants, that's perfectly normal.\nI was pretty appalled when I found out that she has worked at this school for so long. Her lack of punctuality and inability to prepare for a lesson alone makes me wonder why I pay so much for this school. Also, she did not give us our grades until the second day of the next semester. \nI'm sorry to those who read this and have no choice as to who their professor is, but that's just one of the many failings of the FYE program. Basically, just take all her advice, participate, and write your essays using her guidelines (which in my opinion, remove all the individuality of the writer's voice). \nYou get to do some cool field trips, which is nice. But that's where my praise for this class ends. \nWorkload:\n5-6 novels, plus two movies, and a few short stories. Not terribly heavy considering you don't really have to read most of it. Skimming will do. 4 papers (one of which will be workshopped in front of the entire class). All of them are graded at the end of the semester. \n"

Usually quite late (5-15 minutes).  Often obscenely late.\nEvery class started with a long, rambling story that had nothing to do with literature.  On the day that we were to discuss Hamlet--you know, one of the signal works of Western literature, that Hamlet--she spent the entire *first half* of the class telling a story about her horse.\nOne day, she spent about an hour talking about the structure of fairy tales--even though it perilously little to do with the book she was \"lecturing\" on.  Then, a few weeks later, she gives *the exact same* talk on fairy tales, gobbling up another hour!  There was this surreal, twilight-zone feeling in the class: \"Wait, didn't she already talk about this...?\"\nShe didn't learn anybody's names at the start of the semester, but then, *halfway* through the semester, one day at the start of class she suddenly said, \"today I'm going to learn everybody's names!\"  But instead of just learning our names, she spent the *whole class* riffing on people's names and where they came from.  (\"John Doe, oh, I knew a Doe in such-and-such place once, what a guy, blah blah blah...\")\nThe whole of the writing is two two-page papers.  Easy, yes, but also kind of embarrassing.  But she has a lot of ridiculous, petty pet peeves about essay writing--which she springs on you *after* you've turned in the paper. Ah, almost forgot!--she returned the midterm *one week* before the final.\nShe made a number of factual mistakes in her lectures--\nwhich made my lecture notes totally worthless.\nPlus, the lectures were preposterously disorganized.  It's hard to say that there were \"digressions\", because \"digression\" implies a coherent central argument from which one digresses.  Is it possible to have speech which is nothing but digressions?  Ellsberg put this philosophical question to the test.  I finally started taking notes on my computer, and treated her lectures like a puzzle: the challenge was to use select-and-drag to assemble a coherent line of reasoning before class ended.  It wasn't easy!  It was like a super-hard kind of tetris.\nThe ID-only exams are a joke that certainly don't encourage any kind of careful reading of the texts.  And at one point in the semester, she seemed to actually discourage us from doing the readings, saying something like, \"You know, one of the great skills in life is to get an idea of a book without actually reading it...\" (wink, wink, nod, nod).  This came before one of our longer readings, and it basically amounted to telling us, \"Just forget about reading it!  Who cares?\"  Is this really what we're looking for at one of the most famous and expensive schools in the world?\nAnd generally speaking, Ellsberg is just a profoundly disorganized individual.  I don't know if there's some deeper problem, or what.  But she is a spectacularly terrible teacher.  Take a shambles, and then shamble it again, and then you have something almost as shambolic as Ellsberg's class.\nHer class made me ashamed to be a student at Barnard/\nColumbia.  One day a classmate invited a really bright friend, a smarty-pants undergrad from a prestigious school in England, to sit in on the class, and I just burned with shame at somebody seeing something so shameful associated with Barn/CC.\nI have no idea why this professor received any positive reviews.  Stay away.  Trust me.\nWorkload:\nAs much or as little as you'd like; it's all kind of a joke in the end.\n"

In high school I received positive feedback about my writing and I have always considered it one of my strong points. Still, Professor Ellsberg made me realize right away that I had a lot to work on. More important, in a single semester with Ellsberg my prose improved far more than it did in the past four years combined. Her \u00c2\u201cEllsberg Style Sheet\u00c2\u201d is the single most important handout I have ever received. Now, I seek conciseness above all, abhor \u00c2\u201cto be\u00c2\u201d verbs (\u00c2\u201cThey\u00c2\u2019re boring! Interesting verbs carry the weight of your essay!\u00c2\u201d), and worship the serial comma. Ellsberg points out small, easy-to-fix details that improve the quality of writing considerably. \nOther than that, the books were fantastic\u00c2\u2014Jhumpa Lahiri comes to mind, but we also read Philip Roth and E. L. \nDoctorow\u00c2\u2019s Ragtime\u00c2\u2014and occasionally we watched appropriate, intriguing films. A fieldwork paper comparing two immigrant neighborhoods in New York rounded out the course nicely. Above all, Ellsberg is hilarious and quite quotable (every class I found myself jotting down her hilarious comments in the margins of my notebook). I would name her the best teacher I have worked with. Take her course, you won\u00c2\u2019t regret it.\nWorkload:\nVery manageable. Four two- to five-page essays (in many cases, two-pagers trump five-pagers\u00c2\u2014the woman is all about elegant brevity), three revised, all to be collected in a final portfolio in which extra revisions are welcome (and encouraged).

Make no mistake, Ellsberg is a great professor to take a class with and an even better person to be friends with. She's funny, warm, caring and obviously intelligent. If you're looking for a class where you're guaranteed to laugh and stay awake, take this one. If you're looking for a class where you actually hope to learn about Major English Texts, look elsewhere.\nWorkload:\nThere is a light reading list, a midterm, 4-5 page paper and a final. Do the reading at your own paces, and if you can manage to put together two coherent sentences, you should get an A on the paper. Overall, this class was an easy and enjoyable A.\n"
