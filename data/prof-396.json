The discussions we had in class were some of the most thought provoking and interesting and comfortable discussions I've had all year. \nShe also brought snacks every class and treated all of us so kindly. I'm not sure how approachable she is in her larger classes (we only had seven kids in our class) but she was very friendly and easy to talk to.\nShe's not the most organized but I loved that about her. Not every teacher should teach the same rigid, unpredictable way. But if you can't handle that teaching style, maybe think twice about it.\nThe workload is a little heavy but worth it. If you're someone who truly loves literature and appreciates it, take this class. Don't come looking for an easy A otherwise.\n\nWorkload:\nfour or five essays. Weekly online posts that aren't too long. A new book to read every few weeks (none were very long at all). \n"

            "review_content": "\nI started out loving this class but I DO NOT feel that way now!  Spiegel is unorganized.  While the other sections were reading literary favorites and writing essays, we were discussing memory the ENTIRE semester.  We read books, articles, and watched movies about memory and history.  It seems to be her expertise which she then applies to every course that she teachers - whether it is this course or a film course, I have a feeling that the syllabi are very similar.  \nWe were supposed to have weekly courseworks postings but she stopped those because she kept forgetting to put up prompts and questions for us to discuss. She didn't assign us any essays to write until halfway through the semester so we had to rush in 3 essays instead of having them spread out thanks to Spiegel's unorganized and chaotic nature.\nAnd then is the grading.  It took her a VERY long time to give us our grades for the first paper.  We were graded harshly and everyone in the class said that they were surprised by her harsh and rather rude comments and grades.  This could partly be because it was our first grade all semester and she told us that we were all doing better than we ended up doing on the paper.  On the same note, I asked her if I should rewrite a draft of my essay and she said it was not necessary and that  I would do very well on the paper.  Well, she lied.  I did not do very well and it is not just that I have oddly high standards.  I did not improve from the paper before - instead she gave me the same grade slash the grade one portion of a grade higher (ex. B/B+ or B+/A-).  \nIn the end, I DO NOT recommend this class because I am unhappy with the way Professor Spiegel handled the structure of the course and the grading.  She was fake, unorganized, and unnecessarily harsh.  If she wants us to improve and learned from our past assignments, space them out throughout the semester and not squish them into the last two months.  \nWorkload:\nAbout a book or movie a week with the occasional article.  If you are smart and a good BSer, you can get away without completing a book or two.\nWeekly courseworks postings until she forgets to put up the question for too many weeks in a row\nEssays. We had 3 because she didn't assign us any until halfway through but I think she originially said she would assign 5.  They were other random written assignments on the syllabus that she did not assign us to do\n"

            "review_content": "\nBoth Professor Spiegel and her British Lit class are difficult to describe, but I'll try: The syllabus, which consists of several films as well as novels, is a great one. It's hard not to like most of the works, and even if you hate one of them, it's easy to vent--in class, on CourseWorks, maybe even in a paper. \nProfessor Spiegel lectures with a rather quiet voice, laughs all the time about stuff that most people don't find funny, and does absolutely nothing that will help or hurt your final grade. She has absolutely nothing to do with it. You write two papers--one 5-7 page one halfway through the semester, one 10-12 page final due at the end. For both, you can choose just one book OR movie to write about, so...\nYou can NEVER come to lecture, NOT READ anything, NOT WATCH any of the films except for two, write your first paper about one movie, write your final about the second movie, turn them in, and get anywhere from a C- to an A for your final grade. Maybe the weekly CourseWorks posts (basically responses of 3-5 sentences on the works for the week) matter, but I doubt it. Even if they do, they take 5 minutes each, whether you know what you're talking about or not. The quality is not judged.\nProfessor Spiegel doesn't read the papers, either. Her TA does, so if you have a generous one, you're good. If he/she is harsh, you're probably screwed. You should base your decision on whether to take the class on the TA.\nWorkload:\nA bunch of novels and films you don't have to read/watch at all, weekly CourseWorks responses, one 5-7 page midterm paper, one 10-12 page final paper.

The goal is to broadly address different themes of the American experience, combining history, politics, literature, and film. It really gives you new perpsectives on American life, and you learn to analyze elements of culture in new ways. \nThe class has about 40 people, but it runs like a seminar, and the profs are always asking for discussion (though often it stayed silent). Weekly discussion sections are very helpful and thought-provoking, and the TAs are extremely qualified and wonderful. Both professors are amazing and very friendly, especially Delbanco, whose lectures and questions are very profound and stimulating (he's also a very established scholar of American history/literature). \nThe reading is very heavy, but you really should do as much as you can. Your only grades are two big papers based on a topic of your choice, so you can definitely skip readings and get away with it, but you'll be lost in class and get much less out of the course. \nWorkload:\nTwo 7-10 page papers; reading that's heavy but mostly ungraded. \n"

            "review_content": "\nIt's completely understandable why Spiegel gets a wide spectrum of reviews.  She is a very smart woman, and cares greatly about both literature and her students, but her teaching style can be frustrating.  While her classes are billed as lectures, she attempts to conduct them like seminars, which generally results in the same talkative people (often auditors) making inane and arbitrary comments.  To Spiegel's credit, she can generally work these comments into her larger scheme for the class, and isn't hesitant to tell you when she disagrees with you.  Her \"lectures\" are pretty disorganized, but this seems a product of her syllabi.  The books she chooses are fantastic, and are not canonical works with years of previous scholarship, so she seems genuinely to be grappling with the texts, and expects her students to do the same.  \nShe is kind of spacey - for Brit Lit, we didn't receive our first papers back until a few weeks before the next paper was due, and didn't receieve our final grades until the next semester - but she is a fair grader and is eager to meet with you about the class or your papers.  She is also open to rewrites, which can be key in a two paper course.\nWorkload:\nSimilar for both Brit Lit and American Lit since 1945 - two papers usually (5-7 pages each), lots of readings and films, and occasional online postings.  Totally reasonable, especially when the books are so great.\n"

Instead of lecturing using line by line (or scene by scene) interpretations of a novel or film, Spiegel guides the class in how to open a narrative.  Once the story is opened she applies it to different sociological / philosophical areas in life.  Her lectures are clear, engaging, and thought provoking. Her thinking \"outside of the box\" approach to LIterature & Film is what makes her classes such enjoyable experiences.  I know that some reviewers dismiss her as being \"scattered\" or \"flighty,\" and honestly, I don't know why. I had Spiegel for two classes last fall, and she was well prepared for both classes. In addition, she gives freely of her time during office hours to help you with any paper concerns or questions you may have about her class.

Her lectures don't seem to have any structure, and she often seems unprepared.  All of her classes are taught as open discussions, but with the class size being so large, this format doesn't seem to work as well.  Often she seems to go off into tangents, and sometimes it seems like you are hearing the same thing over and over again.  Also, she often seems to forget things on the syllabus, including our midterm.  (We wrote a paper, so I suppose she used that instead.)  All of this being said, however, she does seem like a friendly person, and I know several people who have enjoyed talking to her in office hours.       \nWorkload:\nModerate--if you think that the workload is too much, it's easy to persuade her to postpone the deadline.  In that way, she's very understanding.  American Studies had a lot of movie screenings (and not good movies) so you may want to keep that in mind.

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Spiegel is everything I had hoped a liberal arts education would be about.  In addition to the most solid syllabi EVER, her lectures are super informative and often pulled from many sources, including text, photography, film and whatever else happens to be on her mind (usually something cool in science, philosophy or current events).  She doesn't shy away from controversy, and teaches her courses with reverance for the material and her students.\nWhile some think her lectures are disorganized, she really tailors them to what she thinks the students find most interesting about the works.  The key to a good Spiegel class is participation.  While the syllabus lays out how much time she wants to spend with each text or topic, it seems like Spiegel comes to class with a very basic daily agenda.  Based on the direction of discussion or questions from students, Spiegel will often tailor her lecture to the points of most interest and the class will inevitably turn to discussion.  Does this lay a groundwork where one or two students can dominate the class?  Yea, but with such enjoyable texts and materials, there's no reason everyone in the class shouldn't be chomping at the bit to participate.  Plus, in one of my classes with her, the girl who kept steering the class was super smart, so it worked out for the best!\nSpiegel also does what I've found few lit professors prepared to do and takes an extra day with material if she feels like there's enough interest.  We did excise one reading from one of my classes with her, and re-worked what our assignments would be to compensate.\nThough her grades aren't always the first to come in (and, yes, she does take a while to grade), it's worth the effort to pick-up your papers and/or exams because they come with detailed comments.  So, her grades may take a while, but that's because she thoughtfully and fully reads and responds to each student's work.\nIf you go to class, do the readings (which are reasonable and usually very, very good), attend the film screenings (at least a few) and participate in class, you're papers will be very easy to write and the exams or take home materials will be fine.\n\nWorkload:\nTwo papers (5-7 pages) and a mid-term (which may or may not be take home . . . or cancelled)\n"

I was left listening to the same stupid girls over and over saying how this part reminded them of when their grandmother died and then they read Moby Dick.  Avoid Spiegel at any cost, it's a waste of your time and tuition money since you won't get  a thing out of it.\nWorkload:\nModerate.  Lots of reading but there was a take home final, which is nice.  Two papers.\n"

She is not only an interesting, provocative, and caring professor, but she also generates a warmth in her classroom comparable to no other English Professor at Columbia. She does not just teach books as relics with no relevance to contemporary soceity, but teaches them as tools in which one can understand themselves and their environment. If you come to this class having read all the books and prepared to think and not just be told what to think, then you will learn interesting new ways to examine the soceity around us.\nWorkload:\nTons of reading, but she is a easy grader. \n"

            "review_content": "\nProf. Spiegel can seem a little spacey but all in all I thought the class was worth it. She picked a decent selection of literature, and if you're worried that \"British\" works are going to be all staid and stodgy then you're in for a surprise - we read covered the decline of empire and the traditional British society, sex and violence, race relations, all that. We had to see just as many movies outside of class as there were books (something I didn't expect), and that was a real crapshoot - some of the films were brilliant, others were unrelated to the books and utter wastes of time where I thought I'd run out of the room screaming. That being said, you could probably get by in this class only reading a couple of the books so long as you see some films.\nIn such a huge class there was a tendency for just a few people to dominate conversation. This is one of the easier English classes, and people knew it. Anglophiles like myself will pleased. On top of this, Maura is a genuinely nice person who will talk with you at length about any topic in British literature. She certainly knows her stuff, and I enjoyed her lecturing style - it kept me awake, which is something I can't say about all my professors.\nHOWEVER, A MAJOR POINT: It is now June 11, I handed in my final papers a month ago, and I have yet to see a grade. This bothers me, and I'm sure it's bothering the graduated seniors even more. Also, we never got around to reading any of the short stories on the syllabus, nor did we have a final novel (all of the possibilities she had originally presented looked very interesting, and so I was disappointed when we never read them).\n"

She is not professor material--certainly not Barnard/Columbia material, and probably not even high school material. Her \"lectures\" were the worst I've experienced in my 3 years of college, and her ability to foment interesting discussion was virtually non-existent. Furthermore, she took weeks to correct our midterms, and as of June 7th I've heard neither hide nor hare about our second papers (due mid/late April), final exams (early May), or final grades. Previous CULPA reviews warned me about her, but I ignored them; BIG MISTAKE. My intellectual development would have been much better served spending 3 credit hours per week huffing solvents instead of diligently attending her classes. They are a total waste of your money and time. The good news is that, like the large portion of the class that did so, you can safely skip every last one of her lectures and probably still do very well. But if you want to learn anything whatsoever, look elsewhere. My advice: if you see a class she's teaching that looks interesting, buy the books on the reading list (if she bothers to make one up). then don't take the class.\nWorkload:\nA book and a movie every week or so; 3 papers.\n"

The result is a weekly two-hour waste of time where Professor Spiegel bubbles enthusiastically about whatever we were supposed to be discussing that week but, because no one does the work, very little discussion is stimulated. I blame the English department for allowing such a course  -- either require term papers on the material we looked at in class, or don't require seminars at all and allow students to turn in some sort of scholarly work at the end of the semester that they wish.\n"

Her lectures are very thoughtful and interesting, and she raises some provocative questions about the texts. It is often very irritating that she tries to make the class a discussion, though--sometimes she'll ask a question, and either nobody will respond, or someone will feel the need to give a 20-minute oral summary of the senior thesis s/he plans to write about the book. When Professor Spiegel talks, though, it is usually rather interesting. She does do a good job of providing historical context for the books, and presenting various critical analyses. She also has very strong opinions, and is not very open to interpretations that are contrary to her own. The biggest problem with the class is the grading system. She had a graduate student \"reader\" who she did not introduce until the day we turned in our first paper (even then she never told us his name, and he never spoke to the class), and who was a very nitpicky and difficult grader. We turned in our take-home exams in mid-April, and they have yet to be returned, and Professor Spiegel has said that we will not be able to pick them up (or our papers, which we turned in a week ago) until after everyone leaves to go home for the summer. Basically, we have gotten 1 assignment back for the entire semester, and most of us will probably never see the comments on the other two assignments--I think that's inexcusable for a teacher. If you're willing to put up with this, though, take the class; the books she chooses are wonderful, and it is entertaining to listen to her discuss them.\nWorkload:\n2 papers (a 5-7 pg. and a 8-10 pg.) and a take-home exam, which consists of three 2 page essays.\n"
