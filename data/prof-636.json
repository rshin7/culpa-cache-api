Usually the first 20 minutes are devoted to taking attendance and the last 30 minutes are used to watch a video clip. Class is very stress free. Janet Soares is quite a big figure in the dance scene in NY. She used to be a dancer and dance critic herself. When she lectures, however, she stutters and seems to lack confidence. Therefore, I was suprised to learn that she was such an authority figure in this field.\nWorkload:\n6 dance reviews (2/3 of your grade) 1 eight to ten page final paper (1/3 of your grade) \n"
