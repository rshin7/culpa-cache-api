Please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and do not take a class with him. Friends in his thesis seminar confirm that he is a terrible professor. Instead of encouraging participation, he makes people scared to speak up. I know of several people that he made cry. I am writing this review because I do not want you to endure what I had to. DO. NOT. TAKE. HIM.\nWorkload:\nAbsurd -- 300+ pages of reading plus a graded response every week, plus a 20 page seminar research paper, plus a field trip....\n"
