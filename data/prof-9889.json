            "review_content": "\nEven though Frontiers is a poorly run class, most of what even helped me get through it was having Elnaz as my seminar leader. She is kind, understanding, and she does realize that Frontiers is a joke (either in a positive or negative way).  She grades (for the most part) easy.  Her power points review the important material learned in class, so you essentially don't have to attend. Her quizzes involved either reading the lecture notes or being able to do a back of the envelope calculation. Her only downside is in that she does not know how to interact with a college class. Yes, we are freshmen, but that does not mean that you can talk to us like we are little kids. But besides that, she is easy to deal with. And she does give out candy...and arranges a reasonably entertaining review session tournament game before the final.\nWorkload:\nWeekly Individual Assignments (10 total, takes an hour tops, grades mostly on effort)\n5 quizzes (easy if you studied the lecture notes or managed to stay awake in lecture)\nMidterm (2 five part questions and an essay)\nFinal (2 three part questions, 2 five part questions, and an essay)\n"
