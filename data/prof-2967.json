There were more C's than not on the midterm and papers. \nShe also doesn't know how to lead a discussion. She didn't engage the class at all. Dehn was so bad, in fact, that at least 3/4 of my class switched to a different lithum section to avoid her.\nWorkload:\nAverage for lithum\n"

            "review_content": "\nDehn is a fabulous teacher with a real instinct for leading a discussion. But even if you're stubborn and don't want to answer, even the simpler questions that seem like an insult to your intelligence (or an insult to the depth with which you read the sparknotes) she's prepared with another question, or (gasp) a group activity. That would be my only complaint. But they aren't activities, really, they're just smaller group discussions. Dehn is young, approachable, very smart, and most importantly, manages to get all the important stuff about the books out in the discussions while keeping it interesting. You can, though I wouldn't recommend it, not read all the books, sparknote them well, PAY ATTENTION and take notes in class, and do ok to well on the midterm and final IDs. Not neccesarilly the papers and analysis stuff, but you knew that. \nTough grader on papers, but she'll bump you up on your final grade for class participation if you are engaged. And if you go meet with her, as she encourages, you will learn to write better. \nWorkload:\nNo additions to the Lithum curriculum other than a commentary article on genesis, one or two short assignments int he beginning of the semester, then two papers, one 5-7 and one 8-10, which she really tries to help you prepare for. If you want that extra boost from class participation, sparknoting will not get you there. \n"

            "review_content": "\nDehn is an extremely good teacher. She went to Harvard and is now getting her Ph.D at Columbia but you wouldn't think she is so busy because she puts so much effort and passion into everything she does for the class. She knows her stuff perfectly any question you have she can answer it and she's great at striking up good discussions. You'll learn so much from her, more than you'll ever expect. Because she's very smart, though, she's a hard grader when it comes to the papers. She loves when you make an extra effort to meet with her and is super helpful. If you're not a great writer though, beware. I wasn't but she was too good to give up. Participate and she'll love you.\nWorkload:\nJust the typical Lit Hum readings. Keep up on readings, participate, do well on your papers and you're golden. \n"

            "review_content": "\nDehn once gave us very practical advice on how to conduct our lives once we all became Victorian scholars. \n(Obviously, she never questioned that we would eventually become Victorian scholars.) That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her sort of humor\u00e2\u20ac\u201d\ndry, deliberately divorced from reality, and delivered in monotone. Though it often takes a few seconds to realize she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cracked a joke, her sense of irony is incomparable. \nI was in Dehn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first year teaching Lit Hum. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know she was the instructor until she introduced herself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dshe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s young (mid-20s?) and asked us to call her by her first name. But don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect her to act like a student (like other PhD candidates sometimes will). She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been educated at Harvard and Cambridge, and fully embraces her role as professor. \nThis means tough grading (once she said a paper that does everything right gets a B). At first she created a tense atmosphere by telling us how many As she gave out on an assignment, but this stopped second semester. \nThankfully her individual feedback will teach you more (though it can be a little vague and abstract). She reads papers especially closely and will criticize any sentence that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make perfect sense, or any idea that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not fully developed. I often felt depressed reading through the many negative comments, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll include a nice thoughtful paragraph at the end (though even that one sometimes has a few barbs). Pay attention, though, and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but become a better writer in her class. She sets very high standards for her students, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re always encouraged to meet her expectations. Sure, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re impossibly high, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll always be challenged. \nTime in class, for the most part, was well spent. This could partly be because there were lots of intelligent and interesting students in the section, but Dehn also did a good job leading discussions. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d give a short-and-\nsweet introduction, generally avoiding lectures. \nDiscussions stayed on track (sometimes a specific track, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather talk about punctuation than religion). She does a great job encouraging students who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shut up during the entire class. She often split us into small groups to do some project, which was sometimes helpful and sometimes a time-filler. But the actual conversations were always interesting, mostly because she won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put up with nonsense. Sometimes you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make a comment and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be all, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153uh-huh, does anyone else have an interpretation?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crushing but educational. \nDespite the intensity, morale was high in the class. She took us to the Met for a class trip, and totally outshone the tour guide. Afterwards, another student told me, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153God, that tour-guide was so jealous she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be as cool as Dehn.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sort of strange, and extremely intelligent. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t slack off her in section, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get a real education. And students outside of your section will know who she is, because her students love to love/hate her. You won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget her, or the class. \n\nWorkload:\n2 papers (4-6, 8-10 pages), midterm and final, random 1-page writing assignments, a few quizzes (she'll warn in advance)\n"
