            "review_content": "\nI took this class in fall 2012 but haven't had a chance to add my two cents about the class until now.\nDelbanco is a pretty great lecturer with a great handle on the material and very interesting points. My only complaints are that (1) he doesn't follow the syllabus really -- by the end of the semester we were pretty behind on what we were reading for lecture, so sometimes lecture/discussion plans didn't match up exactly and some things we had to speed through and (2) I took the class in NoCo 501. Anyone who's ever taken a class there knows that it's almost impossible to stay awake every class. There's something about that classroom (the desks? the stuffiness? the heat?) that makes learning so much harder in there. I took another class there in the spring and it was the same deal. Avoid that room if you can!!\nThe reading list is great, I think the course title is pretty accurate. There's a lot of variety, from Puritan sermons to Emily Dickinson to Moby Dick/Melville's short stories. I really enjoyed the later works especially (Melville is great and there's a lot to think about there, plus Delbanco is an expert). I'll agree with the reviewer that you get what you put into it -- you don't have to do all the reading (I didn't, but wish I had had the time to) or attend lecture (no attendance).\nYou do have to sign up for a discussion section (attendance mandatory). I guess maybe I should have tried to get it with Delbanco but you just sign up for a time slot and I got Zach (Roberts). He was incredible -- a pretty laidback guy, very approachable, very knowledgeable, clearly invested in the class and the texts. I'm really glad I was in his section and I felt like I got a lot out of the 50 minute discussions because he was open to people's ideas and also tried to get our input on what we wanted to talk about. A decent grader and he left very insightful comments on papers. He was pretty flexible with paper topics -- there's one provided in the class syllabus for each paper but he let us explore whatever we were interested in in the text, and also he understood if we were a little behind on reading. I've heard that the other TAs were pretty good too, but obviously I'm biased toward thinking Zach was the best.\nAll in all, I really enjoyed the class. The discussion section definitely made it for me -- I don't think I'd have liked the class half as much without it (or understood the text half as well). \nWorkload:\nTwo papers, I think the first one was 3-5 pages and the second 5-7, something like that. The second one was about two pages longer than the first.\nNo midterm.\nChoice between final exam and final paper (8-10 pages). I chose the paper so not sure how the exam went but it was supposed to be some passage IDs, explications, essays.\nReading was doable and you could get away with not doing it all if you were busy. \nI don't really know how the class was graded but probably some combination of the above, plus discussion. The TA did the grading.\n"

            "review_content": "\nLehecka and Delbanco are the shit.  This class is brilliant.  Take it if you have ANY interest in education whatsoever.  The reading is well chosen and thought provoking.  That being said, the assignments are several hundred pages of reading a week.  So, take this class when you've got some free time (ie not when you're in CC or Lit Hum).  This seminar is worth it.  Google Lehecka and Delbanco, and you'll be so appreciative that you get to be in a room with them and have one on one discussions with them.  They are fascinating people.  Course admittance is by interview, so Lehecka knows everyone in the seminar and hand picks people.  Discussions are really interesting.  Note: Lehecka and Delbanco are probably the slowest speakers on the whole campus - but they're also saying some deep shit.  We also had Prezbo come talk to us about affirmative action.  So boss.  So glad that I had the opportunity to take this course.  \nThere's also a volunteering component of the course at the Double Discovery Center. It's 4 hours a week, so yes, time commitment. But if you care about improving education, then this will be a valuable resource.  Plus the DDC is on campus and the students there are driven, so it's a pretty great experience.  \nWorkload:\nHeavy reading, 3 super easy papers (ie talk about your feelings and reference papers), a few meetings with Lehecka (which is great - he offers career advice and actually cares about you)\n"

He expresses the points and insights you should be getting from the readings clearly and with a passion that is contagious.\nHis class is very much a 'get out of it what you put into it' one, as there are relatively few graded works and no midterm. That makes it approachable for majors and non-majors alike.\nUnfortunately, you must sign up for the discussion session in class, so you may not actually get him for the weekly session (which is where attendance is really taken). Even if you sign up on SSOL the sessions are redone the first week.\nWorkload:\nOne 3-page paper the first month, one 5-page paper right before midterms, one 10-15 page paper as final OR take the final exam.

Gee, that's funny. Delbanco hasn't bothered to update his American Studies bio in 3 years. It lacks all his latest honors and publications. Among countless honors one notices: \"In 2001, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and named by Time Magazine as \"America's Best Social Critic.\" If he was in rock he'd be Billy Joe Armstrong. If he lacked self esteem he'd be nuts. If being around a star intimidates you, why did you come to Columbia? Go to CCNY, and save your parents' money. If you think anybody slightly more dignified than Carter at the Grammies is \"pompous\" or \"Ivy\" then leave the Ivy.

The goal is to broadly address different themes of the American experience, combining history, politics, literature, and film. It really gives you new perpsectives on American life, and you learn to analyze elements of culture in new ways. \nThe class has about 40 people, but it runs like a seminar, and the profs are always asking for discussion (though often it stayed silent). Weekly discussion sections are very helpful and thought-provoking, and the TAs are extremely qualified and wonderful. Both professors are amazing and very friendly, especially Delbanco, whose lectures and questions are very profound and stimulating (he's also a very established scholar of American history/literature). \nThe reading is very heavy, but you really should do as much as you can. Your only grades are two big papers based on a topic of your choice, so you can definitely skip readings and get away with it, but you'll be lost in class and get much less out of the course. \nWorkload:\nTwo 7-10 page papers; reading that's heavy but mostly ungraded. \n"

This class puts this assumption firmly to rest. The class is incredible. Delbanco is extremely smart and it is clear that he has devoted much of his life to the texts we read in class, including the puritanical texts and many of Melville's works. More importantly, he is an extremely stimulating and engaging lecturer and, get this, he actually cares about his students. By the end of the semester, had learned many of our names (even those not in his section). I did come across some who found Delbanco to be pompous. This is simply not true. He is one of the most down-to-earth professors at Columbia. I did agree with the criticism that he is overly indulgent when it comes to some authors like Melville, for whom few others shared his passion. Don't take the advice of those below. This guy is great.\nWorkload:\nA book per week (standard for English classes), discussion sections, Midterm (or Paper) and Final (or Paper). \n"

It's jointly taught by Roger Lehecka and Andrew Delbanco, who are quite possibly the slowest talkers on this entire campus, but it's a small seminar, the readings are fascinating, and the service componant really enhances everything. I'm not sure why Delbanco actually teaches anything, because Lehecka is the real authority, but having both of them there gives insightful and sometimes differing views. Plus Lehecka is this cute old man, but when you talk to him, you realize that he's brilliant, that he founded the Double Discovery Center when he was a student here, and that he's one of the most renowned educators in the country. Kind of amazing, actually. If you're interested in education AT ALL, take this course!\nWorkload:\nSomewhat heavy, but we never actually discussed all the readings- most were just to provide us with background information so we could discuss.

Delbanco is one of the best professors as a person at Columbia. He's a very straight shooter who does not deal in bullshit whatsoever. He challenges people to not be lazy thinkers, and challenges assumptions without being intimidating. \nThe class is very good. A few of the early texts are somewhat dry but you can get a lot out of them if you do the readings, weekly assignments, and the lecture. A lot of the stuff later on is really fun. Lectures are easy to listen to and always valuable. Class deals with literature (including early sermons and pamphlets) in the context of its time and in later contexts; a lot is about how the text has been reinterpret and recontextualized, by critics, the public, and other authors. It is like Lit Hum in some ways but much more interesting, and challenging. \nCriticism: Delbanco gets a little bit too into close-reading Melville to the point where he doesn't get into as much background as with other authors and even devotes a lecture to a book you don't read in class (Moby Dick) but Melville is what he really lvoes so at least the lectures are passionate.\nThere's a lot of reasons that people wouldn't want to take the class, but most of those reasons have to do with the person in question being a tool, so you should probably take this class if you're not a tool.\nWorkload:\nLots of reading; early midterm; final OR essay; weekly assignments.\n"

Don't expect this time around to be much more enlightening.  Remember reading Billy Budd and Bartleby in 10th grade?  The lectures now aren't much different.  Thoreau, Dickinson, the list goes on, and all he really talks about is the theme of \"individualism,\" which you can get just from reading the texts.  Delbanco spends the first class on each book dancing around the issues, kind of talking about the writer, kind of talking about whatever he wants to talk about on that given day.  Then when he actually gets to the book, he talks a little bit about plot, a little bit about the characters, and then he tells some cute personal anecdotes; however he never gets into anything interesting.  He does place the works historically (especially the early Puritan stuff) which makes them more bearable, but that's about the extent of it.  Don't get me wrong, he's a really sweet guy and I want to be his friend or something, but if you want to look at these texts on any level deeper than the obvious christ imagery and the \"individualism\" theme, don't take this class.  Oh yeah, and he dedicates 2 entire class periods to lecturing on Moby Dick, even though its not on the reading list and is never assigned (not even parts of it).  If you want a really enlightening professor, look into Bruce Robbins.\nWorkload:\nhigh school midterm with lots of IDs, same with final (it's optional if you write a paper instead), a couple papers - not too much, a lot of really boring but easy reading that you really don't have to do\n"

The class is worth taking as an English major, as Delbanco does a fine job of giving a sense of the beginnings of the American literary tradtion (and its too easy to overlook the Puritans and the writing of the Founding Fathers as an English major).  I still don't understand how he can justify putting James Fenimore Cooper's Deerslayer and Charlotte Temple on the reading list while not including a thing from Edgar Allen Poe.  Also, I'm not sure what the point is to devoting a lecture and a half to Moby Dick when he doesn't even assign it.  A class with both postive and negatives... but, again, worthwhile overall... non-English majors should approach with caution.\nWorkload:\nNot bad.

Much of the class is historically-based, and Delbanco takes great care in drawing the class into the time period during which each text was written and explains the progression of literature from the Puritans to novelists of the 19th Century (particuluarly Melville, Delbanco's love).  Some of the reading can be a bit dry, but Delbanco's lectures and the mandatory discussion sections led by TAs make them worthwhile--Delbanco shows that there is always something valuable in even the driest texts, if not in the writing itself, in the history behind it.   \nWorkload:\nVaries between very heavy and very light reading, but Delbanco and the TAs are very understanding.
