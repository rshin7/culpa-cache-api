            "review_content": "\nAnja is an amazingly enthusiastic teacher. Sometimes I wondered where her enthusiasm came from when she was teaching a group of just 10 students, most of whom were just taking German to fulfill their language requirement. Her accent is perfect and she actually manages to make German sound nice. Her teaching style is very much by-the-book and if you don't like being taught like you're in grammar school, don't take her class. Sometimes you will feel like she's talking to you as if you're five years old. Other than that, her class is a lot of fun. You will learn a lot from her. \nWorkload:\nEasy. Very, very easy. Mid-terms and finals are a piece of cake. Just do the daily homework and you'll ace the class.\n"

            "review_content": "\nAnja is a good teacher. You may not like her, and you may not think she is too smart, but she knows how to teach. Her German is impecable. She is a native from Berlin, tall, blonde hair, blue eyes, etc. Classes were generally amusing, and the work assigned was always relevant. \nWorkload:\nNot bad at all. You might want to spend some extra time reviewing grammar and vocabulary...because we don't do much in class. No midterm, and no final. Some projects and presentations, and an oral exam, but all in all it's easy, and if you think german is amusing, a lot of fun.\n"
