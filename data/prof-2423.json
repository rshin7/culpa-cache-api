He knows a huge amount about techniques and materials and how to use them traditionally and non-traditionally.  He takes his students' work seriously, and is generally supportive-- occasionally, in my opinion, too generous.  However, his criticism remains very perceptive and focused.  He doesn't try to push a stylistic or conceptual agenda unlike some professors here, yet he can respond with clarity to many approaches.  He is also sort of hilarious... in a tucked-in shirt jazz-cat stoner style.  In his humble way, he is one of the best art professors I've had (which says a lot).  \nWorkload:\nself-directed\n"
