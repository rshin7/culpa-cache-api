            "review_content": "\nConsider yourself lucky if you are able to take a class with Professor Rosenthal. Despite the lack of info about him on CULPA, he has been at Columbia for decades (as evidenced by the fact that he has his own WikiCu page), and is certainly one of the best, if not the best, LitHum professors in the College. He has at one time or another been an Associate Dean, a professor, and a well-established author. He very much believes in the value of the Core and liberal education in general, and tries to allow students to learn in an environment with as little busy work as possible. His class discussions were interesting and he is very kind and approachable. In fact, to get the most out of this class, definitely show up to his office hours. He is one of the wisest advisors at Columbia and has some interesting stories to tell as well.  \nWorkload:\nHe gives 3 reasonable papers, a midterm, and a final. He is a moderate grader (and will certainly comment harshly on papers), but grades very holistically in the end. Read the books carefully and contribute intelligently in class and you will almost certainly earn a grade in the A range.\n"
