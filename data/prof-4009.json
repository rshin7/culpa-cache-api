            "review_content": "\nRon is an extremely nice guy but the class was boring. It was only two hours a week but it was literally 2 straight hours of boring powerpoint slides about drug development and regulation.  He tries to be funny and it is really endearing but there really isn't any way to make the material engaging.  The class was also basically all biotech grad students and some phD students.  With that being said, Ron does know the material really well and is well versed on the ins and outs of the pharmaceutical industry.  He also is really friendly and is happy to talk to any student. \nIt's easy to do well in this class but you should be ready to be bored for two hours.\nWorkload:\nThe workload was really light.  You're told to read the first 4 chapters of the tb and some random articles but that's not really necessary.  He assigns 3 continuous assessments which were really easy and straight forward.  They do help you understand and think more critically about the pharmaceutical industry.  The last class is also when he splits the class into two sides (the FDA and drug company) and holds a mock meeting between the two over some made up drug issue.\n"
