            "review_content": "\nProfessor PoKempner did not make International Human Rights Law an enjoyable class to be in. It was difficult to follow her lecture style and she did not present much of the knowledge we were to know for the assignments in order to complete them properly. Additionally, she was constantly changing the syllabus and leaving class early or being late a few times, and had her husband teach instead of her once. Overall, if you do not have to take this class and actually want to learn, avoid it, and if you do have to take it, take it with a different professor. The human rights core classes at this school are a mess!\nWorkload:\nTwo 1-2 page assignments, one quiz, 12-15 page final paper.\n"
