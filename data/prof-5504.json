It was his first year teaching so it is kind of understandable, but he is not the best teacher out there. You do learn stuff, though.\nIf you can speak Chinese, try asking him in Chinese. It might help.\nMidterms were managable but the final almost killed me. \nHe doesn't give formulas for midterms, so make sure you know those formulas in the book, even the ones that don't look like you can memorize. \nWorkload:\nreasonable amount of hwk due every Thu. They are not unreasonable, and they are perfectly doable until u reach Talyor series. I recommend buying student solutions manual. \ntwo midterms (or was it three?) and one final with nice curve. Don't worry if you fail the final.\n"
