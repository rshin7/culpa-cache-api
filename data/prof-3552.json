            "review_content": "\nProfessor Soni teaches from slides that he did not create and often does not know what he's talking about. However, he has a lot of experience in industry and knows a lot about the history of communications and about different standards etc.\nHis lack of understanding and mathematical knowledge is often embarrassing. Also, he will promise to answer your emails but never will. The tests are mainly reasonable except for the questions he makes a mistake on.\n\nWorkload:\n~1 assignment a week. Although he knew the entire class had the solutions manual, the problems were from the book and solutions (from the manual) were comically posted on the website.\n"
