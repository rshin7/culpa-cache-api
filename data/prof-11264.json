She makes class interesting and very fun to attend.  We learned a lot about Italian opera, art and culture while we were able to stay on task in terms of grammar.\nShe is a fair grader and is willing to meet with her students if they do not fully understand a topic.  \nDefinitely take her class if you can! \n\nWorkload:\nFair. Ideally a few hours per week of study.  1 quiz per week, 4 compositions per semester, and 1 oral presentation. \n"
