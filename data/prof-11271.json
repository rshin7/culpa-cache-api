He is incredibly chill, quite funny, down to earth and very engaging. He has that amazing ability of pretending that anything you say is worthwhile even when it's clearly not, and he doesn't particularly care whether you do the readings or not. ArtHum isn't exactly the most stimulating or interesting curriculum, and yes you will probably be bored at some point or another, but since you have to take it, Patch is definitely the guy you want to have as an instructor. Definitely worth taking this class with him. He's a gem. Do it.\n\nWorkload:\nin class midterm, 2 papers, 1 final project which was pretty entertaining and not too time consuming.\n"
