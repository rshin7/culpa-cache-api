            "review_content": "\nI echo the previous reviewer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sentiments -- Michaela is an awful professor. I cannot think of a single student who had a positive experience in her class. I will concede that Michaela, a Harvard graduate, is extremely smart and well qualified to teach this course. However, she is snarky, malicious, and arrogant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a fellow student described her as the reincarnation of pure evil. She treats Art Humanities as a Ph. D. level course and expects far too much from her students. Clearly not having learned from her past mistakes, during one class she gave out her cell phone number to several male students in her class (including two football players) and told them to text her. \nWhile Michaela may appear outwardly nice, she is in fact extremely obnoxious and elitist. On one occasion, she emailed all the students one of the papers she wrote during her time at Harvard undergrad, bragging that it was selected as the best paper in a large class. Furthermore, she said that we students are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kidding ourselves\u00e2\u20ac\u009d if we expect to get an A-range grade on our final paper at an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ivy league, world-renowned, top-notch university\u00e2\u20ac\u009d without first consulting art history books. These books are hidden deep in the recesses of Avery Library and I would not be surprised if they have been untouched for decades.\nAvoid Michaela like the plague if you want a positive experience in Art Humanities. The only positives about the course are that Michaela regularly lets class out early and cancels class every few weeks.\n\nWorkload:\nIncredibly high for an Art Humanities course. While there is no midterm or final, there are 5 papers, one of which must be 8-10 pages, plus discussion questions that must be emailed to her almost every class. In order to complete 3 of the papers, you must visit a museum. Plus, you have to attend 2 mandatory field trips.\nGrading is rather unjust.\n\n"

She gave everyone C's on the term paper, and nearly failed everyone on the final exam. She went to Harvard undergrad and needs to prove her worth, she's really rude and I can't believe she hit on a guy in our class. SHE'S AWFUL!\nWorkload:\n attendence/participation, one 2 page paper, one term paper 8 pgs, one midterm, one final\n"
