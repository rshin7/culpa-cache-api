She is unusually responsive to our questions and very responsive to our discussion board posts, prompt in grading assignments and exams, and dedicated to teaching the course.  However, even though she tried she could not always answer questions about fine points of the subject material--we had to send these questions to the professor.  In assignments, she also overlooked correct answers at times, so her work sometimes needed to be regraded.  Her explanations, when she had them, were quite clear.\nWorkload:\nN/A--Lakshmi was not responsible for this part of the course.\n"
