            "review_content": "\nGuo is a very nice and a very understanding teacher, and he loves to give the students life and career advice, as well as recount stories of his own life. However, this seems to be all he likes to do. His teaching style is dodgy at best, and you will have an extremely difficult time following along in lecture (this is not helped by the 2.5 hour long class time, though he does let you out early pretty often). Unless you are very comfortable with mechanics, and are familiar with a good bit of continuum mechanics, this class will be a morass of confusing notations, unclear notes, and frustrating study periods. Many a time we would sit down to study as a group, look around, and realize none of us had any idea what to do. It's not a good class by any means, and I have learned very little from it.\nWorkload:\nA problem set every two weeks or so, but make sure you start early so you can go to his office hours whenever possible. The 2 exams are pretty much out of the problem sets, so study those.\n"
