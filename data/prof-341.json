            "review_content": "\nShort Prose forms is an amazing class.  It's a hybrid between a seminar and workshop, so you get to read and submit.  Even better, Professor Ziegler lets you lead your own workshop, so you get to ask the questions you really want, really get to the issues about your work that interest/bother you.  This is the ONLY class in the undergraduate creative writing department that is taught by a Professor whose specialty is the content of the class.  Professor Ziegler knows a ton about short prose, and now I know a ton about short prose.  I couldn't be more pleased\nWorkload:\nIt's heavy, but worth it.  2 in-class submissions, lots of weekly reading, 5 exercises to be done on your own time (he gives you a list with about 15 options, you pick the exercises that speak to you), and a journal on the readings.\n"

He comes off as very caring and tries to draw out what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best in your writing. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help enjoying this class and teacher. And he worked with Vonnegut! Really wish I could take another course with Ziegler.\nWorkload:\nResponses to short readings, unchecked journal entries, a few writing exercises, a play, two short stories revised for the final portfolio\n"

Workshops are actually helpful, and he's very careful about maintaining a nice balance between student comments and his own. Not only does he know his stuff, he's also really laidback and very concerned about his students' writing, making sure that each student keeps to their own personal style. He is by far the best teacher I've come across in the Writing Department and if you have the chance to take a class with him, your writing will definitely improve and you'll have fun in the process.\nWorkload:\nFive short workshopped pieces and five writing exercises\n"
