Audrey was actually a pretty good professor, and was exceptionally nice during office hours, which is why I felt compelled to post. It was pretty easy to figure out her style and build my papers around that, which resulted in an A+ (my first A+ at Columbia, despite being an econ major). People do participate quite extensively in class, but judging from the friends I took the class with as well as myself, Audrey actually grades pretty leniently with participation as long as you at least talk once each class. Most of my friends and me ended up with A's, despite being not musically inclined. \nWorkload:\nAbout average for music hum. Spent about 30 mins skimming readings each week, and around 10 hours per paper. \n"

Really bad class.\nWorkload:\nAverage workload, class participation: ridiculous\n"
