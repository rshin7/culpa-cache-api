His grading was arbitrary. He didn't give really any grades back until the very end of the semester, so no one had any idea how well they were doing in the class. His teaching was confusing and when the class didn't understand, he didn't take the time to make it more clear. The class was a disaster.\nWorkload:\nNormal for a language class\n3 Compositions\nMidterm/Final\nParticipation\nHomework Online and in textbook\n"
