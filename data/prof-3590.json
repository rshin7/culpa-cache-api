Marcia is an excellent teacher who does a great job of switching between instructing us about the books and letting us discuss them and their overarching themes.  She will agree with any opinion as long as you give her a good argument and enough support. To show how easy-going and cool she is, listen to this: she entertained the idea of The Dark Knight being the modern equivalent of the Iliad.\nMake sure that you read because if the class discussion starts to lose steam, she will start calling on random people to use their discussion questions.  I recommend that if you take her class, you sit in the front row because she's soft-spoken and hard to hear sometimes.\nWorkload:\ndefinitely lighter than most Lit Hum classes: 3 papers (the first two were 3-5, the last was 2-4!), daily discussion questions which are basically a little paragraph to show you read\n"
