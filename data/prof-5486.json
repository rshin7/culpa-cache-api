            "review_content": "\nProfessor Lu, what can I say.  During the first part of the semester, it was a bit of a challenge understanding her teaching style and accent.  For the students who have stuck it out, however, they will probably tell you that she is an amazing teacher who knows what she's talking about.  While she has a tendency to rush through the lessons she will gladly explain the underlying concept if a student is struggling.  All her examples are worked out on the board and can also be found in the textbook.  She also tells her students jokes, which are silly, but a nice break from 2.5 hours of straight math.  Her quizzes and tests can be tricky, but if one studies and does the homework,  they shouldn't be a problem.  Overall, I would recommend Professor Lu for those who have to take a mathematics course.\nWorkload:\nWeekly homework, intermittent quizzes, a midterm, and final exam.  \n"
