She isn't an amazingly great lecturer, but she is clear and thorough. Pros: 25% of grade is participation and no midterm. Cons: NOT a particularly easy grader and takes attendance\nWorkload:\n1 6-8 page paper, 5 short response papers + required online bulletin board patricipation. Final. Lots of reading, but none of it is exceedingly difficult.\n"
