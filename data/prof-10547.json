He was able to bond with and understand all of his students, which is something that is so important in an art fundamentals course. He is never harsh or mean unless it is called for, and he always pushes you in the direction he knows will be best for you and your ideas. He sees the potential in all his students and helps them work on and build it. \nI'm so thankful I took this class with him, because it was the best class and experience I've had at Columbia. \nWorkload:\nsyllabus said ~5 projects - 1 box and 1 project for wood, 1 project for foam, 1 box and 1 project for metal, but he ended up cutting the metal box, and around 10 minute in class presentation on an artist \n"
