            "review_content": "\nGil had an interesting teaching style. He always asked for questions at the beginning of lecture, but didn't always seem to get around to answering them. He just kind of talked about what he had planned and then if something was related to a question, would point that out. I guess he took questions to encourage participation, but I had no motivation to ask a question because I didn't think it would be answered. Pretty much everything he said was interesting, though.\nTOO MUCH reading. There weren't many assignments so reading was basically the only thing we had to do, but it was impossible to get through it all. I ended up doing very little of it on a weekly basis and then doing what was necessary for the midterm and final paper.\nThe only reason I'm hesitant to say I'd recommend is because Gil added an attendance policy after the drop deadline, and students could only miss 2 classes. That was pretty annoying for someone who hadn't been missing very often, but wanted the option when necessary. \nWorkload:\nA lot of weekly reading\nMidterm paper on 3 readings\nFinal take-home paper\n"

His lectures appear to be improvised, and are usually based off of whatever questions from students he can scrounge up--promulgated usually by the 25% of your grade that comes from class participation.\nThe texts are exceedingly difficult and his lectures have to be reflected upon, but if you're willing to really think about them it's probably worth your time. The review sessions held before the midterm and the final by TAs were essential to understanding the course, but attendance is also important--even though at times it feels futile.\nHe said in one class, and it became a theme, \"it is impossible to evaluate a class until five years after it ends,\" so perhaps this review is futile. That's kind of how the whole thing goes, anyway.\nWorkload:\nTwo papers, a midterm and a final, written in 24 hours for between 8 and ten pages. A challenge, but graded by the TAs.\n"

What I did get however was a well instructed lecture. Here's How Professor Aninijar runs things:\nFirst, he comes in and trys to get everyone that is in the class to get an easy A to peace out, but being incredibly boring the first two classes.\nAfter the drop deadline, and half of the class vacated, he starts instructing. He does so by mentioning some news article or current event. This story, that is articulated very casually, is then used as an anchor exhibit for say.. Foucalt, or some other reading we are focusing on that week. \nWe did'nt cover a rolodex of the world religions in this class because as the class trys to communicate, the dividing done to these religions, filed away in these nice names, is a warp on religion itself. \nSomething to know before taking this professor's classes: He does not give a flying f*ck about what your idea of a \"normal\" course is, or how bad it will ruffle your feathers to do something out of the box. \n\nWorkload:\nLIGHT\n"

The reading list includes some books that relate to religion and many that do not.  The goal of the course is to rethink the way we consider religion and to \"relinquish religion,\" but the majority of the class time was spent not analyzing religion or actually learning anything, but rather discussing bits and pieces of the books and then getting majorly sidetracked.  Although Professor Anidjar knows his material and is a wealth of information, the course failed to actually teach anything substantial.  About half the class didn't even bother coming to lecture, and I found myself often needing to drink coffee to avoid falling asleep in class.\nWorkload:\nEasy.  The syllabus outlines about fifteen books, or a book a week, but you can get by without really reading any of them.  If you skim a chapter or so of a few books you'll be fine.  Two papers (5-6 pages each) relating various non-religious ideas to religion.  \n"

We did not study Judaism, Christianity, or Buddhism, but rather spent class time having (granted entertaining) irrelevant discussions on books that no one in class read. The books cost me over 300 dollars and I read at most a chapter out of each one because it is not necessary and they were all quite long. There was no motivation to read, or even come to class for that matter since attendance was not taken-- even though it counted for a third of our grade? The discussions were very interesting, and the professor is clearly brilliant, but I didn't feel like I learned anything other than how to see religion in different ways (as sexual difference, law, ect.). Interesting in theory but a rather disappointing class in terms of taking away any kind of learning experience. One positive thing is that Gil really makes you think and often asked the class to ask questions that could not be answered; however, this does not constitute an entire course. Global core, woohoo.\nWorkload:\nRather light, only a take home midterm and take home final. Five-six pages on a prompt he provides in class. Consists mainly of write about what religion means without thinking about it in terms of specific religions, but rather equating religion to other entities. \n"

The only written assignment for the class was a final 10-12 page paper which required students to pick one paragraph from any of the texts we had laboriously and repeatedly read, and show how it means (through explication). \nThe class and the professor are both highly recommended because there is no bullshit--how rare!\nWorkload:\nAnidjar asked that we come to the second week of class having read all of the texts (of which there were perhaps 10).

His strongest point is also his weakest:  he seems to believe that reading should be a slow and painful process.  The effort can be both endlessly rewarding and draining, and not always successful (nor, I suppose, should it be).  Prof. Anidjar adds new dimension to the phrase \"too cool for school\" and takes himself entirely too seriously (and yet, he is the most caustically sarcastic man I've ever met).
