Very relaxed guy, explains the material very clearly and will go over it as much as possible, this is a VERY easy lab. When there was a death on campus, Ari extended our final reports several times, as well as encouraged us to defer the report if we needed to. Yes this is a boring lab, but you often get out early and it's not hard to get an A as long as you write the lab reports the way you're supposed to. one of the easiest labs I've ever taken. \nWorkload:\nOnce a week write of of a portion of a lab report (so intro one week, results the next week) and then a final lab report\n"

            "review_content": "\nReally nice guy - intro to psych is a super easy class. He tests mostly on the lecture so you don't need to read the textbook at all. Quizzes are multiple choice and straight from his slides and lecture. As long as you pay attention in class you can pass without a problem. I highly recommend for a course that won't give you a headache.\nAlso gives off for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur if that's relevant to you \nWorkload:\n5 quizzes throughout the semester. Super basic multiple choice questions. Even offers extra credit to boost quiz scores! \n"
