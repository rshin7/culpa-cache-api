Stiglitz was fascinating to listen to... unfortunately he never attended class (probably had more important engagements considering his fame).  This left Brendan O'Flaherty to lecture who is just awful -- painfully boring and useless since he oversimplifies everything which left me feeling lost on the midterm and final.  Discussion section weekly which is semi-helpful.  Almost everyone says Principles is a class where you have to \"teach yourself\" so if you can do that, take this class.  Otherwise, steer clear!!!!\nWorkload:\nweekly problem sets, midterm, final\n"
