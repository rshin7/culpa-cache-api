I loved Prof. Russell, and I don't think she's disorganized at all. There's a huge value to her madness. I would suggest typing your notes for this class, though if you are to keep up and keep everything organized. Russell truly engages you with the major ideas and concepts and makes it so easy to comprehend. If you think you know American politics, you don't until you take this class. There's a lot of reading, but it's very valuable, especially the textbook with snippets from major political science works. It integrates arguments nicely with class lectures. You can speed read the other textbook and take down key terms, especially for the ID section on the midterm and final. Otherwise, you'll get the bulk of what you need from Prof. Russell. My TA was also great. His name was Steven White and he efficiently helped us to understand the main points of the weekly readings. Overall this class was great and I did really well.TBH I actually fell asleep a couple times during the final because I was so sleep deprived from finals week, but it appears I killed the final. Take this class.\nWorkload:\n10%- Attendance: Write your name on a signup sheet every class \n30%- Midterm- 5 out of 8 ID's, 1 short essay & one long essay (nothing surprising on the exam, and if you don't do well, it's kind of shameful)\n30%- Paper: 8-10 pages about ANYTHING you want relating to american politics \n30%- Final: A bit extended version of the midterm. You have more ID options to choose from, and you have a couple more short-essay analysis and a long essay\n"

This is *not* a repeat of AP Gov from high school -- you're not learning how a bill gets passed or things like that. Russell likes to talk about the theory behind how government works.\nShe does have a political agenda, and this is made very clear to you by the end of the first lecture, and it does carry through her lectures. If you're not liberal, you might not like this. Either drop the class and take it with someone else, or bite the bullet and take it with Russell.\nAttendance is mandatory in both lectures and discussion sections, and Russell is fanatical about this -- there is an attendance sheet that circulates every lecture, and the TAs all take attendance in section.\nWorkload:\nMidterm, 8-10 page research paper on a topic of your choice, and a final exam. Attendance is MANDATORY -- there is a sign-in sheet that circulates every lecture that you have to sign. All grading is done by your TA.\n"

Professor Russell is a nice person and she is always readily available in office hours but man her lectures were crazy! Best way put, she \"shotguns\" her material, she goes all over the place and goes a mile a minute, multiple times a lecture I would ask myself \"is this really important to be writing down?\"  Her midterm wasnt too bad, if you went to class and actually paid attention somewhat.  I felt like she over prepared us for the midterm.  The paper wasn't too bad either, literally there was no topic, it just had to be about American politics and be somewhat relevant to what we were talking about.  Haven't taken the final yet but I have heard its similar to the midterm.  Also i feel like she is giving us subliminal messages to watch House of Cards and The West Wing and she said King Joffrey died the day after when half the class hadn't watched the latest GOT episode HA! \nIn conclusion, is this a good class? No, it's really dry,  She has potential but I think she has taught this class too much she has lost her magic.  However, this class isn't awful, its just one of those classes you need to bite the bullet and just get it over with.  You could definitely have a worse teacher for this subject \nWorkload:\n10%- Attendance: Write your name on a signup sheet every class\n30%- Midterm- 5 out of 8 ID's and a few essays.: Easy midterm if you came to class and paid attention\n30%- Paper: 8-10 pages about ANYTHING you want relating to american politics\n30%- Final: Haven't taken it yet but heard its similar to midterm\n"

The readings are heavy and dry (which is silly, because there are so many AMAZING American poli sci readings), and the things she wants you to glean from them are really not consistent or relevant. \nShe seems like one of those people who is so intelligent that her thoughts come out scattered, as if her brain is speeding ahead at 500 mph and her mouth is sputtering out the bits she remembers. I think she might be better in a seminar, but in a lecture setting she's unfocused, repetitive, and doesn't answer questions.\nThe TAs are alright, they're kind of constrained by the dullness of the course.\nRussell is very liberal, which she is upfront about, and she often points out that she is providing a liberal take on issues - but she often completely glosses over important conservative elements. She's very impassioned about West Wing and House of Cards, and while I appreciate that she tries to connect with students over these topics, she sometimes goes on tangents for half the class, but still expects you to know all the things she didn't talk about for the final.\nWorkload:\nA lot of reading, a paper, a midterm, a final, a discussion section.

And by far the most accessible. When she says she loves to talk to students she actually means it.\nAnd yes, she does help with internships. For me, she not only wrote a rec letter, she actually called the senator office and made sure I got it. I LOVE YOU JUDITH RUSSELL. (I'd marry you if I was a bit older and/or straight) \nAs for the class: \nIt's a really nice class. It's not challenging or hard. It's a good overview and intro to American politics. As an international student, I was really interested, I assume that for most Americans this is stuff you already know... But still, the material is interesting, the readings are good, and professor Russell sometimes adds lectures on things like affirmative action which I found fascinating.\nParticipation is a must. But for realz, she says it in the first lecture. If you think you won't be able to handle attending every class then just DROP THE FUCKING COURSE. Don't come here bitching about it.\nThis was the first year that the exam was in class. I assume she's gonna keep doing it. But the exam is fair, if you attended class (and actually listened), and did the readings, you'll be fine.\nThe discussion sections are ok, depends on who your TA is, but from what I heard they're all kinda good.\nWorkload:\n30% Midterm - This year it was in class. Fair stuff, pick 5 ID's out of 8, choose one of two short essay questions, and one mandatory essay question.\n30% Final - Same as midterm\n30% - Research paper - about 10 pages.

Having taken her Intro class and worked with her in other capacities, she is one of the most knowledgeable people I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve met on American politics today and historically, as well as on the American political science literature. Professor Russell has a superb understanding of the Founding Fathers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 thinking. You leave her class with a real grounding in the core thinkers who shaped the American political system. She also assigns thought provoking articles with differing interpretations about fundamental issues like the framing of the constitution and the role of the judiciary. Another wonderful aspect is that Professor Russell really pushes students to explore their individual interests and works with them to achieve that end. Further, she is excellent as an editor and as someone to bounce ideas off of, always adding valuable insight. Professor Russell is also an exceptionally supportive faculty member who goes above and beyond for her students. She is remarkable as a professor and as a mentor. Columbia is lucky to have her. Take her courses and get to know her\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit is absolutely worth it.\nWorkload:\nClass participation, take-home midterm, research paper and in-class final exam.

            "review_content": "\nI completely agree and understand with how polar these previous reviews seem to be.\nFor the first few lectures with Prof. Russell, I was convinced I had made a terrible mistake. She always begins lectures about 10 to 15 minutes late, and every other lecture ends about an extra 5 or 10 minutes early. Moreover, her lectures are messy, she stomps her feet and moves around a lot (which can be very distracting), and writes completely illegibly on the blackboard. She is repetitive, and takes constant breaks to try and figure out where she herself is in the material. Lastly, at a point the class feels rushed, because she takes days discussing some topics early in the semester, then struggles to catch up towards the end. It also doesn't help that she includes some random lectures on affirmative action and other topics that, while interesting, are not completely relevant and (not being in the syllabus) delay the class even further.\nHaving said that though, I quickly realized I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS WOMAN. She is possibly the MOST approachable professor on campus; she truly makes an effort to get to know her students, and encourages us all to visit her for office hours. Eventually, you realize that her lectures are actually a lot better connected and relevant to each other than you first thought. Sure, she's still messy and she could definitely both streamline her material and cover a lot more of it if she were slightly more efficient. Nevertheless, at the end of the class you realize you've learned a *lot* more than you ever expected. Many come into this class thinking it's just another American politics class covering the same basics: Constitution, Madisonian model, blablabla. And it is. But you learn SO much more about all of these topics than you ever had, and you learn to look at it all through a very different perspective. The readings are a bit excessive sometimes (for one class, we basically had to read an entire book, plus a couple of articles and other chapters), but they're not absolutely essential (especially if you have a good TA). If you do them though, they are actually extremely useful and very interesting. Lastly, she is a great contact for internships and just as an all-around, fantastic, epic woman.\nIf you can, TAKE DR. RUSSELL'S CLASS. She is a great person, you learn a lot more than you expected, and at the end of the day you'll realize you're really going to miss her lectures (no matter how much they *can* improve). It's tough to sum her up because she really is the definition of a hot mess. But in the end, you'll look back on her class and realize how much you've learned, what a great resource she can be (internships, interviews, other classes' projects, etc.), and how much you'll miss her lectures.\nWorkload:\n1 midterm (30%, easy), one 10 page paper (30%, moderate to hard), one final (30%, easy to moderate).\n"

            "review_content": "\nI feel like some of the other reviewers and I must have been taught by completely different people. This is my second consecutive semester in a JR class - last semester I took Politics of American Policymaking (I'm doing it backwards, I know). She is the second-best professor I've had at Columbia. She would be the best, but Dean Awn's Islam class is absolutely amazing and anyone who hasn't taken it should get into it ASAP. \nAnyway, here's the deal with Professor Russell: attendance in class is mandatory. So I suspect that is what drives a lot of the negativity about her. But really, it's not that big a deal. Go to class. Her lectures are generally very interesting. She has a real gift for explaining the forces behind some of the biggest events in US political history. She has a good sense of humor and she insists that her students keep up on current events, often bringing in clippings from the day's newspaper or recent magazine articles and reading them to highlight how the issues we're talking about are still relevant.\nShe's a good lecturer, but I think the best part about Prof. Russell is how much she cares about her students. Go to her office hours, email her, ask her a question before or after class - she will give you her full, undivided attention. She doesn't forget about people (well, sometimes she does, but when it happens she's extremely apologetic and then works twice as hard to take care of their issue). If you ask her one question, send her one email, or visit her office hours one time, she will know your name for the rest of your life. She'll help students find internships, help them find sources for their research papers, or just give you her thoughts on whatever topics you might be interested in. I never waited more than 24 hours for a response to an email. Several times she responded - with solid answers - in minutes. She is, of the professors I've met, hands-down the one who cares most about her students. The class is worth taking if only as a reason to meet Judith Russell and have her as someone whose knowledge you can tap into for the rest of your time at Columbia. \nThe class itself is easy. I'll get to that in workload, I guess. Anyway, I highly recommend this class or any Judith Russell class.\nWorkload:\nMidterm, final, research paper. The midterm was take-home, so if you don't do extremely well on it, you have no one to blame but yourself. The final is in-class but pretty darn easy if you've been to class (which you have, because attendance is mandatory). The research paper is a little tougher in that its constraints are pretty nebulous, but everyone seems to have done well on the papers so my guess is they're not graded very hard. Or else we're all just really smart. But it's probably that they're not graded that hard.\nMandatory attendance that counts for 10% of grade (but don't think you can just not show up and lose out on the 10%, as some people tried this semester. She noted that she can toss people from the class if they miss more than 25%. Anyway, just GO TO CLASS. It's twice a week for an hour and fifteen minutes at a time. The lectures are interesting. It's not hard.). Mandatory attendance at weekly discussion sections.\n"

Columbia was supposed to be a magical, political place perfect for someone like me, and having come from a high school were no government courses were offered, I was extremely excited to see what Columbia had to offer.\nGranted, as a jaded sophomore today, I now realize that those unreasonably high expectations were... well, stupid. But I never imagined I would be as utterly disappointed with a poli sci class as I was with Russell's Intro to American Politics. This lady probably knows a lot. But she is a simply atrocious lecturer. Her lectures are basically a series of highly disorganized ramblings punctuated with illegible scrawlings on the blackboard. She almost always loses track of time due to her ranting and as a result we never ended up covering all the promised topics on the syllabus. Listening to her speak is painful and bewildering; it is hard to tell when she is making an important point and when she is simply going on a tangent. She jumps from subject to subject. I believe that Russell is passionate about the subject matter, but that makes it even more bewildering as to why she is unable to convey a coherent message. \nI do't believe I am alone in feeling this; looking around the room almost everyone else with a laptop is on Gmail, Facebook, or is doing other class assignments. Anyone without a laptop is doodling or slumped over the desk in defeat. It is terrible that Russell takes daily attendance; it's the only reason why people keep coming back. If she dropped the attendance sheet system, nobody would come. The TAs are absolutely useless and barely know anything; discussion sections are just a smaller, more awkward version of class. Overall, it is really unfortunate that this crucial, required class is such a drag. I'll still probably stick with political science for now under the hopes that higher level classes (or Barnard Poli Sci courses) are more interesting - but as for this one? It sucks. Stay away.\nWorkload:\nRequired attendance. A not-too hard 10-page take home midterm paper. Final: a 10-page research paper (topic of your choice); final exam featuring IDs. \n"

The material is not difficult at all, pretty basic US Gov stuff, and the TAs were awesome. Amy and David (I didn't have much to do with Zach) probably taught more PoliSci than Russell did, and saved the grades of dozens of students. Russell assigns a zillion readings, most of which aren't necessary, and if you have a good TA they'll tell you what's important to know and what's not. The midterm was take-home which was great and the research paper and final were mostly harmless. She gives you an enormous list of IDs beforehand and if you know that list, you'll ace the final.

The entire time spent in class was extremely tedious (particularly at 9 in the morning), and I gained nothing from the material (or lack thereof).

Come finals time, I had a bit of studying to do, but fortunately she gives you a list of IDs ahead of time (granted, 100+).  I put the paper off as well which was a huge mistake and resulted with me getting a low grade considering the material, so be aware.  One of the worst parts of this class is that there was a pointless discussion section led by a non-American who had never studied American politics or even poli sci in general before.  We had to do short presentations on the readings, which were not usually that relevant to the course.  In the end, I regretted the hours of life I wasted on this useless course.

Professor Russell's lectures are very tangential & make no sense & she comes off as very arrogant.  However, outside of class, she is one of the nicest & most caring professors I have ever had.  I was able to talk to her several times about my research paper & she actually seemed interested & willing to help.  She even came up to me one day before class & asked me how it was going.  The workload is very doable.  The reading is the lightest of any polsci class I have had and you can easily do it all right before the midterm paper & final exam.  The midterm is a little annoying because it is 2 5 page essays on the reading that she expects back in a week after handing them out.  However, I had no problem getting it done while working on them on & off for 2 weekdays in between stuff for other classes.  The paper is no big deal: 7-10 pages of research on anything you want that has anything to do with the class.  You have plenty of room to be creative.  The final seemed very intimidating because of the study sheet that had about 100 random terms that usually did not come from the lectures (even though Russell swore they all did) & often garnered only a passing mention in the reading if that.  However, the exam did not seem to be taken from this list for the most part & you can do well just by coming to lecture & going through your notes.  There is a voluntary discussion section, but don't go.  The TAs were totally worthless.  They came from unrelated departments & did not seem to have a grasp on the material themselves.  If you have any questions/problems, it is definitely much more worthwhile to go to Professor Russell (especially on the paper) & she is more than willing to help.  \nWorkload:\nextremely light reading 2 5 page take home midterm essaysfinal\n"

I can't urge you enough to STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS, it will ruin the poli-sci department for you.   \nWorkload:\ntons of reading, a shot-in-the-dark midterm (demanded far more information than her lectures provided or even alluded to), 10-page paper, final\n"

However...the woman does not know how to give a lecture to save her life. Her public speaking skills are awful. She says \"UM\" like 500 times in an hour and a half class. She does not know how to engage her students and you'll probable fall asleep in the first 15mins. It's actually quiet sad that she has all that knowledge and can't properly convey it to students. \nWorkload:\nOne 10 page take home midterm, one 10 page final paper, in class final as well and a bunch of reading\n"

Despite the fact that she knows some stuff in American politics, she can't lecture for shit. Her thousands of \"ums\" are just plain annoying. Her strict attendance policy, which is only 10% of the grade is just way too ridiculous. She takes the attendance very seriously and personally, but everything she does in class is straight out of the reading. She also assigns way too many outdated books from the 70s. BE SURE TO SIGN THE ATTENDANCE SHEET!!  \nWorkload:\nOne term-paper, 8-10 pages. Midterm and Final. The midterm of Fall 2003 was way way way too long, it was THREE essays. \n"

Her skill in and passion for this subject area are truly inspiring, and the subject matter of the class is interesting indeed. However, Prof. Russell's intellect doesn't necessarily translate into lecturing skills...her lectures are full of \"uhms\" and \"uhs\" and if a student gets her off topic she might stay off topic for quite a while. They're worth attending mostly b/c she doesn't regurgitate the readings so it's mostly new material...and from time to time very interesting speakers come in.  The work isn't ridiculous....midterm, final, one ten page paper...but you get an attendance grade (for a 9am class, I suppose I understand)...readings are mandatory-and there are many- but all of them interesting, and the TAs were amazingly helpful.\nWorkload:\nmidterm, final, 1 ten page paper...mandatory attendence (grade given) and discussion section 1x per week\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Russel cannot lecture for s**t. Her notes aren't an outline, just 2 pages of solid words that make sense to no one but her. Taking notes is a nightmare because of all the tangents and lack of organization, and I have a lot of trouble not falling asleep in the middle of taking notes at 9:10 in the morning. And she says \"um\" way more than should be humanly possible. The discussion sections are also awkward and silent, and not that productive. However! I still love this class, against all reason - I think the subject matter is incredible. So if you have a realy passion for urban issues and learning about them, it's worth getting through, but if not, you'll hate this class and want to throw your really expensive books at her everyday. And one-on-one she's a very nice person, and brilliant - one of the most well-read people I've ever met. She knows her s**t. \nWorkload:\nLots of reading, but you don't have to do it all. Midterm, final, 10 pp paper.\n"
