            "review_content": "\nSince the department seems to lag with making course evaluations public I think it is necessary for students to review classes on CULPA to hold the administration accountable.\nI think a review needs to be made to warn students about Professor Siddiqi's new Modern Architecture in the World architecture major requirement. If you think you are taking this class to learn about theory/ history relevant to your major you are going to be very disappointed. This class is a lot more about thinking critically about architecture history narratives and historiography which is great for what it is -- although I don't think it should be requirement, especially as a design major.\nI can't say that anyone in the class was a big fan of the Professor. Although some of her lectures could be interesting, she ended up rambling for large portions of the class on subjects that had very little to do with architecture (like mice in space). So if you're into that great, but if you're looking for something more straight forward I would stay clear.\n She is also not pleasant to interact with during office hours. I admire her scholarship but not her as a person. \nWorkload:\nHeavy because most of the time you have no idea what the assignment is even trying to accomplish.\n"
