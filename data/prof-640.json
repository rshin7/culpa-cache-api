Each week, our seminar ran an hour over, and he talked nearly the entire time.  He asked for response papers on most of the books.  The essay questions for the two papers ran two pages single spaced.  This is just his way; he complicates the course to make it much harder than it has to be.  He grades response papers, as an example, \"B/B-\" and says that grade really means \"A- or maybe even an A in some cases.\"  Response papers are said to be \"optional...if you want to be sure to get an A,\" but Prof. Mass grades by check marks and half check marks It's not clear how professor Mass grades, but if you're looking for the easy A or a certain opportunity to earn an A, avoid his classes because you'll be guessing till the end.\nWorkload:\nA classic novel, as \"Heart of Darkness,\" \"Ulysses,\" and \"Women in Love,\" every two weeks.\n"

Be prepared to listen carefully when you get to class though.

Likes it when you participate in class. Take the class! \nA note: If you enjoyed CC or philosophy, you will enjoy the modernist literature, since it is often about the search for meaning. \nWorkload:\nStandard workload for an English class.

The best part about this class is his passion: he loves what he is teaching, he knows a lot about it, and he truly desires to make these dense works accessible to his students. He is funny, erudite, willing to work with his students on deadlines, consistently available, and genuinely kind. He is exactly what you want/imagine in the perfect professor. I took this class because I wanted to read Ulysses in an academic setting-- Massimilla recognized the daunting intricacy of the work and endeavored to make it easier for his students. If all of this information weren't enough to persuade you to take a one-day-a-week-class on amazing works of literature, Professor Massimilla held one session at a restaurant near campus and paid for everyone's dinner! He PAID for dinner while we discussed James Joyce.\nIf he lectures at all, it is only because the class is really not long enough for the material it covers. And his lectures are always insightful and worthwhile. The workload is completely manageable for a class covering these books: 1 short essay on each work (essentially free response and not a lot to ask for a class that meets once a week) and 2 longer papers. \nThis class is amazing. The professor is amazing. I would take it again a hundred times.\nWorkload:\nReading, 1 weekly short response (1.5-2 pages), and 2 longer papers (~7 pages). \n"

The only complaint I have is that my hand was sore after taking notes each class, because every word out of his mouth was so valuable I did not want to risk forgetting a word of his lectures by not writing everything down.  Not that it is at all necessary to take frantic notes.  His workload is more than manageable, and the final exam was more than fair.  He is extremely approachable and his enthusiasm is contagious.  He is not only an incredibly valuable source of information, but he is always more than willing to help with anything from a paper topic to a simple question after class. I'm not sure where the negative reviews are coming from, but everyone I took the course with loved the class as much as I did. \nTAKE THIS CLASS!!!!\nWorkload:\nManageable, 2 papers and a final exam\n"

            "review_content": "\nI have to say that I disagree with the previous reviewer. I'm also a senior who took this seminar this past semester and I loved it. It's true that he does like to talk a lot (I always end up with my wrist spazzing out from all the notes I take), but he does allow students to interject with their opinions and whatnot, and he works at making it into a discussion. That was, at least for me, what those group projects were all about. Personally, it helped me focus and analyze whatever one theme our group decided on and get a sort of deeper understanding of the text, because we usually try to simultaneously cover depth and breadth which is a difficult task.\nThe extra thirty minutes thing wasn't really a problem for me... And I had to leave every week, without fail, exactly at 8:00 because I had somewhere else to run to. I just made a friend in the class, and we'd exchange notes if either one of us were absent, and when I would borrow her notebook, I would just make a copy of whatever bit I missed in the extra thirty minutes. It's just difficult because the texts we read are really dense (as all modernist texts are), and we do go through a fair share of books, so two hours a week really isn't enough. I certainly felt like time flew by when I was in class.\nI did miss a few classes, but I don't think he gave us any shit about it. He'd make a passing remark or something every now and then but that's just his sense of humor. I was never really offended by anything he'd said; maybe I'm just not as sensitive, I don't know. \nHe's never been slow with email responses with me, and really, if you take the time to talk to him after class or drop him an email asking for an extension with a valid kind of excuse, he's really nice about it. I know from previous classes with him also that he'd happily send you a really long email bouncing off ideas on a paper topic that you'd want to write about, if you take initiative.\nI can see how the sort of seeming \"structurelessness\" of his lecturing style (yes, he *does* lecture, but as I mentioned, he also opens up room for discussion) can be frustrating for some people, but when you read through your notes again carefully, it does actually make a lot of sense. It may not be chapter-for-chapter, but you slowly start to understand the structures that we're trying to cover. Which is, well, a great first step for modernist literature.\nIf there was one thing that I struggled with, it was containing three modernist texts into five pages for our papers! My second one, after endless edits, was finally cut down from it's original 12 page length to 7 pages...\nAnyways, the course syllabus is amazing, and there is a lot of reading (of course, it's a seminar after all) but all of it's interesting! You really get back as much as you put in in this seminar, and it was actually one of my favorite classes this semester, and I would recommend it to anyone -- don't be intimidated even if you aren't an English major! Really. Take this class. You won't regret it.\nWorkload:\nTwo five-page papers. A few one page responses to the text (he gives you a few guiding questions if you are absolutely stuck as to what to write). We go through one novel every two weeks (except for Ulysses, which we dedicated about three, four classes to). Group presentations (usually ~5 mins) are really stress-free. You just hang out with your group members/talk with them over email to figure out what you want to say for about 20 minutes.\n"

He is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about modernist fiction and poetry. The syllabus was great, and those group presentations often lend to interesting discussions. Prof Mass does have a tendency to fall into rambling lecture mode, but what he is saying is always worthwhile. I will say that he really should mention on the bulletin that he intends the class to be 6-8:30 instead of 6-8. Also, I think part of the reason he started lecturing so much is because he kind of overloaded his syllabus. Ulysses took up 4 classes and people started to lose focus by the end of it. He would do better to substitute it with one or two shorter, challenging works. I have found him to respond to emails within a day, which is not unusual for professors. As for the Passover/Jewish remarks situation--his remarks were not offensive at all.\nWorkload:\na few responses, 2 5-6 page papers\n"

            "review_content": "\nLet me just say that this is my first CULPA review, and I'm a senior.  I had such a horrible time in this class that I had to review him, and I'm honestly not sure how or why this professor is silver-starred.  And as a side-note, this review has nothing to do with the grade I've received in the course, as I did well throughout the semester.\nAs a disclaimer, this course is supposed to be a seminar, but for all intents and purposes, it's just 2 hours of Prof Mass (as he will have you call him) lecturing, and disorganized-ly at that.  He also failed to mention in his course description that he keeps his class 30 minutes extra after class, saying \"it's just optional,\" but really expecting you to stay.  And this class was on a Monday night from 6 to 8.  \nTo be fair, the syllabus was great (Ulysses, Heart of Darkness, the Good Soldier, Mrs. Dalloway, Women in Love, A Passage to India), and Prof Mass clearly knows his stuff.  However, he often rambled without providing us with any information, and he never facilitated class discussion.  When students would try to contribute, he would often interrupt them immediately and not let them finish a thought.  He would also then have us to these weird little group exercises during class in which we would divide into small groups for 10 minutes, discuss a topic of his choosing, and present to the rest of the class.  These were ultimately unhelpful and a waste of time.  \nAdditionally, he is not amenable to students missing class.  If you do miss a class, he requires you to write a response paper on the week's reading anyway, and if you miss handouts from a week you've missed and then ask for the missing handouts, he puts up a stink about you having missed that class.  He is also VERY slow to respond to emails, which I always think is frustrating.  On a completely different note, the course fell during Passover week, and Prof Mass made some rather offensive and insulting comments to some students who explained that they had to miss a week because they were observing the holiday.  \nOverall, one of the worst English classes I've taken in college, and one of the worst professors I've had at Columbia.  If you don't want to leave class angry every week, steer clear of this professor.  \nWorkload:\nLots of reading (around 150-200 pages a week), but it's good stuff.  Two 7-page papers.  Weird group presentations.\n"

And definitely always interesting, even if you think poetry should have ended with the dirty limerick. The best thing about Prof Mass, besides the crap Irish accent he puts on for Yeats classes, is that it's fine if you can't find a sensible narrative thread through his lectures, because you will never be asked to throw up his ideas or theories in a paper or on an exam. Every assignment is totally in the moment - it's all about your reading of this single poem. Handy for those of us with short memories.

I agree with some of the previous comments that, as far as learning about poetic syntax and whatnot goes, this class will not be satisfying. A previous reviewer said it's like a Poetry Appreciation course - quite right, too! I mean, I'd read some poems here and there, whether they were for class or just for kicks, but it wasn't until I'd taken this class that I fell in love with poetry. Prof. Mass is such a smart guy - I just want a look inside his mind because he will just throw anything at you, from Heraclitean flux to the Lotus Sutra, and then even throw in some references to 17th Century Japanese history in reference to that one John Ashbery poem we did. His lecture style is only very loosely structured - we stuck to the syllabus more or less, and we would have gotten through all of the works that Prof Mass wanted to go over had we not had that snow day (which he did keep referring back to... That damn snow...!) - and it broke down with an introduction to the poet, and then Prof. Mass jumping back and forth between poems and sparking discussion about it. The discussions were usually more thematic than anything - like I said, it's more of an appreciation class. He can also speak Spanish, French and Italian (maybe more?) well so he would read the poems in the original language every now and then, which was really lovely. He's a bit kooky, seems to really care about his students (you have to set up appointments, despite office hours, to talk to him, but he's pretty accessible via email), and I personally found his sense of humor really funny, so if you're looking for a class that you'll look forward to going to, I'd definitely recommend Prof. Mass's!\nWorkload:\n2 Responses (they could be close readings of any poem from the syllabus that we've discussed, or you can write a poem imitating the style of a poet that we've covered - 1 page), 3 papers (5 pages), and 1 final.\nThe final really wasn't as bad as previous reviewers made it seem - it was 15 IDs (identify the poet from a short passage from a poem, and explain briefly why you know it's that poet that wrote it), 10 passages (they're the same as IDs more or less but in more detail - the poet, the name of the poem, about the style, theme of the poem and how the passage reflects that, etc etc), and one essay.\n"

I don't think I heard him make a derogatory comment about Barnard throughout the entire semester.\nWith that cleared up, I enjoyed the class. He does tend to ramble on a bit, but what he has to say is usually quite interesting. His background with languages adds to the discussion, as he often talked about the differences in the connotations of language between the original text and the English translation. He definitely loves teaching this class. He does ask for people's opinions and encourage class discussion, but there will be times when he talks for an extended period of time about the book. You WILL need to do your reading; your essay grades will not hold up if you do not. You probably don't need to do all of it, but definitely enough to keep up in the discussions and be able to write knowledgeably about the book. \nI think the best thing about this class, as someone not enamored with literature, is the feedback on your papers. Prof Mass actually does read your papers, and he is not afraid to mark them up quite a bit. It will definitely not be easy to get an A on a paper, but it is doable.

            "review_content": "\nProf. Mass is an excellent professor. His class was extremely valuable to me, because his perspectives on each of the poets is a great combination of the official critical consensus and his own observations and crazy, quirky readings of the poems. He does occasionally get into weird topics (bringing in Kant's thing-in-itself, Heraclitean flux, etc.), but, hey, this is Columbia, and if you can follow him, his observations are almost always germane to the poem. The best thing I can say about this class is that there are about a half-dozen poems, maybe more, that I didn't know before I came into this class that have had a profound impact on me the way poetry (and literature in general) ought to.\nI understand why some reviewers have considered Prof. Mass overrated, and I consider some of the objections valid. For instance, Prof. Mass' lecture style is fairly disorganized; the first time you encounter a poet he'll usually give a biographical sketch, but after that, he'll just sort of find a poem he likes and ramble about it, bringing in ideas from philosophy, finding political/cultural references, explaining subtle (and not so subtle) allusions, connecting the poem to the poet's career as a whole, and occasionally asking questions. This would be unpleasant if his rambling wasn't 100% full of valuable observations about the poem at hand. Nevertheless, I can see where this style might irritate some students. The other thing about Prof Mass is that he doesn't generally go into many technical nuances of syntax or devices, or do line-by-line analysis of the poems. It's not that he can't (he does, every now and then); it's just that he tends to stay more general, making specific observations and dealing with how one thing connects to another, etc. I actually agree with the person that said this class was Modern Poetry Appreciation, and honestly, I feel that it should be. I'm sure there are more technically intensive classes out there, but going to class and getting Prof Mass' readings of some interesting poems, is, if nothing else, a great way to spend and hour and a half every monday and wednesday.\nAlso, fyi, he may or may not bring it up in the first couple of classes, but there are discussion sections that you will have to fit into your schedule. They're not technically mandatory, but they deal with a lot of the poems you don't get to in class, and they help the participation part of your grade.\nWorkload:\nTwo long essays, three short responses. A final which is medium difficulty (lots of passage IDs, which range from extremely easy to pretty hard). There's an expectation to participate either in class or in discussion sections which is part of your grade. Overall, not very difficult.\n"

He does that--or I should say that the poems do that. They're wonderful. But this is hardly sufficient for a 3000-level course at Columbia. The source of the problem, I think, is that Massimilla isn't an academic; he's a poet. He's a pretty good one but his perspective makes this a very limited class in my opinion. He doesn't  sustain coherent arguments. Like a connoisseur that will taste something and tell you how great it is and how it reminds him of that dish he had in Napa, Massimilla will spend a lot of time talking about how this poem is like another poem, or how lovely it is, or what category it belongs in, or how he once met the poet and what a funny man he was, etc. This is why I say it seemed more like a poetry appreciation class. There's much enthusiasm but not a whole lot of insight. The (rather obvious) assertion of the course as a whole was that there are multiple modernisms. I recall a very funny gourmet, lovely guy he was, who once waxed poetic on the world's varieties of salt: there's smoked and flaked and rock and...I nodded off after he started his classifying but before he ended it...which reminds me of a certain class that I once took.\n\nWorkload:\nNot much.

He can speak many languages, and was able to spout off our reading in italian and ancient greek, among others---adding an interesting twist of comp lit and 'reading in translation' and helping us read into deeper meaning and word play. He encouraged class discussion and was especially conscientious of making sure that everyone (even the shy) spoke up in class. He does mention that he teaches at other schools, including columbia and nyu, but never mentioned barnard in a derogatory light. He's really understanding about papers etc, and tries to help you figure out just what you're really trying to say. It was a great intro into english and i look forward to future classes with him.

The only good part about the class is that he loves to hear himself speak so you never have to do any of the reading for class since he'll do all the talking anyway.  Overall, I highly recommend avoiding him at all costs.\nWorkload:\nBare minimum for a FYE course.\n"

Not only does he know his stuff through and through (he often quotes extensive lines of poetry by memory, sometimes in the original language), he also has the vibrant personality to infuse every poem and poet with energy and make you equally interested and passionate in the subject matter as he is. To top it all off, Prof Mass is also HILARIOUS, and had us in stitches several times per class. Although he is a really sweet guy, Mass can sometimes seem arrogant (he once replied \"Who cares?\" to a particularly long winded and irrelevant question raised by a know-it-all in class), but this arrogance to me is endearing, because he has the intelligence and credibility to back it up. He packs plenty of information into each lecture, but you're not required to remember (or understand) everything. He exams are more of a test of analytical skills and application rather than memorization and rote regurgitation. \nIf you like whip-smart, slightly sassy, extremely intelligent professors, don't hesitate to take a class with him! \nWorkload:\nLight to Medium. Don't have to read every poem he assigns, just the important ones, which he goes over in class anyway. A few in-class responses, short papers, and an easy final at the end. \n"

Not because twenty years from now you'll go to some cocktail party where the host will oh so casually ask you what you think of the classics or because that blue & white seal of approval will look good on that piece of paper you are handed after four years of slaving away as your student loans reach astronomical proportions, but because the class actually helped you become a better writer and thinker. Modern poetry with Prof Mass is one of those classes. While the syllabus is definitely ambitious, I thought it very fair given the inclusive survey nature of the course and the time span covered (early to mid 20th century - a busy time for poets on both sides of the Atlantic). Prof Mass is a wonderful lecturer and always manages to make daunting material approachable. He never claims that his own reading of a text is the ONLY reading, as certain others poetry profs in this department love to do, which is refreshing. Rather, he provides a way of looking at a poem and encourages you to think about what you have read and take it a step further. His comments are informative and layered, paralleling the texts nicely. Like the poems we read, Prof Mass' lectures can be taken on a number of levels. If you love anecdotes, you will get great anecdotes. If you want an analysis of structure and language, he does an amazing job with that. If you're interested in biographical connections, you will get a ton of facts. If you would like to know more about the allusions, he will point out how the poem echoes other poems. Regardless, his readings are always thought-provoking and original. The nice thing with Prof Mass is that tries to provide a bit of everything, something both for the freshmen and the seniors. And he can actually do it. It's not as if he knows a lot about a small range of material, rather he knows a lot about almost everything. He's so well read, you might think he spent a couple of previous lives in Butler. However, he never lords it over you. \nHe seems to know almost instinctively what is appropriate and not appropriate material for a survey course. I don't know why some of the other reviewers thought he was full of himself. To me he seemed very down to earth in his own way, helpful with paper topics, willing to discuss extensions, a great resource for questions regarding secondary material, careful and deliberate in the manner he presented material, and (a miracle!) he actually reads your paper, unlike some of the people who teach surveys. Having taken classes with almost all the faculty in the English department, I can honestly say he's a wonderful professor and not just your average \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcintellectual entertainer.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hands down, this class was one of the best I've taken at Columbia.

While my hopes weren't exactly dashed against the rocks, they weren't quite fulfilled either. Prof Mass is quite the character and can be entertaining, but his treatment of the poems was often less than satisfactory. He crammed a ton of poets onto the syllabus. He did acknowledge several times that he was trying to tackle too much but that didn't deter him from trying - to the detriment of the quality of the class. We skimmed over several less well-known poets, but the time probably would've been better spent delving more deeply into major poets. His lectures were also disorganized; he went on a lot of tangents and would sometimes jump from poet to poet (trying to make connections but not always succeeding). Perhaps this style works for some people, but in general, it made it hard for me to appreciate the poems. Of course, his solution to the overly ambitious syllabus was to speak super fast during each lecture, but that ended up being counterproductive because it was then even harder to process the information and take notes. \nTo be fair, Prof Mass did repeat a lot of the major points, and those were what you needed to know for the final, but if you want to get anything more than a boiled-down, bulleted list of characteristics for each poet, then this class probably won't benefit you much (except for the fact that you get to read a ton of pretty cool poetry, but you can do that on your own). Yes, he is intelligent and enthusiastic, and he definitely knows his stuff, but at times, it seems to be more about how much he knows (and who he knows) than about teaching the material. \nWorkload:\nTwo 4-5 page papers (with pretty broad topics), three 1-2 page responses, easy final (IDs all came from poems discussed in class).\n"

He's enthusiastic, multi-lingual, and has vast stocks of poetry memorized. He'll tell a funny anecdote from time to time, and does a respectable Brando impersonation. That's all very lovable, as his groupies will attest. But his treatments of the modernist poets are very superficial. This is a lecture/survey course, so a degree of generality is to be expected, but Massimilla will either give you the sparknotes reading of a poem or delve into esoterica about it that's occasionally interesting but not very useful. At the end of the course, looking over my notes, I realized that I didn't jot much down, and not for a lack of attention--he just didn't say much worth remembering. That I think sums it up. This is fine for a low-pressure class, but it's very frustrating if you have genuine curiosity about the material. There are far better classes and professors than this in the department. In other words, he's the poetry version of Bruce Robbins, if you know what I mean (pedagogic reputation far exceeds actual worth).\nWorkload:\nTwo short essays, three responses, final.\n"
