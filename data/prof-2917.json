He's pretty chill because he's still working towards his Ph.D and he remembers what it's liek to be in college.  I went to his office hours alot for papers for other classes and he helped me with those too.  \n\n\nWorkload:\nregular amount for UW: conversation essay, lens essay, CCP, group CCP, a fair grader.\n\n"
