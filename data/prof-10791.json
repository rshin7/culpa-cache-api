She is a tough grader, though, and her comments on papers are sometimes confusing or contradictory. Some of her flaws can be blamed on the class itself, which is often overcomplicated simple writing assignments. I really recommend going to see her as often as possible during the writing process, as her comments often need clarification and she's much more helpful one-on-one. I had a great time in the class, however, and look back on it fondly. You will occasionally be frustrated by her, but it should all work out in the end. Just don't expect to get an A.\nWorkload:\nPretty average for UW, 4 papers, short writing assignments due almost every class\n"
