Sure, he could have disguised the preferential treatment a little better but if you think about it, he was really lenient on us in class. He could've been MUCH stricter by, for example, deducting points wherever he could for things like not removing the funnel from the buret. Matt was a really great TA overall and I give him two thumbs up.\n"
