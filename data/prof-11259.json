            "review_content": "\nProfessor Johnson made Music Hum a bearable experience with his humor, enthusiasm and encouragement. I didn't particularly like the Music Hum curriculum -- I think it is just to unreasonable to expect students with no classical musical training to be able to hear and appreciate structural elements of music that normally require years of exposure to perceive -- but Professor Johnson always made himself available to help us and was always responsive to our questions. \nWorkload:\nTwo quizzes together worth 15% of the grade (3 known pieces of music to ID + one unknown piece to describe), midterm (20%), final (20%), attendance and participation (15%), 4-page concert report (10%), 6-8 page close listening paper (20%).\n"
