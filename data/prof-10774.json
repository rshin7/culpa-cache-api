The packet that comes with our syllabus was insanely helpful. She is very straight-forward but not curt, so you feel encouraged to share your thoughts or ideas but the class also stays on track. I enjoyed the essays she chose for us to read and she facilitated discussions well. \nShe works VERY hard on grading papers and got them back to us astonishingly quickly. She also gives wonderfully helpful and clear feedback and has no problem helping people develop their ideas. Her grading is super fair and reflects the work you put into your assignments. University Writing is a notoriously tough unavoidable class, and I'm glad I took it with her. \nWorkload:\n4 Essays, 3rd one is a research paper and a BEAST. \nWeekly readings \nTime spent rewriting and rewriting drafts\nReviewing peer essays (read/write feedback/correct occasionally)\n"
