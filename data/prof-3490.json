            "review_content": "\nI took both semesters of Art History with Patrick, one of the most helpful, energetic, and interesting teachers I've had at Barnard. Not only was he incredibly intelligent and excited about what he was teaching, but he also pushed all of us to really think about works of art and probe deeper. He was always willing to listen to different ideas and never acted condescending; he was really down to earth and made an effort to get to know everyone in my section. He also was very helpful and available outside of class (I probably went to him for help with papers at least 5 times) and was always willing to read and give feedback on drafts. If you're taking Intro to Art History at Barnard, definitely try to get him as a TA. \n\n"
