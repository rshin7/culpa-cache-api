He's very messy, and classes are really boring (Though I admit its hard to make Math interesting sometimes). Add to that really annoying exams that do not test your comprehension of the material, but whether u can memorize the solution or solve the answer to some really complex integration problem. Tests will demoralise you, I don't understand why he likes doing that. In all, a lousy instructor and Professor. Do not take his class unless you know the math already.\nWorkload:\n1 Problem Set (approx 20 questions); 2 insanely difficult midterms and a silly final.\n"

            "review_content": "\nOK, so Professor Osvath screwed up the first midterm, rendering two of the four questions impossible to solve. He gave people full credit if they got as far as feasibly possible, and counted the whole midterm less in our final grade.  However, on the whole, he is one of the better calculus professors I have had.  The class made me reconsider my loathing of math. He is very enthusiastic and really enjoys it when students come to office hours.  The class was frsutrating because everyone in it just cared about their grade.  He was a very personable professor and tried to learn everyone's name to answer their questions directly (which is saying something considering the class was around 50 people).  His tests were decently difficult, but you really know what to expect.  Learn the fundamental concepts of the class from the book,and be willing to think about them critically and apply them to less familiar situations.  The course was very generously curved; he wanted to make sure that no one wanted to fail.\nWorkload:\nweekly problem sets- They weren't hard, so much as unfairly graded by our TA.\n2 Midterms- The first was hard due to oversights by Prof. Oszvath. The second required only confidence in using a few basic principles (line integrals, Greene's theorem, surface integrals, etc.), and a challenging final, which included all of the material as well as reusing old approaches to integration from earlier classes.\nOverall, not too much work.\n"

He attempts to incorporate graduate concepts into the lectures..(then they find their way into the exams and you are really screwed) I got a B- in his class...my lowest grade here to far....I really do not recommend him \nWorkload:\nweekly psets which are long but not particularly challenging....midterm was a bitch  final would have been challenging for graduate students\n"

He's very fluid with his grading, too... not necessarily in a good way. Our final ended up being 60% of the grade because he made so many mistakes on our midterms that he threw it out. On midterm days, he'll show up as if he stayed up all night writing the test.  I don't recommend this guy, and I like calculus. \nIt's definitely not the course.\nWorkload:\nNot too bad. One problem set a week, even on weeks with tests. \n"

Gets way too sidetracked when teaching lectures in class, falls behind on material, and then gives absurd tests -- one test this term, after we'd all boned up on difficult material like Stokes' Thm. and double integrals, the test wanted us to integrate arcsecant as part of a regular problem. That sort of thing -- the tests would be fine if you had a Calc II or III textbook on hand, but require ridiculous command of obscure knowledge. Class average on the final 200-point exam was around a 60, which is low even for a curved class.\nIt doesn't help that Calc IV is full of completely disinterested engineers, though -- all the class did was complain, and after awhile he just stopped listening to anyone. Not good form.\nIt's tough to be bitter -- the curve is intense and despite doing poorly all term I got an A-. This will probably not be true in future semesters. Not recommended.\nWorkload:\nStraightforward -- a problem set every week that's usually not too brutal, then a midterm and a final that cover roughly *none* of that material.\n"

I came into this class, having taken Multivariable Calc. but not understanding any of what I had learned. I am so amazed now that I understand everything we have gone through. He is not only a good teacher that makes things easy to understand, he genuinely cares for his students. He even had a review session for our second midterm on a Sunday night on his own time. He's even funny and affable! He loves when you volunteer in class and tries his best to learn as many students' names as possible. One of his pet peeves is probably students who don't come to class, so come to class!!! He is absent-minded, though.. He messed up 2 out of 5 of the first midterm questions, so that midterm was counted half of the amount of the second one. All in all, a great teacher that made me laugh! \nWorkload:\npsets took me about 2 hrs each, 1st midterm was okay besides the fact that he messed it up... haven't taken final or 2nd midterm yet.\n"

Ozvath is a little disorganized at times, there are moments when I'm not sure he even knows what he's talking about. But he clearly loves the subject, and sees it a different way from all the other teachers I've ever had. He's extremely good natured, loves it when you participate, but won't give you a hard time if you don't. He'll occasionally call on the silent one in the back just for fun, but this isn't half as intimidating as he thinks it is. \n"
