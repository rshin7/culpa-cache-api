His lectures don't explain things well and his handwriting is hard to read and he is sometimes hard to hear. He is quite boring and monotone. One thing though is he often gives background explanations/proofs for equations that are often not seen in the textbook. There are weekly graded homework assignments due which help a lot. The TAs are not present. Attendance isn't taken.\nWorkload:\n8 hours per week. 2 midterms 1 final. \n"

            "review_content": "\nIt is funny how Professor Harris talks to himself all the time. I mean, he looks at the board, writes and talks. That is as confusing as mathematical concepts go. Practically very little of the class understands him. Self-study is utmost necessary.\nWould not advise.\nWorkload:\nProblem set every week; two midterms (practices are helpful--but the actual midterm is still exceedingly hard); one final. Lots more self-study required.\n"
