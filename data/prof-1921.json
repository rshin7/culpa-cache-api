            "review_content": "\nBettendorf is a really great guy. He's a pretty solid teacher, but he tends to get very distracted and subsequently wastes a lot of time and ends up holding the class for 5 minutes or so at the end. He is very available to meet outside of class, and he really takes the time to get to know each student. He does a great job of clarifying the material and even of helping to better explain things we learn in Diatonic. I will definitely miss him next year in ET III.\nWorkload:\nAlmost no homework -- occasionally you need to write a melody or a 4-measure rhythm, but those are very simple. One midterm and one final. Very manageable.\n"

            "review_content": "\nCarl Bettendorf is the best. He's a great teacher and composer (he writes some really cool contemporary/new music, so if you're into that stuff you should take a listen!), and extremely friendly and approachable. He is also very chatty, always a fun person to talk with! If you ever need help he's really nice about it and will give you a detailed explanation of what he expects from you and how to do it. Even though he knows his stuff and is an awesome musician, he is a great, down-to-earth guy. In addition to music, you'll learn a lot about soccer. You'll also learn about his life; he tells hilarious stories. Ear-training with Carl was a rewarding experience. He is very lenient and does not take off many points if you get things wrong, but tests are very straight-forward and if you can do the exercises in class, you'll get an A+. So if you want a very funny and cool professor, take a class with Carl, you'll love it :)\nWorkload:\njust go to class, very little homework. a few quizzes, midterm, and final. all easy stuff (but still put in a little effort) :)\n"

            "review_content": "\nCarl is hilarious. Such a cooky, entertaining guy. He's a really chill professor and doesn't assume an air of superiority, even though he is a fantastic composer. For Ear Training, I can't imagine anyone better. He's very clear about the work and is pretty generous on quizzes and listening examples. For fundamentals, same deal, though the class was a little boring, but that's just because the class itself is a bit boring. Carl did a good job of keeping his energy up, though.\nWorkload:\nEar training: almost nothing. sometimes some written homework where you'll have to write a couple melodies, but usually just sight singing melodies.\nFundamentals: annoying homeworks, but they weren't too bad. just busy work, not too long though, and it wouldn't be due every single class. the quizzes were pretty easy as long as you know the material. i didn't have to study because i had already learned the material in high school music theory, so perhaps my opinion is skewed. nonetheless carl is great\n"

            "review_content": "\nHaving Carl as a teacher has been one of the most rewarding experiences Columbia has given me thus far. In his class you will assuredly learn as much about life (a lot about Carl's life, which is highly entertaining) as you will about ear training. I was always impressed that even with all the hysterical anecdotes and conversations, we did get through every exercise we needed to in every class. \nIn addition to all the life stories, Carl also sometimes throws in interesting background information regarding other compositions or his own work which is always cool to hear about. \nTake the class with Carl. Take any class with Carl if you get  a chance. Its worth it!\nWorkload:\nClasses are short and fly by, quizzes about every other week, but there are no surprises. Do the little bits of reviewing or HW that he asks you, if you have trouble with something make the extra effort to do it well, and you'll do fine. \n"

            "review_content": "\nI imagine there are plenty of people at Columbia who think the Core is a good idea (or at least who thought so when they came), but I doubt that anyone is glad for the chance to take Music Hum. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong, I think music in the curriculum is a good idea. But does anyone really need three hours a week to learn what Beethoven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fifth Symphony sounds like? Or what a major scale is? Really? How did you get through eighteen years without hearing Beethoven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fifth Symphony somewhere? Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t your parents have a TV? Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you see \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Breakfast Club\u00e2\u20ac\u009d? Or that movie about the dog named \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beethoven\u00e2\u20ac\u009d? Or what about the major scale? Did you never see \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Sound of Music\u00e2\u20ac\u009d? Did no one ever sing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Happy Birthday\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to you in your whole life?\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to get excited about a course designed to introduce you to the ten most famous pieces of music of all time (all of which you will know if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fantasia\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or been in the same room with a radio), along with some medieval music that pretty much nobody cares about and some electronic music that absolutely nobody cares about. But there may be some of us who need this sort of thing: for example, when we were told that Schubert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Erlk\u00c3\u00b6nig\u00e2\u20ac\u009d sold a large number of copies shortly after its publication, one kid in the class\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI think he was an athlete\u00e2\u20ac\u201dasked if the copies were sold on vinyl. (That was 1821.) But the point of this is to demonstrate that there is no hope of enjoying Music Hum, because either you will already know most of the music on the syllabus, or (if you somehow managed, maybe by wearing earplugs since you were born, never to hear the pieces playing every minute on every radio in every waiting room in the universe) then you probably don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know anything about classical music.\nWhich means the goal is to get the highest grade possible for the least commitment possible, and if that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re after, then Carl Christian Bettendorf is your man. The workload consists of a midterm (45 minutes), a final (also 45 minutes, miraculously) and a three-page concert report in which you can say anything you like as long as you refer to the piece, the composer, or the style of performance (and really, what else would you say?) That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all. But it gets better: when he plays pieces for you to identify on the exams, he drops hints like crazy. Just in case you never did the listening assignments, he picks opera passages in which you can hear the characters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 names distinctly, and just before that happens he says something like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now listen carefully, so you can hear the character\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name, coming up,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and then points to the stereo just when it happens, in case there was any doubt.\nAlso, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wonderful guy. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very sweet, and has a mellifluous German accent, and a sweet little tufty haircut, and sometimes gets excited talking about modern composers. You should absolutely take his class, because he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lovely fellow whom you should get to know, and because if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re clever enough to tie your shoes you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get an A+. And if not, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably get an A.\n\nWorkload:\nSee above.\n"
