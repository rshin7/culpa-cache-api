            "review_content": "\nProfessor Aguilar is my favorite professor I've ever had (granted I just finished freshman year and have only had 9 professors, so take that as you will). She is my favorite type of professor (the ones who scare you shitless so that you do well, but then let slip that they actually are nice people who do care about you). While she was very strict and demanding I learned a lot in that class and also managed to have a lot of fun (she has a lot of great stories that she tells anyone who is willing to listen). I would love to take another class with her (regardless of subject matter) before I graduate.\nWorkload:\nProbably more than most Intermediate I classes. A lot of worksheets, a couple of essays, a couple in class essays. However there was no oral exam or final project like many other classes had.\n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Aguilar is brilliant; she is clearly an assiduous intellectual and there are times that I think she actually enjoys teaching. She could be an extraordinary professor, however, she is impatient, intolerant of mistakes, intimidating, and borderline verbally abusive. Disparaging comments were not uncommon throughout the course; she stops her feet, yells, and she even managed to make a girl cry in my class, as well. Profesora Aguilar could be an amazing professor if she would maintain her professionalism and watch her temper (which flared almost every single class period). Other than her regular temper tantrums, she's a great professor. In my opinion, though, belittling students with constant degrading comments is unacceptable and frankly, inexcusable. \nGood luck with getting feedback on graded essay assignments. Professor Aguilar's comments/corrections on papers were completely illegible. She is a thorough grader but unfortunately, corrections are worthless as you cannot understand what any of it means (and this is not for a terrible paper - I never got anything less than a B on any graded assignment). \nOn the plus side - Professor Aguilar is terrifying and as a result, you work extremely hard to avoid her wrath. You DO learn a lot, but you'll have to decide if it's worth the many hours of therapy that you'll be needing once you finish the course. \nWorkload:\nIt's definitely doable but probably more than other Spanish courses. You'll write at least 3-4 graded essays and have a couple in class essays. Lots of worksheets, reading (Casa Tomada and La Lengua de las Mariposas), and movies (you'll be assigned 3 movies to watch outside of class that you'll discuss and write about). In class you'll listen to Spanish opera and read 12th century Spanish poetry. It's a good class but certainly not for the faint of heart. \n"

I learned much more from her in a month or so than I did from my first semester \"easy\" professor. Professor de Aguilar is not for the faint hearted, however. She made a girl in my class cry during her oral presentation. Her grammar worksheets really help you understand the material, and make the departmental midterms easy. Also, go to Aguilar's office hours.   \nWorkload:\nI would say more than other 1202 professors. Grammar worksheets, but same rubric as other classes. \n"

For me, her grammatical worksheets translated into a Latina lovefest.\nI took Spanish Intermediate II with Profesora Aguilar, and I learned a ton.  I recommend taking her class if you really care about learning the language, because she will teach you.  If you're just satisfying the language requirement, find someone else.  She has a very thorough understanding of Spanish, English, and apparently several other languages, and she had excellent explanations for all of my questions.  She will repeat the key concepts until the class understands it, but don't expect her to be happy about repeating things if it takes you longer than it should.  Do her assignments and you'll be fine.\nShe likes to bring cultural elements into the class, which I thought made it much more interesting.  She's very interesting to talk to, and it will help you to do so in her office hours.\nWorkload:\nMore than most Spanish Intermediate II sections, but not unreasonable.  The extra work does help learn the material, so if you want to learn it's worthwhile.\n"

            "review_content": "\nI am not the type of person who reviews professors badly, but this experience was something terrible.\nTo give her a little credit, I liked her a lot. I thought she was smart and funny and she knew a lot about music and art and humanities.  Does she care if her stories are interesting?  No, but that's what's funny about her.  Her clothing was weird, she was kooky, and she is knowledgeable in a lot of subjects, but also insecure as hell.  A friend of mine knows her as a person, not a professor, and loves her.  I could see that happening, but unfortunately I had the displeasure to be in her class.\nShe is also terrifying in appearance and personality.  Once she threw something at a student, she yelled, screamed, etc.  I have blocked out a good deal of her class because I sat there hoping that she wouldn't call on me the entire time, and saw most of the class tremble uncontrollably in her presence.  The only people who did well or enjoyed it were people who took a too low level Spanish class for an easy A.  She does not encourage you to talk to or to be friendly with the other people in the class.  The only thing you can do is similarly lament the C- you received on another paper or quiz.\nOffice hours are helpful, but she mostly complains that other Spanish teachers are too easy, talks about her time in the 1960s, quotes Bertram Russell, etc, etc.  She expects you to remember everything she says, even if she says it once.  I am not a language person, and this was my first language class at Columbia.  I left convinced I was an idiot with no capability to ever learn Spanish, and it was incredibly scarring and follows me today, even after a great Intermediate II Professor and two months in Latin America.  If you are a Spanish speaker or a masochist, this could be great.  Otherwise, steer clear.\nWorkload:\nabsurdly hard.  Daily homeworks that are graded, many quizzes (sometimes unannounced), departmental midterm and final, reading that is departmentally mandated but not at most student's level\n"

She is quick to get frustrated with the level of language skill of her students, and can be very intimidating in class.  She also can make you feel really stupid when you get things wrong.  This aside, she really wants to see her students succeed.  \nWithin the first few days of class she explains how she factors how hard students try into their grades.  This is true.  While the grades you get throughout the semester don't show it, your final grade will.  Just make sure she knows you are putting in the effort.  \nGO TO OFFICE HOURS.  If you don't she will not let you live it down.  Plus, going is actually really helpful - even if you don't go for anything specific.\nProfessor de Aguilar is also crazy.  Honestly.  She sings in class (she's really good), and she tells hilarious stories and jokes, but she is also a little nuts.  Personally, I enjoyed it.  It made class interesting.  \nBottom line: she is a good, tough professor.  It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.  \nWorkload:\nLots.  A lot of homework - worksheets, stories, and 1-2 paragraph essays.  It's not too difficult, just time consuming.  There are a few quizzes, a midterm, a final, and some graded homework assignments and essays.  Go to office hours.  Go to class. \n"

Not only that but she will teach you more than just spanish. Class is never ever boring. If she's not telling you about her days as a professional singer, she's reciting poetry from memory.\nIf you want to just finish your language requirement, then this professor is not the one for you. But if you want to be challenged, have some fun, and actually LEARN then definitely take this class.\nWorkload:\nMaybe 1 quiz a week, 4/5 oral exams which are really more like group discussions in-class, weekly writing assignments, and one test each quarter.\nShe doesn't write the midterm or the final so, as her student, you find them disgustingly easy.\n"

However, if you want to improve your writing and learn a great deal then she's the professor for you. She was exceedingly knowledable about EVERYTHING. Her lectures were interesting because they often went wherever the students lead them. She is a very tough grader of your work, and it will not be uncommon to get a B or B- on some of your responses. However, at the end of the semester she seems to take a lot of other factors into consideration. I received pretty much straight B+'s on responses (a few A-'s and B's) and B on the midterm. However, I went to every class and finished with an A-. As for approachability, she is very friendly. I went to her office hours several times and she was always willing to discuss your work, and with most students would even up your grade 1/3 of a letter grade on an assignment if you went to see her. \nWorkload:\n6 reponse papers, one long paper, midterm, final, and presentation.

            "review_content": "\nIf you had asked me in October, I would have said that Profesora Aguilar was the greatest professor I had ever had at Columbia. Others have already said it here: she knows EVERYTHING, she quotes whole poems, sings songs - everything from Italian opera to Mexican folk songs to Schubert's Lieder to Gilbert & Sullivan operettas, she has a witty obscure quotation from someone famous for everything. Just, really fabulous professor who will awe you with her knowledge.\nSomewhere in October or November though, the enthusiasm in her, and in the class, died. It became tedious to go to, and I can't say why. She seemed less the glorious performer I was in awe of, and more annoyed to be there. She chimed in with the occasional song and poem or quotation, but it seemed half-hearted. It was unfortunate, because before that, she had been the best professor I had encountered.\nShe certainly was not the evil person described for the earlier classes in this class. I think because at the 3000 level, people want to be there. The workload wasn't ridiculous, and even if you hadn't done the work (one time, I had forgotten something), she just skipped over you and looked forgiving - didn't yell at or berate you. If it was clear you were just makign it up because you hadn't read (not that you didn't understand, she forgave that), she could give you the death stare, but wouldn't say anything.\nThe workload was fine: the short stories were fun to read, and enthralling to discuss in class because of all the things she'd bring to the surface about them, or comparing them to world literature (very often German literature, which as a German student, was cool to see some overlap). The poetry block could be sort of tedious or boring. We never got to the book, so I can't comment on that. \nWhats really clear is that she wants you to learn and to do well. She lets you hand in a 1-2 page ungraded response paper every couple of weeks before your longer papers where she encourages you to try out large phrases you might want to use in your bigger papers without the penalty of getting them wrong and being marked down, which is probably where I learned the most in this class. The papers increase in length from 3-5 to 4-6, to a final 5-7 page paper. They seem to be graded harshly, but as she'll tell you at the end of the class, these grades are more what you \"earned.\" She inflates your final grade to the inflated standard.\nOverall: this class was one I enjoyed, but was disappointed by the profound drop in enthusiasm half way through. Had it kept up, it would have been the greatest class I had taken at Columbia, and de Aguilar the best professor. She definitely is among the Spanish department's greatest teachers.    \nWorkload:\nReading for each class from 15-45 pages. Shorter during the poetry block. 1-2 page ungraded reading responses, 3 long essays. Final. \n"

She would chastise students who did not come up with the answer right away, and boy does she pick favorites.

She loves the material that she teaches and knows the material extremely well, to the point of being able to quote from most of the works we read, in addition to obscure 12th century philosophers and famous 20th century gravediggers - I exaggerate here, but Aguilar does operate under the assumption that she probably knows more than you ever will or could hope to, and so whatever she says will be of some educational value. I can see how she could be intimidating to people who either don't do the reading or have continued trouble understanding the works, but if you keep up with the assignments and go to her office hours (which are numerous and convenient, to my mind) then you stand a good chance to get a whole lot out of her class. The lectures on the history of latin american literature are boring, but I would fault the class structure itself, rather than Aguilar's teaching style. Her enthusiasm is infectious. \nWorkload:\nSmall(ish) but persistent reading assignments that really catch up if you don't read continually. 5 3-4 pg. essays, a fairly simple translation project, and an easy final. \n"

            "review_content": "\nProfessor Aguilar is quite unique. She is amazingly intelligent. She frequently, for instance, recites entire poems from memory when she is reminded of them by the class discussion. She certainly knows the material, and is not afraid to display this immense knowledge. Often, she talks too much in class, and somewhat disturbs the class discussion. She is, though, pretty interesting, so it's not too bad. The stories you read in class are generally good. Really the only bad part of the course was that Prof. Aguilar ocassionally decided to give lectures about the history of hispanic literature. These lectures were boring, and often hard to understand. In general, Professor Aguilar is a good teacher. She has office hours for several hours every single day, so she is readily available for extra help. She grades fairly, but does give a pretty large amount of work. Although she can certainly be intimidating, she is a kind person.\nWorkload:\nReading for every class (probably average about 1 short story per class). At the end of the course, you read an entire novel. 4 papers varying in length (average about 3-4 pages). 1 in-class \"presentation,\" in which you have to lead the discussion about one of the short stories. 1 translation project (not too difficult). Fairly easy final exam.\n"

But it is true, if you get her to like you, you're home free.  If not, prepare to be called on a lot.  She does this with good intentions though, because she concentrates on the weaker students in order to get them to learn Spanish.  Don't slack off, work hard, study grammar and don't forget it.  Be active in class, she values that a lot.  She is always available during office hours.  If you do what she tells you to, you will doubtlessly leave that class knowing a good deal of Spanish.  I would recommend her if you want to learn Spanish and are willing to work hard.  This is not as important, but try to address her with the Usted form or she will correct you.\nWorkload:\n15-30 minute homework given most days.  A few essays throughout the semester.  Tests most weeks on very little material.  Department midterm and final are shmeezy the way she prepares you for them.  Oral presentation at the end of the semester which she says doesn't count for much because she has seen your speaking abilities throughout the semester.  Buena Suerte!\n"

Unless you already know spanish and are taking the class for an A+ all 4 semesters, this is not the professor for you.  Most students sit in constant fear they will be called on.... which then follows in insults and guilt trips if you dare to answer incorrectly.  She calls at least two to three students stupid a week, her workload is overboard, and Ds and Fs on her quizes and tests are the norm.  Office hours are even worse because you have to talk to her one on one, but you pretty much have to go and pretend to want to really comprehend spanish.  The first 5 minutes of class that she is always late to in the morning was the best part of my day *CULPA censor*  Run as fast as you can.  Taking her class was easily the worst move I have ever made at Columbia.  \nWorkload:\ndepartment midterm and final - which will save your shitty grade, loads of daily busy work, weekly quizes and tests that most of the class fails.\n"

BUT, if you show that you're willing to put in the work to do well, there's not a friendlier teacher in the school. She holds office hours almost every day, and will help you with your conversation, your writing, and even your tests if you ask her. She has very little patience for people who do poorly and then say, \"I just don't get Spanish, I'm not good at it,\" so if you're the kind of person who's looking to coast, stay away. But if you want to learn the language, and are looking for a teacher who will make you do it, Professor Aguilar is the one. Overall, it's a matter of personal taste; if you get her to like you, it'll be a fantastic class for you.\nWorkload:\nModerate to heavy. She's primarily concerned with whether or not you're actually learning the language. Lots of compositions, lots of workbook exercises, and while she's a fairly harsh grader, you can easily get your grade raised by going to talk to her. Department midterm and final, both are killer, but she prepares the class as best she can.\n"

One thing I wanted to add for people considering taking this class is that while it is a good introduction to Latin American literature, you will learn nothing about Latin America itself.  Aguilar is a very traditional intellectual, and for that reason she is completely uninterested and even sometimes repulsed by discussion of politics and context in literature.  Still, she's a smart lady and it's interesting to see what the old school has to say.\nWorkload:\nnot bad at all, seeing as she doesn't even care if you turn in papers late.

Aguilar is more concerned with you learning the material, so she'll conduct the class based on the speed the students are going at, and will teach and reteach concepts and quiz you on them until everyone does well. And she continuously says not to worry about the letter/numerical grades you get on the quizzes and tests, because she will give you your grade based on how well SHE thinks you're doing in class --which you can take at face value, I suppose, but it can also be a teacher's way of saying \"get on my bad side and pay the price.\" But I have to say, it was definitely more of a motivation to learn when I was worrying more about my progress in understanding the language than what was showing up on paper. Be prepared for her to scold you if you're not doing something right, though. And for her randomly to break out into Spanish song (which she likes to teach).\nWorkload:\nIt really seems like a lot -- and it is -- so prepare to be overwhelmed, at first, when she has you write a 1-2-pg (single spaced!!) essay, or assigns you a 5-10-pg short story over the first weekend.

I think the F Fairy also visited my class a few times. However, you WILL learn a lot. I can conjugate in my sleep now and my ability to speak has improved infinitely because of her. This class is very challenging, but there were some fun times, too. One-on-one, she is very kind, helpful, and funny; in the classroom, though, she is much more intimidating (but still somewhat funny). The professor has a beautiful voice and she sang to us on a few occasions. The projects in this class were more interesting than most, too. You will be put on the spot a few times and you may get called a few names, but I think it's worth it. If you are serious about improving your language skills (you learn stuff that improves your comprehension of ANY language), then this is the class for you. It's a true challenge.
