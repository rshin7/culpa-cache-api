I would go into the recitation understanding the lesson and after a seemingly never-ending session with Gabe couldn't make sense of anything. Most of the recitation was spent waiting for him to grace us with his presence, and the rest of the time was wasted on watching him scratch his head in confusion. To make matters worse, he has an obnoxious personality, as was typified by his t-shirt emblazoned with \"i > u,\" and he hardly ever handed back our homework. He made physics even more unbearable. \nWorkload:\nN/A\n"
