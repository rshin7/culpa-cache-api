If you are looking to be fluent in Portuguese once you're done, she is the perfect professor. Her work can be challenging but she will go out of her way to help you if you are struggling. She does every thing in her power to help you succeed if you want to. \nIf you are lazy this is not the class for you because she does move quickly and covers lots of material. Many people leave language classes able to read and write but struggle with speaking. If you take Portuguese with Ana Paula this will not be a problem for you.\nWorkload:\n5 5-minute oral presentations, 3 10-minute oral presentations, 7 2-page essays, 5 1-page essays, weekly posts on wikipage, daily book assignments, midterm & final\n"
